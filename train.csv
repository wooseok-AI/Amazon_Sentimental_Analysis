"J brand is by far the best premium denim line retailer sells! the fit on these jeans is amazing..worth every penny..also, considering it is a crop jean - warm weather wear - the denim weight is light and not too thick...the color is different from ordinary regular denim blue..lighter wash for spring/summer!",pos
I loved this dress. i kept putting it on trying to figure out how to get my boobs to not fall out all over the place. this is not a dress for larger breasts. it is absolutely beautiful otherwise!,pos
"I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8""). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!",pos
"This picture does not due this sweater justice, at all! i purchased this today for summer. it's beyond cute and the colors are awesome! it's a very light sweater with a fitted (but not too tight) light feel. the sleeves are a little longer than quarter length, at least on me. it looks amazing with white pants, very fresh!!",pos
"I am 5' 4"", a size 8-10 (size 29/30), and my figure is apple-ish. i can't pull off peplum tops because they are too tight for my shape and they flare out at an unflattering spot. all of those ""rules"" go out the window with this tankini.

first, swimsuits are supposed to be tight, so that problem is eliminated right away.
second, the flare-out is perfect for women that want to hide their tummies. i don't like how swimsuits are generally tight in the tummy - that's the area that i'd like to hide t",pos
I can't wait for the milder weather to arrive so i can wear this tunic. it is very stylish and elegant and one of those rare pieces that makes you feel good wearing it.,pos
"This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom, making it very flattering. lots of compliments!",pos
"Looks just like it does on the model. i am 5'130lbs and the ps fits perfectly. i wore mine with a t and wedges. adorable and more importantly, comfortable! flows nicely without being distracting. got lots of compliments.",pos
"Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.",pos
"Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.",pos
"I'm 5'7"", 120 lbs, size 0 was best.  ordered the green color.  great flattering fit!",pos
"I absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that i'd be wearing them all summer long. they fit beautifully, were true to size, and seemed to go with every top i owned. unfortunately, on the second wear, the inseam completely unraveled, leaving a foot-long gaping hole in the leg. i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams, so i'm not thrilled with the quality. it seems like they were poorly manufactured. i'm not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t",neg
"I wanted to love this dress, it looks beautiful on the model but it isn't the flattering, even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it, it it runs pretty big.",neg
"I agree with other reviewer, the material of these jeans is not the same! thin, stretches, and you end up pulling them up all the time. i am a short, curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back! this seems to be the trend in jeans?nydj also uses this fabric?stretches too much.",neg
"These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful, comfortable, and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention.",pos
I didn't realize how much i would love this. wore it to work the other day and got more compliments than i have in a very long time on an outfit! it's comfortable and easy and flattering. bought this totally on a whim and so glad i did!,pos
"This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site, so i ordered it online. it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on. looks like i took a floor rug, cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head. the sweater itself is so pretty, its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me. i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs. its kind of itchy too. will be returning this asap.",neg
I loved this top . it is beautiful.,pos
"The model doesn't do this jumpsuit justice. absolutely gorgeous!  beautifully constructed,  cute details,  flows well,  easy to dress up or down...
5'5"" 135 34 c- the 6 was perfect.",pos
"This worked for me, very elegant, cozy and comfortable.",pos
"This is the best item i have gotten form retailer. the quality is amazing. soft, covers my butt, classic piece!!!",pos
"I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts:
_________________
pros:
- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.
- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)
- the length is ideal for taller folk.
- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this won't be an issue.
- nicely conservative at the top.

cons:
- i",pos
"This is the perfect summer dress. it can be dressed up or down. the quality of the linen fabric is very nice. i'm 5'1"" and it hit right below my knees. i found it to run true to size. those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size, but the tie in the front can be adjusted. it's lovely.",pos
"Ok. so this coat is amazing! it's high quality, soft, great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it's been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code, so for me, that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try",pos
These are a comfortable and fashionable pair of shorts!  they run true to size and look great!,pos
"This dress is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price, but i just couldn't resist. it's so flowy and comfortable. it's quite long on me; i'm 5'5 and have to wear heels so that it doesn't drag, but could easily be fixed with alerations. i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments.",pos
This is my new favorite sweater. soft and comfortable and easy to wear to both work and play. being able to wear different things under this makes it very versatile and easy to change looks.,pos
Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!,pos
"This tunic is just adorable. material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory. i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color, perfect for spring. the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touch.
fit is tts. i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly. i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in",pos
"I have never purchased printed pants before, but i was so smitten with the cute little shells that i had to try them on. i was impressed with the fabric, which has some thickness to it but will still be perfect for summer. i also have athletic calves and unlike other cartonnier pants i've tried, i had no trouble getting these over my legs! win win! i'm usually a size 8 and while it was fitted (not loose like on the model) i know they will stretch. being 5'4'' i'm just on the boarder of having mo",pos
"I got the black in size small. i love this easy, breezy and comfy t. i love that it's different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer. 

i'm a size 2 and bought a small.",pos
"This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets, but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2"" , 120 lbs., but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips, but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled, but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!",pos
This is a super cute jumpsuit that is also super comfortable. the only thing i wish was different on this jumpsuit is that the pants would go all the way to the ground. but it is still super cute and a keeper !,pos
"I passed over this dress online thinking i'd never wear it. but, then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on. i am excited to say that i love this dress. it is soft and lovely. the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape. my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional. opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for.",pos
"I love coats and have a collection of unique ones and this one is in my top 3! wow is it a stunner! totally different and very classy. not my every day coat but will be used for dinner outings and special occasions with the right outfit. i did reinforce the buttons since there had been many complaints about that, which is why i only gave it 4 stars for quality. great design on this one retailer!",pos
"Absolutely love this piece! 5'6 and 120 lbs and ordered a small, fits perfectly. this jumpsuit has become a regular in my outfit rotation, i get compliments every time i wear it.",pos
Love everything about this sweater. i usually wear xs in most retailer tops but had to exchange for a s. hope this helps!,pos
I love this dress! purchased it in pink and then in the blue color. it's perfect for any occasion and is very comfortable. i feel like it fits true to size and was not to revealing in the front however if i was to wear this to work it would need a cami underneath. it is not lined as well. love this dress! buy it in every color!,pos
Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!,pos
"This dress is beautiful. it may run a tad large. everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric, beautiful design and colors of the print. it will go straight into fall. so very happy i tried it! i have a beautiful, elegant dress for the hot weather.",pos
"T.la makes the best tees. soft feel, sophisticated color layering, and a body skimming shape -- all retained after multiple washings. versatile, too. other tees fade, stretch out, shrink. not t.la. a gem.",pos
"This pull over is so easy to wear, very comfortable and has a great bohemian vibe. it's quality seems higher than what i was expecting- lots of details, tassels, fringe and hood. i travel a lot for work internationally and it's become my go-to for the plane, dinners and excursions- makes a boring outfit looks effortlessly cool. would love to see more items like this pullover in the store this fall.",pos
"This gorgeous dress arrived today and i can't wait to wear it. based on other reviews i ordered a 6 petite even though i'm 5'6"" because i wanted the skirt to hit just above my knee. it's perfect. i usually wear a 4 or 6 and the 6p fits well, not snug but not big either. maybe a 6r would be larger, i don't know. if you are worried about the skirt being too long then definitely try a petite size. 

the dress is risquã© because it's faux ""see through"" but still very classy and elegant. it's sexy w",pos
"I ordered this a little big because the smallest size that they had was a medium. i probably could have gone with a small, but given that i am a 34d on top (and @ a size 2 on the bottom & @ 120lbs), the medium fits me just fine. it is super soft, and you can wear it with just about anything. keep in mind that your midriff may show a bit depending on how high your bottoms are. however, i paired it with a white pair of skinny jeans with a cute belt (so a teeny bit of my midriff was showing at time",pos
Absolutely love these. i ordered them in bronze and i'm thinking about getting the lilac pair as well. they're super comfortable and look great on.,pos
This shirt has it all. great staple piece to add to your wardrobe. not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings. found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down.,pos
This is a great sweater. it's lightweight and very comfortable. i bought a medium but really could use a small. medium still worked well though.,pos
This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.,neg
"I had high hopes with the other good reviews, but you just don't know how amazing this is until you put it on! just so soft and cozy! i am so excited for more saturday/sunday products at retailer!",pos
"I wanted to love this top. but, it looks like an ambitious 12 year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic. re: hopeful, but not good. the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on. sadly it is going back.",neg
"....that's what i look like wearing this dress. a sad, sad, sack. the fabric is less than ideal, and there is no shape to speak of. i love that it has pockets but that's about it. there was just way too much fabric for a petite person. this dress has got to be good on someone, sadly that person was not me.",neg
Love this dress! wore it last night for a musical event... came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold water...just as the label states. pulled the dress out and guess what? the design is completely faded!!! it looks 5 years old :( so sad. i'm going to call retailer and ask for a refund (i live two hours away),neg
"Beautiful neutral color in a comfortable fabric. fits tts. i am 5 ft 2 in and went with the petite. it is a midi on me. i have other skirts from retailer from past years in similar fabric and will say that overtime the waist will stretch even if hand washed carefully. so that being said, buy your size in this skirt, don't go bigger to get a longer length. you can wear it lower on your hips if you like it longer which i think actually looks more flattering. in any case, it's a great piece that no o",pos
"I bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom. absolutely loved it! i am 5""2 so the dress is part is a bit long for me---ended up wearing my 4.5 inch heels to make it fit. the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures. but that makes it more formal. it's great!",pos
So glad i finally bought this! love it!!! and have received many compliments. wore it with brown over the knee boots. one of my fave all time outfits right now.,pos
"This is so much nicer in person! wore this out today...now that it isn't too too cold. fashionable and warm. love the clasp. quite genius! i am a 36c and while i'd normally take a small, got this in medium and it fits perfectly. i'd say this piece runs slightly small for retailer.",pos
It's not a bad concept but i wished for more. i wish this tunic was a: different material as it was wrinkley and drop-waist design instead of at the waist. too bad. i wanted to love it but it will go back.,neg
"Love this romper. fits perfectly, and looks like the picture. i'm 5 ft 7, 125 lbs, and usually am a size 4 or small. i ordered a small, and it fits beautifully. i've worn this a lot this summer in florida, and am getting a lot of compliments. don't be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear- the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it.",pos
"Ordered in my normal size large and i love it. beautiful fit. striking pattern that's quite slimming. the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background. it looks black so lots of colors would work on top. the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband. it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit  high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh. i like the look but i'm 5'3"" so it works well",pos
"I bought this dress in blue. it's a light jersey material, but it is lined. i find it very flattering. i have found more occasions to wear it than i expected.",pos
My new favorite top to throw on,pos
"Ahh it's delightful! it's a little short in the fit, but it's so cute. and didn't cost an absurd amount like some more heavy weight or full trench coats. love it.",pos
This would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape. it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy. too bad!,neg
"I love this top. it is very comfortable and great to throw on with a tank and jeans for the weekend. i am curvy, and the drape of the top works well on my frame. i could see using it as a gym coverup as shown, but i like the top too much to get sweat on it :)",pos
"I love the patterns and the colors! easy to dress up or down.  i ordered a small and just ordered a can to compare them. the cut is great as the sides still meet even though there's no closure. it's a good weight for this weather and winter! i live in sweater coats where i am and this is a great addition.
it's a little itchy, that's the only flaw.",pos
Love these vegan leather pants. the fit is great for my petite frame. i bought them in regular size because the petite sold out so fast. i just got them hemmed of course. i love the fit but i also loved the color. the green was a just a little bit different and took me away from the basic black,pos
"Great material that drapes nicely. super comfy, feels cool but it's a thick material--not at all see through. so happy i purchased this. and super easy with the snap buttons, but the shirt is very well made and high-quality material. would look great on all sizes and shapes. i'm 5' 4"" and about 140, small chest. normally i'm a s or m with tops but bought this in a m because i like a slightly oversized shirt, though it's also made to be looser and longer. still, at 5' 4"" i'm not swimming in a m.",pos
"This dress is made of a wonderful, thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck",pos
"I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest.. i'm petite, 32c, 5ft and purchased the xsp in white .it is gorgeous! it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp, but i like the flowiness of this size i have so i'm keeping it. it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully. i love it! the material is gorgeous and it is well made.",pos
"Every time i turned around received another complement! it was perfect for a december wedding, great for a holiday party, and fit the bill for christmas eve. very comfortable and slimming. i'm still amazed at the number of complements received! the navy blue lace is elegant and comfortable, not scratchy like some lace. the ""v"" in back of the jumpsuit makes it easy to zip and unzip, i have some some imitations and thought i might have a problem zipping up the jumpsuit. not a problem! absolutely a",pos
"This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.",neg
I purchased this shirt in the black and it looks great. it fits well and the design with the different color dots adds character. this shirt can be worn with anything and for just about any occasion. thanks retailer for another winner!!,pos
"I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.",pos
I almost didn't try this dress. i walked by it a few times and am so glad i gave it a try! the fit is amazing. so flattering. the color and material for fall is perfect. it looks great with booties and heels.,pos
This dress looked nice online so i ordered it. once it arrived i tried it on and it looked even better. the fit was flattering as well. very versatile piece in an interesting print. glad i caught this piece on sale!,pos
"These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos, but these are far more versatile. i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens, but the stet chino can be dressed up or down. they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful. i'm 5'8"" 138 lbs, and i took my usual size 28 in these. i have full thighs, and i didn't find these to be too tight in the legs at all, but i only tried on the black/charcoal.",pos
"I&#39;m taller (5&#39;8), so it&#39;s not uncommon for things to be too short on me, but this was really short for the style.  it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size - both up top and in the wavy part below.  the style really just did not work with the length.  it looked very odd.",neg
I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance. i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket. darker color of denim with weathered edges. i absolutely love it. don't let it get away. great jean jackets are hard to come by.,pos
"I love the perfect length of these! i am 5'6"" and i love subtle capris which are very hard to find (unless i tailor them of course) but these are the perfect length and the color is great i have worn them twice and was stopped over and over again by people asking who made them. new favorite!! the waist runs a little tight but legs and tush are true to size!!",pos
"Not a coat by any means, merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn't pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated.",neg
"First, let me say that the photo does not do this exquisite print justice! the fabric is worth framing! on a white ground, the tones of rose, pink, purple and touches of blue make it even more fabulous! the fit is a tad large, as i am 5' 3"" and usually an size 6, but must size up to 8 or m because of my chest. even zipped, it is a tad big, but nothing that i cannot deal with. i don't really see the swing in the dress, as it does not flare out in any way, but is certainly is loose and flowing, bu",pos
"This is the most flattering dress i have bought in years. the fact that it's machine washable was a huge plus. fabric is so comfortable and the length is perfect! i wear either m or l and went with the large for a little extra room, but either would have fit well.",pos
"These are very nice pants. good quality and as expected. however, they do run small. i generally wear a small or size 4, sometimes a 2 depending on the maker. on average a 4. these i measured were 0 to 2 sizing. sending back and going a size up.",pos
"I tried on the xs in store, and loved it. stylist said i need xs petite, but otherwise, it looks great. the cut is flattering, the neckline is a tad higher and almost has a mini cowl. the colors are neutral and would love to wear with a nice pair of dark flared pants. or skinnies. so at 115 lbs, 30dd, i would go with xs petite( i am below 5'2""). fabric is very soft too...",pos
I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic. i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well. it was not flattering because it was so boxy.,neg
"This has lovely embroidery of good quality, and it is nicely lined in the embroidered section too. it is a very loose swingy shape, so size down.",pos
I would describe as an upgraded t-shirt. a perfect flowy top that you can dress up or down. comfortable and soft material.,pos
"I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit, but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!",pos
I love the details that this cardigan has. try it!,pos
"When i saw this shirt it bought back wonderful memories of ice skating on wheatley's pond as a child where i primarily grew up in the northeast. just loved it!! i tried my normal size 4 on but it fell off my shoulders and the cuffs fell mid hand so, i tried the size 2 and it fit perfectly. i see where many say it runs small and for full busted ladies it may but i am only 34b and 116 lbs and the size 2 worked fine. it is slightly blousey in the mid section but not overly so, the fabric and stitch",pos
"This is an understated elegant denim dress. the fabric color is just the right fade and thickness (not too thin and not too thick) which is appropriate for most occasions. it?s very soft and can get a bit wrinkly but nothing major. my local retailer has only the regular size and it's true to size, size 6 (my usual size for holding horses brand) fit well around the bust and waist area (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips; busty gals may want to size up). this dress shows cleavage so if you?re conscious like",pos
"I've been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews, i decided to get the dress. the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it. however, i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm, which make it impossible for me to raise my arms.

i ordered size petite xxs",neg
"I love this dress. the fabric is butter soft, the strapless top stays in place and it hangs beautifully. it is such a wonderfully comfortable summer dress. as previously stated, i'm in love.",pos
"I am absolutely in love with this bathing suit and i want it in every color possible! i bought the black one last year and wore it all summer as no other suit that i already owned could compare. i get compliments on it every where i go. it's flattering, comfy and it's a one piece that doesn't make me feel frumpy. buy this suit!",pos
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.,neg
"This dress is super soft and really flattering. i'm 5'2"" and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me, but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. it's one i've been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. it's great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights.",pos
"I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!",pos
"This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,",pos
"I absolutely adore peplum tops, although some of them are made for individuals with short torsos. this one is beautifully designed with a long torso and flowing wrists. there is a nice balance between the fitted torso and then the flowing peplum and sleeves. the best thing of all is the fabric, which is a stretchy mid-weight jacquard. it is easy to get on, with a zipper in the back. i am sure i will get a lot of use out of this as the weather turns cooler and i plan on pairing it with pencil ski",pos
"It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy, still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom, wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!",pos
"Love this dress!  it has a nice stretchy weight to it and is texturally interesting. it's the first retailer piece that i ever bought my teenage daughter and she looks so sophisticated in it, like a young lady. it's both classy and youthful!  for reference, she's 5'5 100# and is wearing a 00.",pos
"I am an hourglass figure with a d cup. i rarely wear trapeze tops, as they make me appear larger. this is a very lovely top! fits nice (i was a medium) and hits nicely around hips (i'm 5'4). perfect for a special night out.",pos
These tights are perfect. they seem like they will last a couple seasons with minimal wear. just the slightest texture and not shiny. i got the beige/brown to layer with dresses/skirts and boots. love.,pos
I love these pants so much i had to write a review! purchased the carbon color recently in regular length - the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me. size was also tts (typically wear size 2 and got 26). i've been wearing them often! they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely. i've been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season --- i also think the quality is much better. i will be getting them in more colors,pos
"I saw this piece and fell in love with it. the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece! it is a little boxy, and is a bit warm for indoors, but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws. i am 5'10"". usually a small, but sized up to a medium with this one.",pos
Love the detailing around the neck of this top looks great under cardigan or by itself. i sized down to an xs. seems to be of good quality although to lengthen its life i don't plan on putting it in the dryer :),pos
This skirt is nicer in person. the fit is a little strange. the waist is tts but rest of the skirt runs a size large. i am a curvy size 8 and purchased the 6 based on another review. the waist is a tad snug but overall the skirt fits. it's too beautiful to return.,pos
"I really love this dress! the fit is flattering and comfortable. the fabric has a pale art nouveau background, with indian and middle eastern prints over it. the beadwork does ""really pop,"" and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. for lovers of etro's bohemian style who don't want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress . . .",pos
I've been a fan of the pilcro chinos for years but the jeans have not been the right fit for me - usually wind up too big in the waist to accommodate the hips. well the em is aptly named as they are made to fit a girl! ! i usually wear a 29 and the 29 fit comfortably and i could probably even go down a size. thank you retailer - please make more in this style!,pos
"Gorgeous colors, high quality. my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight. if you have a large chest (c+) this is going to be snug, or not fit at all. i'm wearing it now in pregnancy, but i think it will also look great post-partum. can be dressed up or down.",pos
Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!,pos
"I ordered both the petite and regular in the olive green motif. the regular fit more as i was hoping so i returned the petite.
i am only 5' 4"" but my legs are long for my height. i wasn't ready to have the side slits ""up to here"" and whereas they are not they are still quite high it is modest enough to be worn any place i might wear the dress. i think i will likely wear a belt with it as shown at least part of the time. i just bought some print fabric sling back shoes which go beautifully with",pos
"Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5'2"" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton.",pos
"Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.
and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty""",neg
"I am 5'3' and 120 lbs for reference, and pear shaped and this dress in a 4 petite fit like a glove. granted, not a dress i would want to gain weight in, but fit perfectly. usually i am a 2 in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice. it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am.",pos
"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.",neg
I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.,pos
"This 1960s aprã¨s-ski style sweater is made of an amazingly soft pure wool in a color that is a touch brighter and maybe even a bit more coral pink than the online photo looks to me. there is a large button under the collar that shows if you stand it up. seems to be of a very high quality, comparable to vintage hand-knit sweaters.

it is very chunky and warm, and i would recommend taking a size up for a looser fit. i'm 5'2"", 33-25-37, narrow shoulders, and otth the xs and s fit me well, running",pos
Love this shirt. it's easy to throw on and makes a cute outfit with about any kind of bottoms. i've wore it with leggings and jeans.,pos
"This dress references that it is off the shoulder in the description. but i did not find it to be so; it fits me as pictured on the model - sort of a ballet neck or wide scoop neck. in any case, the fabric is as pictured. and - it's lined! yay - not see through. the varying sizes of stripes give it interest despite the neutral colors. it is cute with a denim jacket and is really comfortable.",pos
"These pajama pants are dreamy in all ways! incredibly soft, with a soft and not binding elastic waist. plus, the print is evocative.

i am 5'8"" and a size 2/4. i bought these in the store. the only size left was one pair of xs. sure enough they fit.

the length is perfect. 

i just ordered a pair for my sister.",pos
"I love this dress. it is a fun and flirty summer dress. i think it can be dressed up or worn casually. i am a 36c, 29"" waist, 40"" hips. i bought a size 8 and it fits me great. as others said, it is a little snug across the chest, but i think it is supposed to be. with the proper bra it fits very comfortably! i am going to wear it for mother's day brunch!",pos
"I wore this tunic everyday on vacation in hawaii. runs a little small, i'm usually a small and the x-small was just right. perfect length, short but not too short.",pos
I could live in these. they are so comfy. i typically wear a 6 and got the medium. they are a little roomy. probably could have gotten a small..but i like them kinda loose and baggy. i will probably purchase another color!,pos
"I love this dress-i have it in the other color (black and white) but now i see this color scheme and i think i may actually like this one better. i love the wider stripes near the waistline which gives it a slimming appearance. the knotted look gives this dress a beachy feel which gets me in the mood for summertime. i love that the pattern is bold, but the color scheme allows this dress to still stay in the casual category and still be insanely flattering. i love that i could wear this dress eve",pos
"This tee is my favorite this year! it just looks great on! not fitted, but not loose either. i love it so much i have it in white, black, pink, light green, gray, slate blue and holly. the holly was my least favorite color (i thought it would look a little 'greener') it is so dark, you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green. i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just because...

"I bought this dress as a consolation prize when another dress i wanted didn't suit me. i was shocked by how flattering it was, because on the hanger it was just ""meh"". the material is soft jersey, heathered, and it hangs well. it has a simple lining, but that doesn't interfere with the fit. it is a little low for my personal taste, so i wear a cami or scarf, but for those less well endowed, you'd probably be fine without one. for the record, i typically wear a 2-4, 125 pounds, 5'8, and 32 ddd br",pos
"So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about, but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point (and intent) at retailer, so i had hopes. i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days, but it's honestly so thin i couldn't even see it working that well for that. it's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti",neg
"I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but, i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately, it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal",pos
"Got this in the white and it fits perfectly. just the right length and enough detail on the shoulders. i'm 5'6"" and 120 (usually an xxs or xs for tops) and the xs fits just right, not too loose not too tight. i like the style since it emphasizes my shoulders and balances nicely with cropped jeans (i'm pear shaped). material is slightly clingy but it adds to the drape nicely (wouldn't work well if it was fitted, but it's not).",pos
"This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out, and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person. 

very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping.",neg
"I looked at this top online & thought abt wearing w/ shorts (later) & saw that it's cotton which i love. decided to order my usual size small in the black & the moss. arrived yesterday... happened to have on a pair of leggings & tried on the tops. wow, really cute w/ leggings... looks like i can wear w/ skinnys, shorts, or leggings so i'm happy w/ that. may even go w/ a skirt or slacks.
the cap sleeves are cute & the top flares some but not over-whelming or maternity-like. plenty of room on my s",pos
"Great design & execution - this is essentially a striped jersey sleeveless turtleneck, made of a nice, high-quality jersey. with a delicate lightweight soft sweater attached over it. so you get this really pretty look where the jersey underlay means the sweater hangs beautifully, no clinging at all. and the sleeves are just the sheer sweater - so pretty.

i got the lavender - looks exactly like the pic. and it is true to size.",pos
"I bought this top in a large. i washed it in cold water, and it shrank just enough to flatter. the material is great, in that when i washed it, the blouse hanged quite nicely, no ironing needed. also, the material is heavy enough that no tank is needed underneath the top. thakoon had made the same top last summer, and it had cost around $500. this top is even better due to the material, and i could buy it for a fraction of the price. highly recommend!",pos
Just got this yesterday and i'm wearing it today! super comfy for running errands with the kids and going to and from the gym...or just to lounge around the house. i go between a m and l and went with a m since its flowy and it fits great.,pos

"You want to buy this! it's so comfy and stylish, yet casual. the sale price is amazing. if anything, the arms of the coat are a bit thin compared to the body of the coat. overall, it fits well though. i ordered an xs. i almost want to order the other color i love it so much. i will probably wear this year round but it will be especially cute in autumn!",pos
"This is the perfect casual yet stylish dress. and, it's extremely comfortable!",pos
"I love, love, love this sweater.  it is slightly fitted so that is drapes beautifully.  notice it has 3/4 length sleeves which is fine for north caroline where it does not really get cold.  i purchased the blue and i wore it with fitted jeans.",pos

I love this dress. i think it will be awesome to wear this summer but also a great transition piece into fall. very boho!,pos
"As soon as i saw this dress, i absolutely fell in love with it. when i got it, i noticed it was slightly small, but figured i could deal with it. i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back. i could fix it, but honestly a dress shouldn't start falling apart before you even wear it. it's cut on the small side. wish i tried the larger one, but now it's sold out. and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured. i",neg

Love this pullover for its versatile style (can be buttoned or unbuttoned) and easy care look. it's casual without looking sloppy. the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage. the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl. the hem is straighter. soft nubbly texture that may snag easily. got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too.,pos

I am wearing these as i type this. they are unbelievably cozy. would wear them as loungewear if it weren't for the fact that they also look so so cute and i want to wear them out. so soft and a really good fit. higher than my other leggings so i don't have to pull them up ever. but also just really fashionable looking. love!!! one of my favorite retailer purchases ever.,pos

"This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however, like a previous reviewer, the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted, without all the excess fabric at the bottom, it would have been perfect. again, the color, the lace, the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came",neg

I love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors. i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly. the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability. the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting. i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back. it's an absolute staple in my wardrobe now.,pos

Cute tunic.  fits on the fitted side but i love it with a vest layered over. nice material.,pos
"I cannot say enough about these pajama pants. they're beautiful and crazy comfortable. it's a nice change from black or grey. i also love that there are no pockets because i hate how they jut out on me. i wanted a petite l because i am short, but the regular large is fine. i just wear them higher up on my hips. i normally wait for sales on sleepwear, but i couldn't resist on these. they're well worth the investment!",pos
"I tried this on in the store and came online for the petite size. the length was fine on me, it's only the sleeves that would be better for me in petite. this cardigan is very cute. the dots are a bit more arty-looking in ""person"" than you can see here - more like watercolor or ink spots, which is a nice subtle touch. i put ""runs small"" just because i think you might want to size up if you plan on wearing much in the way of layers underneath. the merino wool is not itchy, it is nice and soft. i",pos
"I love the idea of this top, but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back, the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric, i wo",neg
"Love this shirt so much. it is comfortable and a beautiful print. i sized down because it is very flowy! it is ivory instead of white, but still looks beautiful. one of my favorite tops.",pos
"I love ag jeans. these jeans fit snug but not confining. they have some stretch to the material so that you can move with ease. i love the way they fit my body with one exception. unfortunately they did not have the petite available so the length is about 3 to 4 inches too long on my 5'3 frame. the dark blue makes it acceptable for casual friday (yay). i am 5'3 102lbs and even though i will have to hem them, the overall fit was great!",pos
"Love the material (more natural fiber than synthetic), the pattern, and the colors. also, it is cozy! the one con is that it is really big and crazy-long. so long, that it may be a show-stopper. on the fence about that.",pos
Love this piece. it is warm and attractive and will set any outfit off from a dress to jeans and a t-shirt. i look forward to wearing it often.,pos
This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!,pos
"I really love this top! it is soft, lightweight, and really pretty. it has quickly become one of my favorites!",pos
"This dress is a home run on all accounts. the embroidery is gorgeous, the fabric is high-quality, and the a-line cut is slimming. i found this dress to run true to size. i am 5'11"" and the length hits above the  knee--so it could be longer on shorter heights. i purchased the white dress initially and now have also ordered the navy.",pos
"The color of this dress is sublime. so is the fit. ruching in all the right places. made me feel glamorous. it's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat, vest, or cropped jacket. the material feels so nice against the skin too. it's a must have.",pos
This top is great for those days when you have nothing to wear. just throw this on and get ready for the compliments!,pos
"It is such a pretty dress. the pics don't do this dress any justice. the cut and style is so flattering. the colors are gorgeous. you can wear it on a cool evening in summer and well into fall. i absolutely love this dress. even if the material appears a bit rough, there is a slip underneath.",pos
"Comfy, casual, and stylish! i received many compliments on this shirt. it drapes across your body very nicely and does not cling. it has a great asymmetrical cut that is very flattering. the material is comfortable and the color is warm and summer-like.",pos
This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!,neg
"I am a 32dd, 5'4'' and 125lbs and this top was way too baggy. it looked awful. this is shapeless and oversized. i would size down or just pass.",neg
This is a beautiful dress and fits well. the embroidery is delicate and can snag easily.,pos
"This is my first romper and i am in love.  so comfortable and easily dressed up or down.  i am usually an xs, small, or petite small in retailer brands.  the xs worked best for me.  the petite small was too big.  i am 5'2"" and the length of the xs is perfect ankle length.  i was nervous to put it in the washer on delicate cycle but it came out perfectly.",pos
"Everything about this top is perfect! quality is great which is number one in my book. color is awesome! perfect color for fall, summer and spring! a must have!!",pos
"I love this dress (i bought the navy with white stripes). it is comfortable, flattering, and versatile. best of all, i received a complement from my husband, who never comments on my clothing! the drapey knit fabric fits closely (but not tightly) in the shoulders and bust and then skims over the lower body. the fabric is soft and stretchy, not too thick, but still substantial enough that i did not need to wear support garments underneath (i am 5'4"", 123 lbs). i wore this to a christmas party and",pos
"I like these jeans. when i wore them, i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size, but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on, but as you wear them, they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile, my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi",pos
I love this shirt. i bought it in both black and white and i get compliments every time i wear it. i totally recommend this top! it's a great material and easy to wear with a lot of different bottoms.,pos
"Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's ""effortless"" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big.",pos
"I tried this shirt in the purple motif, it fit true to size, my normal small worked well. all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in. really? on a white shirt? it annoyed me so much i didn't buy the shirt.",neg
"Perfect top! i love the mix of materials, silky in the front and comfy knit in the back. the tie on the side is adorable and adds a little something special to the shirt. happy!",pos
If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look,neg
"I originally bought this in a petite xs. i am 5' 4"" tall on a good day. sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me. but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms. i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves, the overall look is much better. i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too. will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio. looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think. a winner!",pos
Wide fit. usually an 8-10 at retailer. got a large for online order and was large for sure - great for summer or winter with long sleeve and tights,pos
"This dress looked gorgeous, light and lacy in the picture, but when it arrived, the ""lace"" that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive. the inner sheath was made of a heavy, sequined material. it was uncomfortable, scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail. it also added bulk to the dress, so that i looked ten pounds heavier. i can't imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip. the si",neg
Saw this in the store yesterday and had my daughter try it on. it was really cute on her and she loved it. in fairness to the other reviewers she tried on a size 0 which was perfect for her petite frame and i can see how this blouse would run really big in the larger sizes. but the fabric and detail is so pretty and it was on sale.,pos
I love these pjs! the sale price finally made the set affordable and i could not be happier! so soft and comfy!,pos
"After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted. so i took a chance and ordered a regular size 2. i am 5'1 115lbs, so i typically order a petite 2. received this today and am very happy i made that choice. the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees. the fabric is perfect for winter. i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box - it was very heavy. the lace",pos
"This blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great. silk is always light, and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt. i'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks.",pos
"Love! the detailing is so pretty! and finally!!! it's a top that's comfortably long. retailer has been making all of their tops so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and a dd. i ordered a large simply because it's a cotton tee and i didn't want a fitted look, per se. my only criticism would be that the material is a little thin in the front. i just ordered it in black too!",pos
"This coat is a classic! i would wear it every day if it wasn't so distinct. very comfortable, flattering, and stylish.",pos
Absolutely love this sweater! it is a tad bit large. i bought it in a medium but because i like the loose fit i will keep it. it is very light and great for the summer. i've only worn it once so far and received many compliments on it. great quality as well!,pos
"I love this dress. it is exactly my style, which is probably why i love it: girly, frilly, flowy... i love how much material it has. it flows and twirls in such a nice way because of the amount of fabric. it's the right length that the amount of material is not overwhelming - i'm 5'5"" and it hits just above my knees. i am currently 6 months pregnant, and it's plenty roomy to fit now, and will also mask the post-baby belly this summer. the only 2 cons, and the other reviewers touched on these as",pos
Great fabric. soft and easy to wear and goes from day to night easily.,pos
"I usually wear a 4, but ordered a 2 & 0 because of the previous reviews. the 2 fit perfectly. the 0 was too snug across the shoulders. both sizes were the same length and width except the shoulders.the material is beautiful and seems very well made. i am thrilled with this purchase.it looks exactly like the photo.",pos
I loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues. same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that doesn't wrinkle. i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt. will wear often.,pos
I love this sweater tunic! the neckline adds interest and is so flattering. i think it is more flattering in person than in the photos of the model. my husband even noticed the neckline and said he loves this top on me :) it is soft and not itchy at all. i bought my regular size small and will wear it with jeans or leggings and boots. i love that this neckline comes up a bit but is not huge so i can definitely pair a scarf with it for a change if i wanted to. this will definitely be a staple in,pos
They are as comfortable as sweat pants. i can wear these all day and then some and be comfy. i love the fit (skinny's can be hard for me - i have athletic thighs) and the length is fantastic. i want more pairs in different washes!!,pos
"I had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long (they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size. i love it! it is a little long in the back, but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt. so cute with skinny jeans and leggings! it is one of my favorite fall tops! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays!",pos
Great casual pant for the summer. wish there were more colors. white or beige would be great. comfortable. great fit. sizing is consistent with my normal designer denim sizing; 26. i'm also 5'3 and the regular size pant is just right for me.,pos
"This sweater came in just as expected . . . adorable. as others have said, it is soft and comfy. i will wear it everywhere (including work). i love it! :)",pos
"Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3'', 118lbs, and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!",pos
"Just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it. the true color is a little darker, i would call it a taupe. the fabric is really nice. i am a 34 c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences, and they run small. the medium is perfect for my size. i usually order a small panty, and this one fits, it looks smaller than pictured on the model. this set is one of a kind, the pattern on fabric is really beautiful. i think it is worth the price. if you like lingerie,",pos
"After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls, but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.",pos
"This sweet dress is perfect for fall and spring because the knit is not too thick, the drape allows layers and the colors are very versatile.  the style is loose if you stay tts but will be a slimmer fit if you size down.  if your body habitus is super slender, definitely size down.  the liner slip is soft and the back side of the knit is a bit scratchy.  i think this dress is beautiful and best of all, forgiving.  i'm happy to have tried both colors--the problem is picking which one to keep!  m",pos
"I was so excited to try this on in the store, because i've had my eye on it online. unfortunately, it is not like the picture. the material is very thin, almost translucent. i also could not figure out how it get it on! the cape has short sleeves, not long, as it appears in the picture, and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front. love the look of black design on white. hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall, but for now, i'll skip this one.",neg
The dress looks even better in person. the fabric is very delicate though but worth the extra care it needs. the fit was perfect and the color is just as in the picture.,pos
These are the perfect tights-fit and feel are top quality and they wash well!,pos
"I wanted to love this dress - and did from the picture online. when it arrived, the black already looked faded and old. also, the embroidery looks like a grandma, but not in a cute vintage way. the fabric is stiff, which causes a boxy, unflattering look. had to return it.",neg
I love the print on these pants. they are beautifully flowy and flattering. the only downside is that they are see through so i'm going to take them to tailor to have a lining put in up to the knee so i can wear them to places other than the beach. i bought them on sale today in the store and bought a size small.,pos
My favorite jeans i have ever purchased! they fit just right. i wear them everywhere.,pos
This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print. the details are to die for. the blue is not the same as the picture. slightly darker and more muted.,pos

"I bought this sweater on a whim in the store, without trying it on. when i got home, i decided it would probably lose it's shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it. a few days later, desperate for something to wear, i grabbed it and decided to keep it - merely to have something to wear that day. i'm so glad i did.

Ii'm not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it. looks good dressed up w/a nice top or casual w/a tee. can be worn practically all year. love it!,pos
"This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to",pos
"This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top, but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6"" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.
i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.
a great staple for your closet.",pos
"This dress is beautiful on! it is flowy and loose but is cut well so it avoids looking like a tent. white dresses with lace can run the risk of being a bit fussy-- the lace at the bottom is a beautiful detail without being too precious and the handkerchief bottom keeps it interesting. can be styled so many ways-- looks great with a cropped denim jacket, belted, or loose with a long necklace. also tried with a sleeveless long sweater vest and it was adorable. the dress is fully lined and feels su",pos
This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.,neg
"I found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress. it is prettier in person. i have the ivory and black print. i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly. i might wear a different slip, however i was able to get the slip to stay in place. the print and fabric are a nice quality. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p. i bought this in the 0 regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer. i think it runs just a little bit small.",pos
"This dress is the perfect combo of flattering, comfort, and quality. i purchased the turquoise color, which is vibrant! this will be my go to dress for spring. the material is super soft, flowy and medium weight. i ordered petite s, probably could have got xs. i love, love, love this dress!",pos
"The pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on, i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love. i'm a 36c/d and normally wear an 8 or 10 and bought this in a large. the front buttons don't peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops. i'm actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts. the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns, too :)",pos
"I was in search of a few sweaters that were functional for the winter, but also fit my style. i will have to wear a camisole underneath, but i love the feel and the fit! i always have a problem finding sleeves that are long enough. the sleeves are an appropriate length.",pos

"I first tried this dress in my usual size 4, and thought it was a pretty fabric but boring and not particularly flattering.  i later read the positive reviews and the next time i was in the store i tried it in a 2, and it was so much better!  very pretty shape.  uiu might want to size down because the shoulders were set a little wide apart and bodice was gapping in my usual size.  for reference, i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs.",pos
This dress is like a piece of art. absolutely beautiful on. i wore it to a charity event and received several compliments. it's just so gorgeously different!,pos

"Unique print but not great execution. the pant legs are very tight, i have average sized calves and i sized up one size. the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp. when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color. too bad this didn't work out.",neg
"I am so pleased with my purchase. the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique. the attached matching, adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add. neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso. i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful, i am 5'7"", 133, and a 36a. 
if you have been considering this dress, don't delay, especially at the wonderful sale price!",pos

Much softer fabric than i expected. wrinkles easily.,pos
"I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe. i did not like the fit of the fish print, but the stripe is perfect--so try more than one color if you are interested in this style. also try more than one size of course. i almost always order up in a swimsuit, and this time was no different. the medium fit great, although i am a xs-s according to the size guide. i am a 34b for reference, but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide. i do not like to feel constricted, but i still want the top to",pos

"Although i find $150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater, buy it. i bought a size medium which fits me exactly. it is an off-white, which is what i wanted. i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt, for the ""sweater dress"" look. it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket.",pos
"This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7"" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it.",pos

I loved the color and style then put them on and didn't take them off! they are so comfortable cane believe it. they are going to be my fall staple,pos

"Really, this top feels like a wonderfully expensive soft silk knit. it is just so very soft. the drape is really nice and there is stretch to it, making it very comfortable. it does have a tendency to fall towards the body, even though it's loose. so, i'd buy your regular size.

"I'll admit that i often believe you pay for the design aesthetics at retailer, but not necessarily the quality. however, this dress happily has both! the fabrication and lacework on this dress are beautifully made and the price tag fits. i do think the sizing is off; i'm 5'5"", 137, 34b and the medium (my usual size) was huge, small was still gaping under the arms, and xs fit perfectly. i haven't worn an xs in anything since middle school, ha! the banding at the bust does make it tight, so i can we",pos
"I love these pants! first, they are super flattering. for a new mom, the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second, they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats, boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i didn't want to say that they ran large, because they aren't too loose.",pos
"This is a beautiful dress. however, it looked awful on me. i ordered the medium and it was huge. also, i looked 7 months pregnant. not a good style for the short person.",neg
"What can i say? it's like wearing a hug. it's so wonderful i have a hard time taking it off at the end of the day! it's extraordinarily soft and thick, and stylish to boot! the one thing is that the thread holding the pockets together was already coming unraveled when i took it out of the package, and i had to sew them back on right away, as they were starting to come completely apart. a small price to pay for being a new owner of the best thing ever.",pos
I absolutely love this top! ordered the moss color in size xxs. i am 5'5 105 lbs. i typically wear xs and 0 in retailer clothing. this top is kinda flared/loose fitting so i would size down. the website currently says it's by everleigh but the tag says eri & ali. color is a little darker in person but tie dye effect is spot on. it's beautiful! and super super comfy! i am currently wearing it with my lululemons! but can defin see this top being dressed up with a cute pendant necklace and skinny bla,pos
"I'm small--5'1"" and 90 lbs--and the petite xxs fits really well. the fabric feels soft, too. i can't wait for warmer weather so i can wear this.",pos
"This top is gorgeous in person! i got the small because at 5'5"", 127 pounds and a 30f chest, you never know how a top will fit. however, this one is big. i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out. i'll be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and there's a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse. love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it!",pos
"This lovely number met all my expectations. ordered an xl, and glad i did. the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out. if it was available in another classic color, or a subtle neutral pattern i'd probably purchase a second one (hint hint retailer).",pos
"I love this dress. it's a lightweight soft fabric. the blue layer is a bit thin, so you can see the stripped layer underneath which keeps this from being just an ordinary blue dress. usually i'm a size 0xs but got a 2 because i was worried it would be too tight in the shoulders (based on another similar dress from holding horses). the two fits great, the top and waist fit perfect and the bottom is nice and flowy without being too much fabric.",pos
"I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it. it came out of the wash (delicate/cold cycle) with 3 small holes. i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer. it is flattering, lightweight, gorgeous color, cool raw edges, v-back detail...i could go on and on about all the things i love about this top, but now it has holes after one washing so it's all for naught. do-over please with better fabric qa.",neg
"Super soft shorts. i ordered them in the orange and it's a lovely soft orange. they aren't too short, about mid thigh. i found the 27 to be a little loose on the waist but i was afraid to compromise the length for a size 26. i may order the navy in 26.",pos
"This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailer's aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silk/jacquard fabric to give it texture, which is how it looks from the photo. obviously it would have been more expensive, but in any case, this was just a really expensive polyester dress, which it says in the product description, but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt, thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product, it'll be retailer. but now i",neg
"This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!",pos
"The sweater looked different on each model so i wasn't sure what to expect. luckily, it fitted me similar to the one i was hoping it would, the cream sweater model. i'm 5'6"" and got a size small. i like that it hangs just past my hips and the long sleeves. also, the v-neck isn't too low so i don't have to wear a camisole.it's very cozy and doesn't itch.",pos
Swing dresses can be so iffy but this one is fantastic! i sized down to an xs due to the chest area (i'm usually a s/6 up top 36b) and it fits perfectly. the dress is so comfortable and stylish without feeling like you're wearing a tent. this is the most i've ever spent on a casual dress and it is worth ever penny. could not be more happy with my purchase.,pos
"Mine was slightly tight across the bust area, but i'm able to leave it open with a light tank underneath. it still looks great!",pos
"This is a beautiful shirt. i purchased the top in navy, the silver touch is pretty. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and m was perfect, tts. great for work or casual party.",pos
"I ordered this in a size s, my usual size and it fits great. i love the color, style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of, ever so slightly, poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color, i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!",pos
"This dress is to die for. it's exactly as pictured, beautiful quality and extremely flattering. all the lace and lining make it a slightly heavier dress - i can imagine it getting really warm after a while in the summer sun. but it would absolutely be worth the bit of sweat to wear this gorgeous dress.",pos
This tunic is a wonderfully updated look. it's cinched just a tad at the waist which gives it a great line. i paired it with a pair of citizens of humanity crop jeans. terrific look!!,pos
"This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way. 

i am 5'6"" 135 lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the 4 and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a 2 but now they are sold",pos
"I bought the dress that has the cream skirt with large flowers. i wore it for a wedding and was not only very comfortable with the pockets and the cotton top, i looked good. i got a lot of compliments on the outfit. people thought it was a shirt and blouse rather than a dress. i loved the high low skirt. the sizing was accurate and the dress is easy to clean.",pos
"This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops, sandals, wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress.",pos
"This outfit was online for months with no review so i was skeptical to order but very glad i did as it is better in person. 
it is beautiful, high quality tommy bahama inspired suit. i am 55 so short shorts are risky even though i am a typical size 4 or 6. i took a 4 in the blazer and i am typically a high 4 or low 6 in size so i would say the blazer is very true to size. i took the size 8 in the shorts as i felt they ran small and i wanted the extra length. they ride a bit lower on my waist an",pos
"My absolute favorite dress yet from retailer! i wore it to numerous events this past summer and felt like $1,000,000.! glad it's on sale now for others to snatch up.",pos
"I have the blue version. i love the bold, pop art pattern. the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top.",pos
"I fell in love the first time i saw it. the xs is the perfect fit. i generally wear xs/s or 2 in dresses. its not too snug to wear over a thin to medium thickness sweater. its a good length also, not too long, which i struggle with given my height of 5'3. the s was overall too big. its not itchy, though i've only worn it with long sleeve tops. its just the right weight. not too thin and not too heavy. its feminine and fun. wonderful topper for jeans, pants, or a dress. the color is versatile. sl",pos
Such an amazing shirt to dress down for a long day at school,pos
"These are such quirky pants! they're a lot of fun, well made and i love the wide, cropped legs. they do run small - though most reviewers say they are true to size. i wear a 4/6 or 28, and in these i had to get a size 10. very tight at the waist, even though the rest of the pant flows easily and is loose. great color, they'll be perfect for spring and fall, and you can probably pair with boots in the winter. just a fun staple to my wardrobe.",pos
I'm 7months preggars and this top actually compliments my belly. extremely comfortable.,pos
"Absolutely gorgeous.  i never have been a yellow person but today i am converted.  all the colors are vibrant and true to the photo. i'm 5'6 and the length is perfect for flat sandals and my wedges, so i can dress it up or be stunningly casual.  i range from 14-16/ l-xl in retailer dresses.  the size is dictated by my broad shoulders. since this one is sleeveless i went with the large and it's perfect.  the nude slip has clasps to keep the straps in place and its adjustable. the slip is als",pos
I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear,pos
"I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder, loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.",pos
"I bought this during the 25% off dress sale, but alas it is a chemise and not a dress. nevertheless i love it. in a smaller size (i exchanged an xs for an xxs) it is much more flattering and has more shape. the different fabrics make it interesting and fun.",pos
"These pants have quickly become my go to spring pant. comfortable and a long enough crop for my 5'8 legs, almost closer to the ankle which i prefer. i wore them 3 times with out washing and they did stretch out a bit but there is a set of buttons in the hip if i really needed them tighter there. i bought the darker color, its a mossy green/grey. it looks sharp with the tla black v-neck t shirt.",pos
"Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too, but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger.",pos
"Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size. i am either a large or xl. i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size. first, the top is huge. i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely. the rest of the top was like a large tent. the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking. in fact, in the store, it was displayed with a jacket over it. online, the orange looks completely different,",neg
"I love this sweater. it's sort of like a tunic and sort of like a vest. i am pairing it with leggings and a white long sleeve tee underneath. i'm 5'3"" 109 lbs and the xs fit very well. i love the versatility and design of this.",pos
"I'm so happy i decided to take a chance and order this top. it is gorgeous! so flattering on, the perfect length, beautiful colors. i could go on and on. peplums can be tough but this one hits perfectly on me. runs true to retailer sizing so stick with what you normally order. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb and the s was for me.",pos
"Bypassed this blouse online, but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy, it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans..",pos
The color is deep coral and perfect for fall to top jeans or leggings. i love the big slouchy look so the drapey quality is a plus.,pos
Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!,pos
"I bought this dress to wear at a bridal shower and absolutely love it! the color was perfect and the petite-xs was true to its size. the top was a bit on the tight side with my arms but overall incredibly comfortable. i would buy more in this style and size, but not having enough occasions to wear the style. it's great for wedding guests, cocktail hours, or even work.",pos
"These are fabulous pants.  they can easily  be worn to work.  best jeans/pants ever for women with no butts!!  they stay up, and they're comfortable. 
i can't  speak highly enough for these.  don't  ever stop  making them, retailer!!",pos
This skirt is so cute. the fix print is really nice. it's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe.,pos
"I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color. just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work. unfortunately, it is poorly made. i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart. after closely inspecting the cause, i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together, so the minute you put it on, one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect. it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f",neg
Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks... makes a great and comfortable work outfit.,pos
"Great style and fit. will look great with jeans, skirt or leggings!",pos
"When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.
i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy.",pos
"Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei silky pull on pants. i got hooked on them last summer and was thrilled to see them for the upcoming spring. they run true to size. they are beyond comfortable and wear well. everyone should have at least one pair of these comfy pants in their closet. dress them up, down or wear them to the office. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for.",pos
"I love this dress?sophisticated and amazing?fabulous fabric. however, if you are petite and take a 0, it will be enormous! i am trying to decide if i send it back or have it altered.",pos
"I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.
it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.
the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size.",pos
"So comfy and stylish. love the color, i purchased the indigo/blue. nice fit, relaxed fit....not fitted. might have to get another color. it's fun to have a tee with a different design detail (neckline). i'm 5'7 145-150 lbs and ordered the medium. a smaill probably would have worked too, since my shoulders are a bit narrow. but mediumd is fine:)",pos
"I walked into a hair salon wearing this dress, and everyone who walked by complimented me. to me, that's a definite winner! i got the blue color, and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively. the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus. this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should. there's no static or clinging where there shouldn't be. i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off, but i absolutely love it.",pos
This coat is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is soft and almost silky and the style is timeless. i ordered an xs and it fits true to size and has excellent quality.,pos
"I love that this tee is so soft and is not boring! when i originally took it out of the bag, my teenage daughter did not like it. then i tried it on and she was wowed! the longer length in the back makes it very interesting. i am looking forward to wearing this with jeans.",pos
"How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know, i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this, paired with a darker color (and not black, yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple, it is a dark color which is slimming, but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo",pos
"In accordance with other reviewers, the pictures don't do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice; the fabric has threads of gold, silver, and black that together make for shimmery elegance--not at all the heather grey in the photo.. i'm 5' 8"" 120 34b and the xs (regular) fits perfect--and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo. sleeves are long--which i love. a keeper, especially on sale!",pos
"I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3"" 112 lbs and the small",pos
"Have been on the hunt for decent shorts all summer. as an elder, i need some length, comfort, style and attractive fit. these meet all the criteria. i'm 5'3"" and got the 31's. they're lightweight but substantial enough to keep their shape. love the faux cuff too. they stretched a bit but still have a perfect fit. got the grey on sale and getting 2 more in other colors left in my size at full price. so good!",pos
"I absolutely love this dress! when i wear it i feel so graceful and pretty. the belt allows you to tie it so that if your weight fluctuates up or down, it still looks great. i think i'm going to be wearing this dress all summer. love, love, love. 

i think my only quibble would be that the lining on the inside fits more snugly than the dress itself, and when i was walking it rode up (it's like a stretchy mesh type material). but i'm carrying a few more pounds than i'd like right now. once i lo",pos
"I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big - i wear an 8 in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine - this one does not even zip up. i might exchange for bigger size, as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent - or it may just go back.",neg
"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around, the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely, you can see the model's black underwear.",neg
I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.,neg

"Ordered the grey colored capris & they fit great. i am 5'5 110lbs and the size 25 fits me comfortably. i've recently been making a transition into more comfortable, looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans. these are great. still figure flattering, but comfortable and well made. the detail on the button section is lovely also.",pos
"Beautiful dress!! i love this and am tempted to buy it in more colors. fits true to size, in a flattering way. love the cut of the back and the flow of the bottom.",pos
"I love this tunic. the fit is just lovely for me--i'm a large busted, muscular shouldered woman who wears a 4-6 on the bottom. the 8 fit perfectly across my chest (34ddd) without horrid, gaping armpits. and the gathered back gives just enough extra fabric so that the buttons do not pull at all in front--not easy to achieve in a button down for a big chested girl! i also love the cut and flow--it is fabulous and hip with skinny jeans and platform heels, but also cute with flat sandals for a day o",pos
"Usually the whole boho style looks funny on me, but the cut and print were subtle enough for me to pull it off. the colors are beautiful - probably flattering against any hair or skin tones...i took my usual small because the shoulders were generous enough. word of caution - this is dry clean only.",pos
"These are fantastic, great fit, super comfortable material and perfect length (petite). i ordered the carbon to have a neutral pair, but i also want the other colors! 0p fit 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs. length on petite is enough to have a small heel) i have short legs).",pos

"I love this dress. i found it to run one size big. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and went down a size to a 2. i purchased both a 4 and 2, then tried them on a few times, and the smaller size didn't pull at all because it fit me right, the larger one, hung lower and didn't look right. i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch. very comfortable too.",pos
I may wear these every day! i am obsessed. i am 5'8 125ibs normally a size 25/26 in jeans. i ordered these in a 26 and they fit like a glove! they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel. i am extremely happy with this purchase. these are a must have staple in anyone's wardrobe.,pos
I was very hesitant to purchase this with such a high price tag but i just received it in the mail and it is absolutely beautiful. feels and looks high quality and i can't wait to pair it with the top the model is wearing in the photos. definitely worth it!,pos
"I purchased this jacket in a pxs, as i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. the sleeve length is perfect! the fabric is soft and lightweight, which is perfect for living in southern california. i don't feel any itchiness either. the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips. 


there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem, which add nicely to the look. i like how the sleeves are ribbed, giving it a comfy sweater feel. there's also two zippered pockets, whic",pos
Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i don't mind because they are perfect!,pos
Perfect spring transition piece-- saffron yellow but medium weight and breathable. this color is in for spring and the perfect blend for a not too warm cover up!,pos
"I love this top. of course i love most things that are denim, or look like denim. this is a fun twist on a denim shirt, the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching. i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional.",pos
"Don't try this on, if you don't plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much.",pos
"This dress drapes beautifully and fits tts. i purchased the green colour in a petite small. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 120 lbs. rather than feeling clingy, this dress skims the body and hides trouble spots while highlighting everything i like about myself. for that reason i went ahead and paid full price with no regrets. looks fantastic with black tights and black ankle boots or bare legs with cowboy booties. highly recommend!!!",pos
"I love these shorts!!!! i usually have a really hard time finding shorts that fit my pear-shape, but these are great. i bought in a few different colors and i definitely will get a lot of use out of them this summer!",pos
"Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.",neg
"I absolutely love this sweater!! it's soft, easy to wash, and looks great!",pos
Love this top! pretty details and true to size fit!,pos
"I tried this on in the store on a whim. it is so flattering, soft, and pretty. i generally wear a size 12 and bought a l although the m might have fit, also: it's got plenty of room. the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible, the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed. my dimensions are about 40""  bust x 33"" waist.",pos
"Omg so i never pay full price for a t-shirt because it's just a t-shirt but there are exceptions for every rule. i can't believe i am saying this but this shirt was worth it! it is true to size (a relaxed fit) so if you are in between sizes, you could comfortably size down. the colors are just so darling. love this. not disappointed.",pos
"I purchased the one marked with the red dot (the one with the larger pattern and orange in it). i spied it in the store as soon as it arrived. i fell absolutely in love with it immediately. i am normally xl but this piece runs large so i tried the l and it's perfect. very bohemian, which i adore. first time out i folded over the top and wore it as pants and it looked fabulous with a black top. it can also be worn the way it is shown. i have also belted it and worn it with a black jacket, as show",pos
I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :),pos

"Ordered this in the orange (black, white and turquoise) print in both a small and medium. the style is cute and i like the high neckline that shows off the shoulders and swing skirt that falls beautifully and hides a multitude of figure problems. :) i also previously bought the emerson swing dress, which is the same style by maeve. the emerson style ran a bit larger and as the reviews there state, the armholes were a bit long - so i ended up with a small in that one. this lilt swing dress, howev",pos
Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.,pos
"This dress is as cute as i hoped it would be. i love the pockets and length and flattering cut. it looks great with boots and is perfect for fall. only con is that it is dry clean only. it seems like the fabric would do just fine with hand washing, and i will probably go for it. i just don't have the patience or organization for dry cleaning.",pos
Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.,pos
"I'm so pleased with this cropped chino with all its lovely colors. i have bought 3 colors so far and i love the fit and comfort of these. i'm 5""1, 104 pounds and took the 24p since this runs a size large. my favorite is the lovely moss color which really a brighter mint green and i also love the honey color for spring and summer. these fit slightly slim yet still feel relaxed. love them and highly recommend these!",pos
I love the neckline with the pleated ruffles and tie. it's graceful and distinctive yet still understated.,pos
Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey. it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely!! i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each. i usually wear a medium or large so i'd say it fits super true to size - just depends on how you want it to fit!,pos

"It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.",pos
"I wasn't sure about the color but ordered based on how much my stylist loved it. my usual xs petite fits perf daly, no chest problem (30dd) and the length is quite nice. romantic look, the drawstring in the back helps making sure the dress fits properly at the waist. it is a high low style with flowy skirt. overall great. i need to stop going to the store""",pos
"I wanted this dress in the turquoise motif, but it sold out so quickly! i tried on about 10 dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner. i got the blue and white motif, which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress. i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable. you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over, or the skirt flying up in the breeze, or needing a strapless bra. the skirt flows really nicely and over",pos
I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.,neg
"I tried this on in store in blue, and it's so comfortable. it's just the right level of loose to be flattering. for me, the cap sleeves were a little strange. they just didn't sit in a way that was flattering or seemed purposeful--not sure if that was the design or my body.",pos
I love this top. i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right. the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel. i am petite and it fits great.,pos

This is by far my favorite romper. it is very flattering and the material feels wonderful against the skin.,pos

"I found this in-store when looking for a dressy, slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding. i'm really happy with it -- the a-line cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesn't feel like i'm hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted. the flowy hemline offsets the short length (maybe 4-5"" above the knee for me). the pink color is very light -- lighter than in the photos, i think -- but it will work nicely for the wedding. as the first reviewer sai",pos
"I fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic. although i am not usually into pink, this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white. this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc. can't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it. for reference, i am 5'1, 36c chest and the small fit perfect. the quality is really high end as well.",pos

"I saw this in my local store and i fell in love with the bird pattern flowing down the right side of the shirt. for me, i bought the xs and the fit was great. i usually take a true s. the sleeves have a pulled stitching running down them and the top has nice shaping and flare to it. it is a wonderful little tee! the fabric is linen and not as soft as cotton but in this case it is not an issue as the tee does not cling to you.",pos
"I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress.

Love the look. love the fit for both professional and casual looks!!,pos
Great fit and very cute design. goes great with jeans.,pos

"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said, they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up, not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts, and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women.",pos
This is such a cute top. it runs large...i bought an xs and usually wear a small or medium. it's flowy and comfy. looks great with dark jeans.,pos
"Better than the picture, right chest neck line not too low. comfortable material and the cut is just right. bought two in different color.",pos
This is a fabulous style top! highly recommend this top. comfortable material. retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style!,pos
"I own this shirt in dark green,
navy, and white.
it is perfect. it drapes in such a flattering way, nice weight.
it shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug, emphasizing every flaw.
and finally... the buttons are placed perfectly so that you don't have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative (bra showing).
well done!",pos

i liked it so much that i ordered a second one!",pos
"First of all, this is so much prettier in person. if i were looking online, i would have scrolled right by this beauty. i am usually a medium or small in retailer tops and dresses. in jeans, i am a size 8 or 10 but i always have to get the waist taken in (little waist, big thigh problem). this piece was tricky for me but i ended up with a medium because the legs are so roomy. also, there are little ties on the sides to pull in the waist more if necessary. the scarf can also be tied behind the neck",pos
"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks",pos
"I love this skirt! as a fan of different textures and pretty things, this piece exceeded my expectations! i am always a size 0 or 2 in retailer dresses and the 2 fits like a glove. the length is perfect - just above the knee. ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick, neoprene material, i've adored the feel of it! everything feels firm and put together. the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic. it will pair well with lots of different tops too!",pos
I have two of these tops. the maroon and tan and white stripe. the material is great and the neckline lays great. it isn't too thick so i can wear it on cooler florida days. you can dress it up under a jacket or dress down with some jeans.,pos

"Just received these and they fit perfectly, but the panels are different shades of gray. the color is not consistent and it make them look bad. they are perfect otherwise, but sadly they are not wearable. i will be returning",neg
I would highly recommend this top. it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas. much prettier than the picture depicts. i am very happy with this purchase. can't wait to wear with black or white capris this summer.,pos
"Although it may not look like it takes on a shape - what a wonderfully flattering jumper. was intrigued from seeing it in the catalog and had to try it on in the store -- i was unsure how the middle would appear. but it fit, wonderfully feminine, looking forward to the summer.",pos
"Cute top. a little delicate. my top arrived with a rip in the sleeve. fortunately, my tailor was able to fix it.",pos
"Unique vest: modern, chic. i especially like the color block one the collar part. i know it will become a staple in my working clothes, and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes. i don't think the back of this vest is of bad quality, like another reviewer said. overall it's a hight-quality piece.",pos

"These leggings are gorgeous. soft suede feel, perfect fit, great look, especially for dressing up and going out. love them.",pos
Purchased for myself and loved the fabric and unique design. it runs very large and the size smaller was not available so it was returned.,pos
"This top is really pretty. i love the details on the back tail of the shirt. the colors in this shirt are really pretty more like a peachy pink to me. i will however line dry this shirt because of the different fabric on the tail of the shirt. i would not iron that portion of the shirt either. overall, i am completely in love with this shirt. it will be a staple in my closet.",pos
"Incredibly soft and comfortable, not as fitted as i would like (this often happens to me with skinny pants, though). i want to wear these guys everyday!",pos
"Love the pockets and back of dress. the buttons on the the straps allow for them to be adjusted. that's a plus. i'm 5'3"" with an athletic build at 34d. the medium fits perfect",pos
Such a cute jean! got these specifically for the tie up lace ankle (and price)! also love the shade of gray i bought.,pos
"The perfect summer pants. i will be ordering more colors and possibly a smaller size. i think the slim fit would look just as good in a less slouchy size. i bought a size 31 petite in the dark blue (not navy) and they fit perfect and the color is amazing. very high quality, feel very soft and comfy. for reference, i'm curvy, 5'2"", 146 lbs, usual size is a 31 (10-12) but i've recently been losing weight so my sizing may be off. the pants do stretch out like most pilcro chinos.",pos
"This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings, and is also a great look with my casual denim, paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.",pos
"I saw this dress and loved everything about it! i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big. they were out of the smaller size, so i had to return it. the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture.",neg
"The images definitely do not do the jacket justice. the detail is beautiful, and the fabric is unexpected and quite luxurious.",pos
"It's no surprise that this sweater coat is getting five stars. it's beautifully made, has a fun pattern, and fits great.

i purchased the xs (regular size). there weren't any of the petite sizes left for me but the xs fits perfectly. the sleeves hit at my wrist (i'm 5'2"") while the length hits right at the top of my knees. i did notice that the shoulder width could be too tight if you are a more broad person.

the colors are accurate to the website and catalog. this seems so extremely versatile",pos
"If i could wear this top every single day, i would. this is the white flowy top i've been dreaming of; but better! the fabric is so lightweight and breathable. i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf, skinny jeans & ankle boots, or on a hot summer day with shorts/skinnies and sandals. you can dress it up or down. be aware that the chest hem is at a non-traditional height; not quite above or below the breasts. however, i think it looks flattering on both small-chested and busty women.",pos

"This is an absolutely beautiful dress, but arrived with several holes in it!",neg

they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair.",pos
"This is a beautiful and classic blouse. great fit and flow. however, the silk is very light and the snap falls off easily; tricky to sew back on since the fabric is so delicate.",pos
Not flattering and not the color it appears online. this is really a pink shirt.,neg
"I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out. 


i live in houston, tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model,",pos
"I just purchased this cute dress on sale and made sure to size down one size so instead of my regular small, i ordered an extra small which fits me perfectly. i'm a petite yet busty 34d-27-35 and 5'4"" and think the dress looks adorable on especially since i'm a huge fan of all things plaid. it's a lighter weight dress so it's perfect for spring or summer but can be worn in fall/winter with this color scheme by adding tights, boots and a sweater or jacket. i also love that it has pockets. i don't",pos

This top is the very same top meadow rue had a couple of years ago. i have that top and it is identical so my guess is meadow rue and deletta are owned by the same company.,pos
"This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size, i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well.",pos
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this in the size xl. it fits very nicely; not tight. i usually have problems with peplum blouses hitting me oddly since i have a short waist, but this fit beautifully. i like the feel of the high quality fabric. the color green works so well with my red hair. i highly recommend this blouse.",pos
"I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality t-shirt/sweater. unfortunately, it is made of cheap looking material that is 50% acrylic and see-through.",neg
"Do not waste your money on this.
at first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock. 
fyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.
still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.",neg
"I tried this top on in the store and didn't buy it because i was in a hurry. obsessed about it and it was sold out when i went back. so happy i was able to get it online, it's beautiful. i got a medium and it fits perfectly, enough room that it hangs nicely but not baggy, i'm typically a medium in shirts at retailer. it looks beautiful with high waisted black pants. i wear a cami underneath. i own it in white and tried it on with a black bra only and it looked great, i just didn't feel comfortable",pos

This sweater coat is really cute and soft (i hate itchy sweaters). the blue is lovely and the cut is flattering. i'm going to check it out in other colors as well!,pos
"I looooove these. the styling makes me wonder if i could even wear them to work on casual fridays with the right top they are so great. i am a little concerned about how they will hold up over time since some of the stitching looks a little shoddy, but they are still worth it at this price. i am going to order another pair just in case they don't hold up, i love them that much.",pos
"I love this sweater. as others have mentioned, it's not the softest acrylic in the world, but i can overlook that for the simple fact that it's adorable. i like the cropped fit- pairs perfectly with high waisted jeans/skirts. the embroidery has a sort of handmade feel to it without looking cheap. the slit up only one side makes it unique in my opinion. i did expect it to be a bit heavier, but it's a great layering piece and ideal for transitioning into colder weather. i may be biased because of",pos

"I love my new maxi dress! as soon as i put it on, i knew this dress would be my go to dress of the summer. i love the styling with the thicker shoulder straps and higher cleavage. you will definitely be able to wear a regular bra with this dress. the material is soft, light, and flows well. i particularly love the ruffle on the bottom of the dress - it adds that extra little feminine touch. i can't wait to wear it.",pos
"Great versatile skirt, very flattering",pos
"This one will be going back. the color is really blah and the fabric wasn't a texture i was expecting--it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day. overall, the cut and style is cute, but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style. this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric.",neg
So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!,pos
First thing i would say these pants run large i'm a size 6 the size 4 fit perfect i love the style and look of the cascade fabric on leg of these pants but these pants are a little heavy still a beautiful pant,pos
Beautiful top that will go with anything. looking forward to wearing it.,pos
"I got the red- it is a great color. this is one of those thin soft t shirts. it drapes really nicely and dresses up or dresses down. the only downside for me is that it takes a little extra effort in the washing department, but really not much- just have to line dry.",pos
I purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey. i love them both but the grey is by far my fave. this is a nice soft beautiful tee. the burst of flowers are just adorable. i found these ran tts on me. cute little top and such a good deal at sale price.,pos
"I'm 5'3"" about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all. i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6, but could tell that even if i had the 4, the cut of it still wouldn't be flattering on me at all. it was baggy in odd places and had no shape. the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice, with a fitted slip design.",neg

"Pros: this skirt is a stunner. beautiful, rich color and great quality. the cut is conservative enough to be work appropriate, but the little peek of above-the-knee leg where the slit is makes it interesting and flattering as well.

cons: slightly smelly when it comes out of the bag- i'm optimistic this will mostly go away though. expensive.

fit: i'm 5'8"", 125 lbs, 34b, normally wear a 26 or 27 in pants, and the size 2 fit great. i often wear a size 4 in skirts despite a size 2 fitting fine in",pos

This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed - it is extremely well fitted in the chest. the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining. a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction. also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric. i am normally a 4/6 at retailer and the 8 was extremely small.,neg

i really wanted to love it bc they design is adorable.
i need to return it!!",neg
I saw this in the store in a display and tried it on. i got it in the sky color which is a lavender blue color. the front and back are both cute. this top can be dressed up or worn with jeans.,pos
"Gave this to a friend as a gift.  soft, lovely.  she loves it.",pos
"I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site, but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.",pos
Great color. great length. will go perfect with leggings and skinny jeans/pants. this will work well when the weather transitions and will be super cute under a cardigan when it gets cold.,pos

"Based on the mixed reviews about fit, i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise, it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall",pos
"This was my favorite piece in my order. it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors. they don't. i voice the other reviewers opinion: get more colors in of this style. i would order in a heartbeat. i plan on wearing this to work (it's freezing in my office) but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look. the material was soft, woven tightly (a good thing) and well made. good one retailer! definitely a keeper.",pos
"When i saw this online, i wondered why this dress cost so much. i have been keeping my eye on it for some time. loved what i saw, the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical. i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got it:

pros:
- the colors you see online are exactly the same in person.
- the jeweled neckline is lovely. it's one thing that drew me to it. this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh",neg
This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!,neg

"Gorgeous with that retailer uniqueness.

unfortunately this shade of yellow just wasn't right for me.

but it is a beautiful dress",pos

"I got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up), the fabric is very nice, medium weight and drapes well. it is a little boxy but would be nice to layer over a button down.",pos
"I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts. unfortunately, this fell short as it was huge. not only was it big, it flared at the bottom. it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump, but not what i am going for right now. if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i'm sad that i'll have to return it.",neg

"I didn't give this dress a second look for the longest time. when the summer tag sale came about, i decided to pop in and see if i could find a versatile summer dress. i was in need of a piece i could easily dress up or down. the burnt orange color variation caught my eye first, though i also tried on the neutral and it is also fabulous. this dress is amazing on! i am an hourglass shape, 5'8, size 6/8, 34 d chest, and i tried on both the small and medium. the small fit much better on me, and i r",pos
I didn't think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love!  i am typically a medium and this was true with this.  i have a 34dd chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesn't show. i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too.  just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it.,pos
"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.",neg

"Coh emerson style jeans are the best fit and style. the ""pacifica"" color is a light blue and nice for spring and summer. i love the slim boyfriend. i have thighs and they fit like a skinny without being super tight. there is just enough stretch. no holes either. they are easy to dress up or down and have become my new favorites.",pos
"I meant to order this online and forgot. i was very happy when i was able to get it in one of the stores yesterday. it's everything a summer dress should be: flowy, lightweight and a great print. i can't believe there's no reviews and that it still available in every size. for reference i got a small i am 5'4""  135. this dress i thought would make me look wide because it's all straight across but in fact it really has a great flow and is cut well. grab it while you can.",pos

These are a soft and lightweight material. the photos here don't show the tiny beautiful pattern on them. look closely through the photos and you'll see it. way better than a normal pair of black summer pants. these are very log so i plan to hem to flats to wear for a more casual look but they have the ability to go either way. the pockets flare out a big so i'm going to have those sewn shut when i do the hemming. it is a higher west so great for that look or to wear with some cropped style summ,pos

This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.,neg

"The lace on this is gorgeous. it's feminine and elegant and fancy! definitely know if peplum style tops work for you before purchasing. if you have a large waist, it will just make you look bigger. but the top portion is nice and fitted, so i think it's very flattering. i'm 34c, 140b and got the small. fits great.",pos

I ordered this for my honeymoon and it's perfect! true to size and great with cute shorts!,pos
This sweater/jacket is great over any blouses. love the color. it looks more slightly peachy cream color that i love! goes with everything. warm. i thought it ran true to size. i ordered a small and love the way it fits. if you are looking for more of an oversized piece then you would need to size up.,pos

"This sweater drapes beautifully, but beware it is pretty light weight and feels more poly or nylon than wool. i dont know if you could wear a top with sleeves underneath either, it will probably work best with just a cami. that said, i love the style. note... the sweater is pretty long. i am 5'2 and normally 12-14p and the regular size came down to my knees. the lp was perfect, just covers my tush and has adequate room for curves.",pos

I agree the pictures are confusing. the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate. this is such a great dress! it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicer/dressier looking in person than i imagined it would be. i think it fits true to size. i either wear a 4 or a 6 in most retailer dresses and the 4 in this dress fits me well. i'm planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon! i definitely recommend!,pos

"This tank is wonderful for those with full hips because it hangs just right to cover any flaws. the colors are bright and the material is soft. there is a band at the end that elevates the tank so you can wear it out if you would like. not too low in the front and overall the tank runs true to size. i suppose if you wanted a tighter fit you could size down 1 size, but i like the way it hangs in my regular size. i'm very busty and hippy and this top makes both look slim. highly recommend.",pos

"This dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays. i can't wait to wear it! the bottom portions shines (i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine) but it really stands out with the darker background. the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures. i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one, leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg.",pos
"I was very impressed upon receiving this dress. i'm 5'3, 102lbs and ordered xs. fit perfect. i am also a 32dd, so if you are smaller than a d or big c, the top portion might be a little big for you. love how it is lined so you could technically wear without a bra. i bought the tangerine and have gotten many complements.",pos
"This blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times. the quality is excellent, the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible. i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry, the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere. i highly recommend it.",pos

"Unique and stylish dress, looks much better on than in the pictures.",pos
"I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.",neg
"This is by far the cutest, most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on! it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places, it doesn't show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events. absolutely love this suit in navy. wasn't in love with the rest of the patterns, hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon!",pos
"I have owned a lot of stevies in the past. the only problem with them for me has been the rise. i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise. voila! these have the perfect mid rise (for me). they are really soft. too long for my 29 inch inseam. they bunch at the ankles, but don't drag. i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle, but i also think they're fine how they are. i bought my normal size. they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them. t",pos
"Perfect for when you're a guest at someone's home , having guests or just lounging !  prettiest set you'll ever own... you'll feel as if your on vacation even if you're not. i wouldn't travel without this set !! highly recommend. love.",pos
"I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years. they fit great (tts), stay put, and wear very well. these are well worth the price.",pos
"Form fitting, hugs in the right spots, and love the pattern. it's a little shorter than i expected and too formal to wear to work. however, an excellent evening dress.",pos
"You can't tell by the photo but the top is actually a slightly shiny material...so it gives it a classy, going out look. in the picture it looks more casual, but i can see myself wearing this on a night out with a skirt, wearing it to work, or whatever. i tried it on and i thought ""wow, i look thin."" it's a little shorter than i normally wear (don't worry, it's not a crop top, but notice where the bottom hem sits on the models hips, probably mid-rise), but it looked amazing on. zippers in the ba",pos
"This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim, and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me, and once it arrived i couldn't wait to put it. once i put it on, i couldn't wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings, shorts, and sandals. such an easy, classic, simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.",pos
"This dress has a beautiful shape. it was a onesie in a store (only one they had) and i'm glad i tried it on. usually i'm a 6 or 4. this is an 8, and it's a perfect fit. definitely size up at least one dress size. the knit shoulders are beautiful and the belt is slimming. i love the writing on it. it's a classic dress and it makes me feel beautiful and unique.",pos
"Oh my, i just received my dress and it is gorgeous!. i was a little skeptical with the reviews but i am on the slender side so perhaps that is the body type it works for. i am 34b with a 25 waist. i got a size 0 and it fits well. i am 5'5"" and the length is good too, not too long. i could wear reasonable heel/wedges. it is a great class, sophisticated look. the material is great quality. i can't wait for an occasion to wear it to!",pos
"I came across this in the store and immediately fell in love with it. the online photos just don't do it justice! i bought the white version because the little pops of red in the details and the dobby weave are so sweet and unique. 

a size 0 fit perfectly. the fabric is a bit sheer, so be prepared to wear a cami underneath. very light, airy, and comfortable!",pos
"These are the second pair of paige jeans i have purchased, and i have not been disappointed! jeans are great for casual dress or a night out on the town. fit stays true even after first wash. wish i had a pair of these in every color.",pos
"Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly.",pos
"Dress just arrived and i was a bit nervous of the fit based on the other six reviewers stating it runs small. i actually found it to run exactly true to size. i'm 5'6"" 38-26-38 slender, and on average i wear a size 6, which is what i ordered - 6 regular and it fits as though it was custom made for me. this dress is made very well - looks tailored and hits me right above the knee similar to the model. i feel i scored big by purchasing it at the sale price.",pos
"Best bathing suit bottoms ever. low-rise doesn't work forever, and this bottom is perfect if you want a little more coverage without being too mom-ish. the ruching gives it a really cute retro feel (as opposed to a granny panties feel). my usual size small fits great, and i definitely did not have the problem another reviewer did with it coming up past the belly button (it hits me right where it hits the model in the photo). i just wish they made it in more prints! there are some really cute top",pos
"Love the asymmetrical zipper, style, fabric and color. so soft, comfy and warm. i got a size small and it fits perfectly and isn't tight or loose. the pockets are sewn shut but easily opened by cutting the thread with scissors. highly recommend this cute and functional jacket!",pos
Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.,neg
Bought the green t shirt.  very pretty subtle floral detail near the shoulders.  love scalloped neck design.  this t is more sheer than the average t so i'll be layering it over a tank.  fit is true to size.,pos
"Love this jacket! the sleeves are a little big/loose but it's not quite as flattering as it could be, but it's so comfy it's worth it! great quality.",pos
This jacket is cute and comfy!,pos
"This jacket is extremely good quality, has gorgeous detailing and is warm! quilting makes it thicker than expected, but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket. highly recommend.",pos
"I am so love in this top, i wish i had it in all colors and will absolutely be watching the sale rack for these ones. i love this top. i work out at a gym that requires tops, but that means i cannot usually display my awesome sports bras with cute strappy backs. this yoga top has an open back which will show these off, which i really like. the draped back keeps you nice and cool also. and the fit is amazing. i have some extra baby belly that i can't seem to work off-it was invisible in this top.",pos
"Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash ( gentle hand wash cycle). also, there are no bra-straps holders, and my bra straps did show up a lot...",neg
I absolutely love this top. i'm always either an x-small or 0/2 in mauve. i think this top runs small. i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest. i'm average in bust.,pos

"I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9"" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and",neg
My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size 4 and the size small fit great with some room.,pos
"So the other review complained that there are slits on the sleeves of this blouse. yes, that is true. however, i love that about this blouse! i tried this blouse on in the store so the slits were not a surprise to me, but i can understand how they may upset a customer who wasn't expecting them. i think the slits are elegant and are in no way obtrusive or revealing. you could totally still wear this blouse to work or a nice dinner. i love it because its unique enough to be worn alone and simple i",pos
It is so beautiful and just as shown in the pictures! very elegant! i normally wear a small and it hung off me just a little.,pos
This is a sweet top as it is shown. on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top. this is not so-the entire front of the top is see through. one would need to wear a camisole. the material on the blouse is very sheer-it appears to be rather cheap actually. if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath. that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,neg
"I wish this dress was more fitted.. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture. i bought this dress in an xs, but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress. it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears. i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress. sad to say that it is going back.",neg
"I'm glad i tried this on. i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print, but i wasn't so sure about the cut or style of the top. once it was on, however, i loved it. i don't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear. they're cute on rail-thin, young girls, but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s. this top is the exception. the details from the buttons to the thin pleats, the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering. i wore",pos
"Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up, mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8's weren't big at all, so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband, but i don't think that can be prevented.",pos
"The softest cotton gauze but, not see through. relaxed but, the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress, going back for it in white!",pos
"These are really nice jeans (i am a jean fanatic). some ""patches"" are faded others are dark with still others with stitching across them. very distinctive and nice. they are truly a boyfriend fit...so, if you them big, they are. ag makes very nice jeans both in fit and quality. i buy other brands, but not often...",pos
"I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put",pos
"As much as i wanted to love this top, it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am (i'm a size 6). maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference.",neg
"I'm 5' tall and 95 pounds and ordered this in an xxsp.  it's a little loose but still looks really attractive on my body.  it's warmer and thicker than i thought it would be and lined.  i love it!  taller petites might want to size into regular because even on my super-petite body it hit a few inches above the knees - perfect length for me but will hit higher for those taller.
it's going to become a staple!",pos
"I really love this dress. it's very flattering for all body types - i'm 5'4"", 120 and i purchased a small. it also looks really cute with a stretchy belt. in the picture - it doesn't show this, but it has these cute snap sleeves that adds some great detail. it's also very comfortable. it is a thin material, so for those looking for a thicker fabric - this may not be the right dress. loved it!",pos
I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5'9''. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet!,pos
I don't normally like how i look in rompers but this one was so cute i had to try.  i was pleasantly surprised that it fit great and was comfortable too!,pos
I bought a size 8 a few years back not my regular size but when used it tend to sag. so this time i bought a size 6 my regular size.,pos
"Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.",pos
"These are nice, comfortable summer pants that travel well. the material has a nice feel to it,lightweight, but not too thin. they are easy to wear with any summer top, and look just dressy enough. i like the elastic waist, but the pants will stretch out a bit, and run a little large.",pos
"I saw these sweaters in the store this fall and took a pass - they didn't look cute and i thought they wouldn't be cute on, because the little pockets looked droopy --but i was so wrong! once they went on sale, i took a chance b.c. i needed a black lightweight cardigan for a trip. ordered a size small and it fits perfect - so cute, i just love it! glad i bought it at the sale price because now i'm even happier!",pos
"I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate, it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t, and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.",pos
Lovely statement shift. sweet and sophisticated at the same time. the lightweight knit drapes nicely over one's figure. my store showed it paired with a collared cream-white blouse for alternative styling. i know i'll be experimenting with solid tees.,pos
"I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large, or something? ! i ordered an xs, my usual size, xs-s. the body of the shirt is very loose, the upper arms are a bit snug, and i don't have large arms. the shoulder seams are in a very strange place, but when you look at the model, it doesn't look so bad. with the shirt i received, and another reviewer, the seam was puffy, making for a strange look. in theory, the shirt should have worked, but didn't. i loved the pattern, not the fit.",neg
"The top is gorge, it may look somewhat slouchy but it falls perfect and looks great, especially the navy color with white jeans. i liked it so much i ordered the ivory color too. beware the quality of this top is extremely delicate and if you don't want it to snag, do not wear a bracelet that can snag it.",pos
Love it. goes well with a lot. super soft,pos
"The design on the blue sweater is actually a dark navy (not black, as i thought it was), but it still looks beautiful with black underneath. rather than jeans like it's shown, the v-neck is a nice change from other cardigans i have - looks great with a cami or another v-neck underneath it. soft, nice medium-weight and not at all itchy. happy with this as an easy everyday sweater.",pos
"I love finding unique retailer pieces that don't require dry cleaning. i was excited to find this shirt, but it's not flattering. the bottom hem is a little tight, which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky. perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips. i also didn't like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person. i'll be returning this item.",neg
Love this dress so much. it's super comfortable and i always get a ton of compliments every time i wear it. the fabric is the perfect weight not too heavy. i'll be wearing this all summer long.,pos
"Cute swing tee! fit for me is perfect. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs and i bought my usual small. length is nice. fits me just at my hips. i can wear to work and on the weekends. a little concerned  the fabric may pill so i'm taking extra care. receive compliments every time i wear either color. love.",pos
"Fits well, comfortable and flattering. i wouldn't call this pattern fabric purple though. it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color.. the picture is an accurate representation of the color.",pos
"I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight, soft, flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !",pos
"I bought this in the green plaid for travel since i don't wear long pants of this fabric weight here in honolulu. it is styled so that you can roll the bottoms up for a more casual look, showing some ankle and wearing dress flats . would be a perfect casual work look with a navy tee. since i'm only 5'3"" and this is travel-wear, i got it in a regular rather than petite because i wanted to keep the cuffed-look but cover my ankles. i tend toward adventure travel and these held up well on a recent t",pos
"Like the other reviewers said, it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured. i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it's an open vest. i love if!",pos
"Love the aqua print, which looks vaguely japanese to me. the quality is good, but unlike the other reviewer, i had to size up. my usual size x small was too tight. wish there were more colors.",pos
"This is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small. i usually take a small but i took a medium in this. for reference i am 130 lbs, chest 36c. i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate. got the 20% off today and couldn't be happier with this purchase.",pos
This tee is so cute and well constructed. it's not a fabric that's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love. it runs tts and i like that it's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra!,pos
"I bought this dress in green and i really like it. the bodice is a substantial knit - light enough for summer but thicker and sturdier than the typical jersey tee - and the skirt is a lightweight woven fabric with good drape. true to size and extremely comfortable. it's a great work dress. the striped colorblocking is not very flattering on my frame (broad shoulders, larger chest) but it's not bad. you'll probably want to try it on in person.",pos
"Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and",pos
"This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric. ordered my usual size, but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me. embroidery pretty, but background is more of a muddy gray, then denim as shown. if the smaller size in petite was available, i'd have exchanged it, but it is going back.",neg
"I reallllly love this sweater! i could wear it every day if i could. the sweater is comfortable, lightweight (but not see through) and versatile.",pos
"Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic, but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling, ""get it off"" in the fitting room. bummer.",neg
"I have many moulinette soeurs creations. all are true to my size, breathtakingly beautiful, unique, made well. i ordered this dress, and i am very excited about receiving it soon. the front neckline is round, and it becomes a v in the back.",pos

"This is such a pretty top.  i love the mix of patterns. the colors are beautiful!  it really looks great on.  the peplum is very minimal in this top.  the entire top itself is somewhat oversized, but in a pretty way.  i bought this in a large and probably could have gone with a medium, but didn't want the length to be any shorter, so i'm sticking with the large.  for reference,  i'm 6ft and 175lbs.  i usually wear a size 10/12 or medium/large.  also, i didn't notice a puckering between the two m",pos
I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....,pos
"Such a great shirt! loved the fit and how it feels! i paired it with grey jeans!
loved it so much i ordered it in another color for myself and ordered one for a friend!!!",pos
"This is a beautiful sweater. high quality cashmere was used as it is very soft. as other reviewers stated, the sweater does run large. so i purchased one size down and ordered an xxs, for a perfect fit. i went with yellow, which is a great color. this is not high low, which i love! i am so thrilled, that just as soon as i'm finished writing this review, i'm going to purchase another sweater in red.",pos
"This top looks so much better on than it does in the pictures! very flattering cut and the fabric is amazingly comfortable. runs true to size, i got my normal xs.",pos
"Love this and wish it came in more colors. the fabric and cut are so comfortable. i bought my usual size and was a little sad to see that it shrunk just a touch in the wash. washed and then air dried but put in dryer for 15 mins to speed up drying process. i'm 5'7"" so it's already short but now i'll probably just have to wear it as a cover up or loungewear around the house. super cute though and great price with sale on sale!",pos
These jeans are very comfortable. i really like the high waist. just what i was looking for!,pos
"This is a beautiful and fashionable blouse. it feels good on as it is made of viscose, it is pretty and feminine. color is great, of course it needs to be your color. i love it and recommend it!!",pos
This skirt fits amazing. i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus. this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe.,pos
"I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store, tried it on but didn't have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed. noticed it on sale online and had to order. it is so comfortable and flattering. the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape. not slinky at all.",pos
Very nice polka-dot pattern. i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors. i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans. it is a timeless classic!!,pos
"Loved the green color, the cut is super flattering, but alas, i do need hte petite, ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost. unfrotuantely, the color is sold out in petite :-(",pos
I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.,pos
So super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress,pos
"I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one, buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not",neg
I loved this skirt. the material is so fun and a love the pattern. unfortunately they didn't have the size i needed so it had to go back to the store,pos
"I have had a lot of complements while wearing this dress. i purchased it in the grey. other reviews felt that this dress ran large. i agree that it might be a little larger than other retailer purchases i have made but not by much. i purchased it in small (usually what i wear in dresses) i'm very tall at 5'9"" (mostly legs) and the length is great. also the neck line is perfect on me and i have a fairly average torso length. . i am very happy with the purchase.",pos

"I've never owned a romper before but after trying it on at the store, i fell in love! i'm pear-shaped 5""4 at 185#. i got a med and it fits beautifully with just enough room to not be baggy. i got the red mitif. super flattering.",pos
"I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces, so when i saw this sweatshirt online, i ordered it right away.  it&#39;s adorable and quirky, however, when i received it in the mail, it reminded me of something my grandma would wear.  the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long, while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing.  if this was a more tailored sweatshirt, i would be keeping it, but sadly it&#39;s going back.",neg
This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy. it's flattering and looks great with jeans.,pos

What a cute swing sweater and so easy to layer. this jacket looks great snapped or left open and the collar and hood leave such a soft look around your neck. this has such great elements of cozy and warmth just in time for cool weather!,pos
I really like the skirt! it's very comfortable and i can wear it with  so many colors.,pos
Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.,pos

Such a pleasant surprise. i saw this in the store and had to try it on. it looks and feels like a lightweight real suede. the color is a wonderful neutral-much prettier than what i am seeing in the pic here. fits tts. although i will wear 0-2 petites in dresses and some pants i found the regular xs to be just right.,pos
"This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops, but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere, but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area, so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton, so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath, and i can't see m",pos

it's long, i found it to be just below knee length (5'6"").
if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.
it has pockets too btw :)
this will be worn over everything this summer, let's hope the poly/rayon/spandex blend washes ok!",pos

"This is such a cool military jacket. when i saw it displayed on a table at my local retailer, i knew it was going home with me. this is my 4th marrakech jacket, i love their style. i bought the black in my usual size large, and i agree with the previous reviewer, if you have a chest this is a very flattering jacket. i usually wear my jackets open, and i discovered that if you button back the lapels at the second button down it looks amazing and not so sloppy. it kind of bothered me the way",pos
"When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!",pos
"I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8"" and the dress is very short on me. it'",neg

"I bought this in store yesterday in a 2 petite - it definitely looks best if you can get it in your usual size (4 petite just looked too big and changes the look). love the embroidery detail. it was on display with the sleeves rolled up to elbows, and it's really cute that way too.",pos
"I'm always an xl in retailer blouses, and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep. however, in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would, meaning i had to go down 2 sizes. even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy. the body is cut like a trapeze a-line, so very forgiving. the fabric has a lot of stretch to it, so the arms aren't tight. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice. just a heads up for anyone who would c",pos
"I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!

fit: i am 5'6"" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap",pos
I am six feet tall and this sweater is a perfect fit for tunic length over skinny jeans. if you are shorter i assume it would be longer. i bought the green color which is a beautiful dark hunter green. the bodice is fitted and doesn't show any bra straps and the bottom is slightly loose and forgiving . love this sweater!,pos
"The dress is as great 'in person' as it shows in the pictures. if you usually buy petite keep in mind that you may like the regular size if you prefer the llonger look. if you prefer a shorter length go for the petite size if this is what you usually get. i am 5.3, 117 lbs and tried both, xs regular and xs petite. i ultimately went with the regular size as i preferred the longer length.
everything about this dress is perfect, the color, the material, the cut. highly recommended as a transition",pos
"The print and fabric are great, but this dress has odd construction, or maybe i have an odd construction. anyway, i'm 5-5, weigh 125-130, 36d. i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms - but the issue was in the hips. i'm somewhere between athletic and curvy. the skirt looks more a-line in the photo, but it's actually cut pretty straight. spanx would have helped, but i'm not about to wear spanx all day in a work/casual dress, i think a medium would make the top too big, so i",neg
"I have been watching this dress online since it arrived, finally decided to order it online. it is as great in person as it looks on the website. the fabric, cut and finishing of the dress are high quality and my usual size 10 fits great. it falls about 3"" above the knee on my 5'5"" frame which is a little short for the office, but i could do it on a friday with a cardigan. the fit is comfortable and flattering for a gal with broad shoulders and small curves. when i tried it on friends raved. thi",pos
"I ordered in this in the kelly green and loved it so much i wore it the very next day after it came in the mail. the green color is gorgeous and easily complements so many other colors in my wardrobe. the cardigan itself is super comfy and i love the full length long-sleeves! so many cardigans these days come with 3/4 length sleeves, which are fine, but sometimes you want a long sleeve. the fit almost runs on the larger side, but i think that a slightly looser look works well for this cardigan,",pos
How can you go wrong with soft cotton top that is neither too snug nor too loose? expect will wear these as layers under when really cold and by them selves in early spring and in the fall. great colors and love the multiple textures.,pos
"I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size, as i had to size up because it was the only size available, and it is a little large in the stomach and rear, but it works well in the chest area. the v neck isn't too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also, it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase, just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more",pos
Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!,pos
"I love the material on these shorts. unfortunately, that's all i love. the fit is awkward and i'm an easy fit. they're boxy in the body / legs and a bit tight in the waist, causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well. sadly, couldn't keep these just for the pretty fabric.",neg

"I was looking for a dress that would make me feel as special as i would feel when i attend my daughter's baby shower. this design, featuring a variety of spring influenced flower motifs embossed upon an eyelet fabric, was exactly what my mind's eye envisioned! the use of the solid colored shirtdress button line and cuffs softly pulled all the elements of this unique work beautifully together. i found the fit to be almost costumed made for my figure. the number of compliments i received on the da",pos
"I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage, interesting neckline that covers bra straps, good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of",pos
"I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail. i'm petite and fairly curvy, so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped, i couldn't imagine anyone it would fit. the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward, and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose.",neg
"Had to return this for a couple of reasons: 1) was too small! it's made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand. i didn't bother to order a size up because i wasn't sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large. 2) the main color isn't grey, like the picture. it's a black and white checkered pattern. so, it doesn't look at all grey irl.

i'm still recommending because, if you get the right size, and like the colors, it will be a nice, light and comfy swea",neg
This is a beautiful top. it is something great to have in your wardrobe for the holiday season or a nice date night option. i highly recommend it. it runs true to size. the price is actually reasonable as far as dressy retailer tops go as well!,pos
"This shirt is absolutely beautiful! the front is very thin and delicate, but wearing a nude bra underneath, you can't see a thing. i did need to add a snap between the top two buttons to avoid the chest ""gap"" but the back of the shirt offers enough stretch that it doesn't appear to ""pull"" at all. it's hard to find a button down that fits nicely when your short waisted and large chested. this one is it!!!!",pos
"Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms, and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size, is beautiful, and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically, but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all, but is thick enough to be seamless.",pos
"Like other reviewers have mentioned, i was hesitant to spend so much money on a swimsuit. after lots of searching and reading reviews to try to find a bathing suit for a newly postpartum body, i went for it. i am so happy that i did - it fits perfectly. snug in all the right places, and makes my extra baby pudge seem nonexistent. before baby i was a bikini-only kind of girl, so i wasn't sure how i'd feel in a one piece in this style. it really is better than i could have imagined. i highly recom",pos
"I love this shirt! it is so soft and a bit see through, so recommend wearing a camisole underneath. perfect with jeans! the fit is slightly boxy, but works well.",pos
"This top is amazing! i originally ordered it in small, which fit, but opted for a large for the option of wearing it more off or the shoulder. the large fit perfect! great length for leggings and can wear both off the shoulder or just one... can't wait for fall! for reference, i'm 135 lbs, 34b.",pos
"This is my favorite kind of dress: comfortable, unique, and can dress up or down. i am 5'2 and 100 lb, and bought the regular 0 because there were no petites available. it fit perfectly! the material is buttery soft and looks like it will hold up well, and i love the orange-red color. the tie detail makes this dress stand out and i find the cut very flattering. so glad i ordered it!!",pos
Love this top!  it is fitted through the shoulders and arms and has a slight swing.  the peplum falls at a great spot and the material lays nicely.  very flattering on my 5 months postpartum body that is on the rebound.  i got the blue but i might get the pink too!,pos
"This blouse is a beauty! i love the hemline across the bust and all the flowy fabric that drapes in front and in back. i love the long length and the side slits. the wide hemline at the bottom is lovely. the cotton is soft and light and as amazing to wear as it is to look at. it makes me feel beautiful just having it on. be aware the fabric is sheer and requires a tank, but i don't mind as it is both pretty and comfortable. i sized up, which fits how i like. i never tried it on in my normal size",pos
"These wanderer pants are my go to. i love the patch pocket styling. they are true to size, but seem to stretch, so buy a size down. trust me, it will work.",pos
"This is the best little romper i have ever tried on. i don't typically love myself in shorts but these are so flowing and the pattern is so pretty i couldn't resist. the material is nice and the length is great. i'm 5'6"" and 135lbs and the small fit great.",pos
"I tried these on in-store not intending to buy them (was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans!) and loved them! great ""medium blue"" color and they fit me so nicely (i am 5'2"" with actual hips and thighs :) ...the price is a bit high for me though. hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale!",pos
"I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans, front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle, (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories, belt, necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.",pos
"This dress makes me so sad...the textured stretchy fabric, color, length, and overall swingy fit are spot on. as another reviewer noted though, the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress. the neck is tiny, which i could have gotten over once it was on, but the arm holes were just awful - too big all around (too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut). basically, you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes. it could have been so good, but alas, but t",neg
"I'm so happy i decided to order this dress! i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and normally buy xs petite, but the comments said the dress is a little short so i went with a xs regular in navy. i am glad i did -- it hits me about 2-3 inches above the knee. the material is very soft and seems well constructed. a bit thicker than your average summer dress but i like that! very flattering overall, and for the price it's a great steal!",pos
"I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful, well-fitting, and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly, but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees.",pos
"I had bee struggling to find a romper with longer length shorts, it seems like so many of the rompers have short shorts for the bottom half and i wanted something to hit upper mid leg, something like a 4"" inseam on a short. on a whim i ordered this and hoped it would be long enough and sure enough it is perfect. still stylish and still ""short"" for summer without it being so short on the bottom. well made! nice closure at bust so there is no gaping.",pos
"I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.
wouldn't recommend it.",neg
"This is a soft, light sweater that will take you through fall. i got the raspberry, which seems more like a cinnamon color to me. the design is really cute with the fabric inset in the back. i got three of these in different colors so obviously i really like them for layering and can recommend them! it seems tts. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs. medium is perfect.",pos
"I really love the colors of this dress - very unique and classy combo. little bit of a retro look to it. even though there is no zipper it's somehow fitted and flattering. i plan to wear it to a wedding this summer in the mountains where it gets chilly in the evening so i'm thrilled to find a summer dress with sleeves. it will work well for plenty of other occasions too. only problem is the buttons on the sleeves are nearly impossible to button. just too tight. for reference i'm 5'9"", 140 lbs an",pos
"Really like these -- they fit really well and look great with a pair of chucks and a sweater if i'm dressing down a bit, as well as with flats and a nicer blouse. really versatile. i'm kind of pear-shaped, and these seem to minimize my flaws a bit, too, so that never hurts!",pos
I love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors. i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice!,pos

Love this shirt. i have a bit of a tummy so i usually don't buy shorter shirts but with my high waisted denim and skirts it looks great.,pos
"I was so excited when i purchased this top! it was going to be my go to for running around, as it looked super cute with leggings and boots! the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamas.....so comfy! that all changed after one washing......it is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before! makes me sad, but it is going back!",neg
This shirt is like the best worn in flannel with a little feminine flair! super soft and great length.,pos
"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6""",pos
I love this dress. the fabric is creative...checked lace. the silhouette is figure flattering. work appropriate and can wear it for dinner with a change of shoes and jewelry.,pos
Usually red tops which are a true red are hard to find. this is more red in person that in the photo. great feel to material and the drape is wonderful. sometimes peplum tops can make me look bigger than i am (5'6 and 138 lbs) but this one has a nice slimming effect and the v-neck is complimentary to a smaller bust 36b. love it !!!!!!!,pos
"Fits just like on the model, even though im 5'4''. really happy with this casual summer find.",pos
"This sweater is perfect for cool days.  the fit is true to size, though a bit longer than in the photos, especially the sleeves (i'm petite).  i actually liked the length so did not order petite.  the sweater is a relatively soft cotton blend.  it is comfortable and the ruffle adds just the right amount of finesse.  the ruffle is stitched on all the way, so it doesn't open in front, which is a plus.  the blue grey is marled and more grey than blue.  the red is beautiful and as pictured.",pos
"I love the colors and pattern on this dress, and it's nice that it has a lining so no slip needed.  the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however, i'm pretty small up top, and the neckline comes pretty low, so i either have to wear my craziest push-up bra, or get the top altered. i haven't decided what my plan is yet, but will keep the dress for sure.",pos
"I have the raspberry jumper and i feel like royalty in it. the silk is luxurious and looks expensive. when i walk if feels like it is fluttering around me like butterflies around sleeping beauty. typically i am quite disappointed when trying a jumper and find that what looked amazing on the model simply makes me look goofy. but this one is the exception. i think the super long length (although problematic) as well as the soft elegant drape of he fabric, as well as the angled cut at the bodice ar",pos
"This tee is so comfortable and stylish. you can easily dress it up. i love how the back covers your assets, and the sleeves are long enough for tall girls. a great buy on sale! i bought a small and bought 3 colors!",pos
"I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.",pos
"I recently purchased this dress in the yellow, which is not advertised online, but glad i saw at the store because the color is vibrant but not too loud and really compliments my olive skin. the dress ran a little on the larger side so i had to size down. also, you will have to either wear a strapless bra or go without because you cant hide bra straps as this is more of a halter look. i'm 5'9"" and the length was perfect for me, will be able to wear with heels or flats.",pos
I went a size down on this top. it was to billowy in my regular size. it has the elastic waist but it was bunching up too much in that area. i love the embroidery. . it is gorgeous. . will have to hand wash for sure.,pos
This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.,pos
"I've been on the hunt for flattering cords for a long time, and these fit the bill! bought the silver on friday and am going to order the pink. the silver is really more taupe, as pictured, so if you're looking for true grey, this is not the pair for you. but the fit is fantastic. i'm 5'3"" athletic build about 130 lbs and the 27 fits perfectly. finally cords that don't make my muscular thighs look giant!",pos
"I love this sweater. hoping to order the other color. the weight of the sweater is perfect, not too heavy. i also really liked how the sweater lays with leggings because it is not bulky. great sleeve length.",pos
Excellent dress for lounging in the house or for sleeping. very comfortable and a little sexy at the same time.,pos

"I've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back. this one fits nicely--just a pretty, feminine, happy summer top that still lets me be leggy. i can't see them in the photos, but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots. very fun! i'm 5'5"" and when i paired this with jean shorts, everything below the crotch was visible--so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics.",pos
"I'm 5'7"" with a 36 b bra size and a size 4 fit perfectly and could not have been more comfortable. one big plus for me is that it is virtually wrinkle free. i purchased the orange which is a lovely muted orange, not neon or too bright and received multiple compliments when i wore it to work the first time.",pos
I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!,pos
"Although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned, it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft. i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra, i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry, but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist ...it is perfect! many compliments & the hem is so fun...also other reviews mentioned the bow",pos
"Love this top! love that it ia jersey knit which makes it comfortable. love the print which makes it stand out. love the design of a side bow. i did not have an issue with the banded hem, in fact i like how it makes the top more structured.",pos
"Received this jacket yesterday...and it is lovely.
very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.
the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online, was slightly disappointed with that, but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no ""oh she is wearing that jacket again""....
the forest green is rich and elegant.
the fit is true to size, but this is not a fitted jacket, it falls more straight, but the peplum is a gorgeous accent. 
a classic with impeccable quality!",pos
"I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good, though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu.

it's cotton with spandex incorporated, so it's soft and not stiff. it hugs your waist and accentuates your butt nicely. the lace up is unique in design, so it can be dressed up with a sparkle blouse or dressed casual in a t-shirt. i'm 5' 1"" in height so the length is very flattering and it zips up in the back. great color cream and excellent quality.",pos

This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.,pos

This is longer than i thought it would be- but again i'm petite! i ordered the grey and it's more of a grey green color that is absolutely beautiful. it is such a cute and easy top to wear!,pos
"This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair, they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so, that's why i gave it 4 stars for design.",pos

Simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots.  very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways.  i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i'm sure the regular would've been fine.  looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram.,pos
"This is my first pair of pilcro pants but defiantly not my last. i always have a hard time trying to decide between a regular length and a tall because at 5'10"" i usually fall somewhere in between. i ordered the regular length and couldn't b happier, they are just long enough to wear a shorter heal with or a pair of flats. the beige color is really nice and pairs nicely with the sky blue mock turtleneck sweater i also ordered from retailer. i love the retro 70's style too! i couldn't be happier wi",pos
"I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one.

my usual is 0 or 2, sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft, adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere, and i am a bit braod for my size.

i deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month *multiple purcahses) and this was one of 2 i had to pick... if it goes on sal",pos
"Les fauves is another version of last years larkhill swing dress but better.  one, the swing has less to swing, but in a good way!  they reduced the voluminous amount of material while retaining the fun swing aspect. two, the dress is shorter so it's more flattering to the vertically challenged like me. what's the same?  still wonderful silk, discreet pockets, beautiful abstract floral print and those horrid little buttons that are difficult to fasten on the back of a tight neckband collar.  i h",pos
"I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful. the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy. fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape. the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat. i'm short but the petite was well above my knee. i could have worn petite small just fine. it fit nicely in the bodice - the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist, but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais",pos
Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.,pos
The slubbed palette tee fits perfectly. it's very comfortable and looks cute with jeans. i'll be ordering more in other colors. i really like that its made in the us too.,pos
"Beautiful detail. sweater is warm, soft, and very comfortable. fits perfectly. i was worried without having seen it in person that the lace detailing would be fragile, but it is knitted into the underlying sweater material. i have worn it no less than five times already and not a flaw or a pull in it.",pos
"The fabric pattern is darling. i wore it in amsterdam and was told it looks like a traditional folk pattern. the dress is lightweight and is loose at the waist. sometimes i add a belt to cinch it in.

like another reviewer said, the buttons do pop off easily. i lost one at the cuff on the first day i wore the dress.",pos
"Sorry, but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large. as for sizing, i purchased my usual size small. the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy, and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust. love the high/low hemline, and the back isn't too tight across my bum. i'll also note that i'm 57 years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics. the see-through factor is not an issue with this buttondown. i'm",pos
These chinos are the best.  the fit is always true to size. the quality is great and the new fall colors are beautiful. my favorite are the plum. these are my go-to pants,pos
"Love these leggings!!! soft, cozy and yummy feeling! can't wait for the weather to get cooler! these fleece-lined leggings will be a new staple this winter!!!",pos
"This is my favorite dress purchase so far in 2016. the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful. it flares out a little but not too much. order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist, - or if you have broad shoulders, the larger of your typical size range. i'm typically a 00p or a 0p, with a 00p hip measurement, a middle range (00p is 24, 0p is 25) waist measument (24.5) and a 00p bust measurement, but my shoulders are broad and athletic. 0p, the larger",pos
I purchased my normal size small. i loved the colors in the purple which are more blue and vibrant red to me. this top is a nice soft fabric. it will pair nice with denim jeans.,pos
"I personally like light garment and simple design for my daily dresses.  it meets my needs.
i personally recommend it to customers.",pos
"Good quality, fit and length! love them:)",pos
Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!,neg
Dress really pretty and great quality. slip is small if large breasted.,pos
"This long sleeved tee is soft and beautiful. the swing design is so pretty and flattering. the seams along the front and back are a lovely addition. i also appreciate the higher neckline, which is increasingly hard to find in these kind of tees. would love it in more colors. i bought the black. i tried the white as well, but it was too transparent for this particular style and the tank top underneath gave it a sporty appearance. not horrible, but not what i wanted, so the white went back.",pos
"I bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months. it's so soft and cozy, i'm tempted to keep it! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist (belly button) and i've got a shorter torso and am 5'4.5"". i got this during the 40% sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price. a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night, more of a cab to curb piece.",pos
"Love this sweater! you can wear it with just about everything. i have worn it with dresses, leggings and jeans. you can dress it up or down. wonderful quality for the price.",pos
"I bought this awesome jumpsuit and i love it ! i really don't like wearing one piece clothing but this one its just so comfy and it looks great, i wear it with the straps or strapless and it looks different, as you can wear it classy or casual. and the best park, it has side pockets ! the color is as the description, navy blue and ivory/cream pattern. i wear a size 2. and that's what i got when i bought this, so pretty much to size for my  liking.",pos
"This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down",pos
"I have been looking for lace shorts for years. yes, years! finally found these shorts that are perfect. the lace is sturdy, not flimsy, so they are not see-through. i purchased both the cream and the blue when they went on sale. my skin is a bit tan, so lighter-colored clothing can be see-through for me. both colors are fantastic and i get compliments on them all the time, especially the blue shorts. plus, they complement either a t-shirt or a blouse. i love the eyelash fringe at the hem - such",pos
Love this top. the beautiful and delicate details are wonderful. the cut is a loose fit which is great. it works with tailored trousers and jeans,pos
I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco,pos
"I couldn't be happier with this top. it is very flattering and not at all shapeless as suggested by another reviewer...least not on me. yes the materiel is somewhat thin but it is advertised to be a tee shirt type material. that is why it feels so comfortable on with nice stretch and softness . i love the pleated back giving it neat detail and a added feminine touch. i ordered the dark purple color and it looks just like in the photo.
thanks retailer!!!!",pos
I was so afraid to get a too-small blazer (based on other reviews) that i ordered this two sizes up. i am usually a 0 or 2 in a blazer and ordered a 4. it was huge. i then ordered a 2 and it is just right. it's comfortable and chic and i love the blue and black combination.,pos
"This sweater is a beautiful, quality, well-made, piece of art! it looks on, exactly like it looks online. when i ordered it, i was worried that my usual size, xs, might be too tight. however, it is a perfect fit: it is fitted, yet, it still has a comfortable looseness (with some extra room in the length of the arms). for reference, i am 122 lbs, 5'4"", 36-17-36. the color is a perfect match to the pilcro serif navy/marin leggings. of course, i am always apprehensive about stretching and/or shrink",pos
Adorable skirt. thought the a-line and length were great. 5'4 and 135lbs. went up a size and it fit perfect. can dress it up or down. really happy with this wardrobe staple.  not too stiff denim of so moves well and feels comfortable.,pos
This dress was perfect for the fall/winter. i wish i would have bought more colors. the fabric is soft and clings just enough. i lived in it this winter.,pos
"I purchased this dress in my regular size xs. i'd come across it several times at my local store but never thought much of it to try it on. . when i saw it was on sale i decided to take a chance. boy was i surprised. the dress is really beautiful.. the hints of gold reflect nicely.. the dress is comfortable and loose yet flattering. i received so many compliments on it. i am 5'1"" and the regular length worked for me.",pos
This top was supposed to be 23 1/4 inches long in petite. it's actually 28 1/2 inches long.  it's also large in width. hard to believe it's an extra small petite.,neg
"I am not a fan of unlined bras, but this one was so pretty i had to try it. the lace doesn't look cheap, but overall i wouldn't have wanted to pay full price. it fits well and the support offers a nice shape (no cone!). i might go back for the other color.",pos
"I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress, but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift, and she was right. not worth the price on sale.",neg
This t shirt is very beautiful. i absolutely love it. it is soft and flattering and gorgeous - perfect for work or play. i washed it in gentle cycle cold water. i meant to hang to dry but somehow it got in the dryer with towels. i was heart sick when i saw it in a crumpled ball. but it did not shrink nor wrinkle. wow!,pos
"Great basic tank with a bit of a 'flair' at bottom that makes it super cute. will layer with cute bra most likely. the coral color is great, too. very pretty. i also got the white.",pos
"Like other reviewers, i did find that this jacket runs big. i am usually a size 2p or an xs and found an xxs in store and fits well. it'll be a great everyday-jacket!",pos
"These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.

you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?

these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li",pos
"Unique, sophisticated and versatile summer dress that you will fall in love with. dress it up with heels for a night at the gallery or dress is down with a denim jacket for an easy day look. it needs no accessories. this silk dress is soft and it lays beautifully. you will want to wear it all summer long. fits tts. love it!",pos
These pants feel great. fit is true to size. the blue color is very unique. definitely recommend!,pos
I've been looking for a new winter dress and this one fit the order! it's warm yet flattering and i love the color.,pos
"This blouse is romantic and timeless. the tonal print is lovely, the peplum cut flattering. i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up, which fits perfectly. it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on. i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight. thank you, retailer, for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath! perfect for warm climates.",pos
The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.,neg
"When i saw this item online, i ordered it right away. loved the color and the oversized, comfy look to it. the pros: very soft,the color a deep cranberry as pictured. the cons; the low back - in the photo, the model's arms cover it up. when i put it on, it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front -- and because the material is unstructured, that made it look worse. i loved it except for this one feature, but because it was so detracting, i had",neg
Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.,pos
"Great for work, great for play. i love this shirt. perfect length for tuck in or not.",pos
Just received this dress in the mail. it's stunning!! the lace is just beautiful. i ordered two sizes and had to size down a bit - the fit is generous. can't wait to wear this to my rehearsal dinner next week.,pos
"I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black, grey, blue, and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own, but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option.",pos
"I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.",neg
"Purchased this sweater in pink which is a beautiful blend of grey and pink. i purchased my usual size xs and it fits great through the shoulders, sleeves and body. i did try on a s and the body was too boxy. also, i tried a couple of different ones in my xs (along with other colors) and found them to run a little differently so you may want to check this out. the sweater is beautiful and easy to wear. the zipper adds a unique detail which can be unzipped part way to show a tank or just to draw a",pos
"These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :)
would highly recommend them.",pos
"I've been on the lookout for a great quality basic black and white stripe shirt. it's easy to find the super cheap ones that last you maybe four wears. this one is great quality, extremely soft, and comfortable. i'm usually a small in tops, but got this in a medium so that it would fit like the model, slightly loose, i didn't want it body hugging. so, if you're looking for that fit, go up a size, it doesn't stretch out much.",pos
"I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut, but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.",neg
Fabric is so comfy! color is gorgeous! fit is flattering for large chests.,pos
Tts. i'm wearing a small. the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants. washed nicely. layers flat to dry. had to iron the shell underneath. great for casual office.,pos
"Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.",pos
"This skirt has a beautiful style, cut and pattern. i am so surprised it is on sale - what a great price. it has a medium sweater knit that is not clingy and has a slight flair. looks great with boots!",pos
Love this. can be a jacket or blazer syle. fits well.,pos
"I got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants. they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic. i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame, but i had no problem with these at all. i may go after the other colors!",pos
"I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn't need it. on another visit, i tried again and couldn't resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition.",pos
This product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing,pos
"I've wondered abt this swtr but hesitated to order being it has dolman sleeves. decided to wait for it to come in at the local store. yesterday i spotted it in the store & tried on the orange, labeled 'red' online. i was really looking for the 'cream' but the store did not have it. well, the orange is really much prettier in person. fit is perfect in my usual size s. overall body fit & length is generous, sleeves are wrist length & i'm only 5'3"". most likely the sleeves will be shorter on taller",pos
"Took a chance without trying it on and ordered online...i love everything about this sweater!!! fit is on the spot, details are pretty and wonderful! try it, you won't be disappointed.",pos
This sweater caught my eye while in the store shopping for a gift. i am on the shorter size so i was worried that it would drown me. it didn't! it hits me mid thigh. the sides are cut up high. i will wear a cami or shirt under it. super soft material. flattering fit. i have put on a little weight and this hides all the problem areas without looking frumpy. thanks,pos
"This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model, but i am curvy and that's usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry!",pos
"I can't rate this with enough stars or numbers! great fit, can't see up the sleeve, perfect length, just right amount of fabric for draping. i am 5'3"" and 130lbs. fits like a dream and when i got it home from the store....it goes with all things in the closet!!! my one reservation is it only comes in one color. let's get on it designers! we need a lipstick red for summer and coral and navy and black and white. i don't need any other top! this one has great cool fabric and you don't need to wear",pos
I was tempted to get this online but just wasn't sure i wanted to buy even with the sale because i only wear dresses to the knee and didn't know how this would look with leggings or jeans. i tried it on in the store the next day and it was so cute! there are long skinny black tassels in the front that you can't really see in the online pics that i love. it looks great with my skinny jeans with tears or black leggings and boots. i even have some cute leggings just past the knee that this looks aw,pos

"Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldn't be happier! it's stunning! not sheer at all, but light and breezy. i typically wear a medium, sometimes a small, but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me. this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i've been looking for all spring. the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue. a perfect find!",pos
I had been looking for this dress in xs. the small ran large on me and xs had sold out online. i'd been searching for it calling every store around and not having any luck.. when allison called me from store 428 highland village in houston.. she had found the dress for me in the woodlands.. i was able to purchase it and i can't wait to get it.. it will be perfect for the hot summer here in texas. thank you allison for such great customer service and retailer for employing such great staff.,pos

I get nervous ordering clothes online but that was my only option for this dress. i love everything about this dress and i love the pockets.,pos
Awesome top. slightly cropped. great to dress up jeans or wear with pants or skirt for evening out.,pos

This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back.,pos
"Not usually one for a turtleneck, even a mock turtleneck, but this so soft and did not fit super tight around the neck so i bought it. then i bought the other one because i loved it so much. my only gripe is that i wish it was a smidge longer. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic build, 34c and the small fit perfect.",pos

"I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit.",neg
I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.,pos
Oh i simply can't say enough about this dress... it's just so pretty! i've sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress. it's a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft. really flattering. you can dress it up or down as well - i'm glad i'll be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket.,pos
I bought this in black and the checkered pattern. love both. very floaty and feminine. fits true to size.,pos
"I just purchased this dress yesterday in the navy for my anniversary next month. i have to say its totally stunning on. the embroidery is beautiful, extremely figure flattering and the dress is very well constructed. i have to disagree with other reviews who say it doesn't or won't work for bustier women. i am a 34 d, 5'8"" tall and normally wear a size 4. the 4 fits perfectly and the deep v-like neckline creates a very nice bit of cleavage. maybe too much for some at the office i would say, but",pos
"This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.",pos
This dress has all the hallmarks of a classic. the fit of the bodice is form enhancing but modest and the flare is very feminine and swingy. i love the soft denim fabric though it smelled funny out of the package and i had to air it out. i am 140# 36dd and bought the size 8.,pos
This is a beautiful dress. the embroidery is really lovely in person. i find that this brand runs a bit small usually. i am usually an 8 but had to go up to a 10 to fit my hips. i am a little bit pear shaped so that might be why.,pos
"These are amazing quality. i agree, size up to not have such a sheer effect. i would not wear them as just leggings without a long shirt covering the butt.

they are warm. i wore them under some ski stuff. kept me warm.

i also washed them on handwash cycle. seemed to be ok.",pos
I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.,pos
"Love this top! got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans, shorts, crops...some say it's a little short and boxy. while the style is cut larger, i wouldn't call it boxy and i definitely didn't find it to run short. a great staple, wish it came in other colors besides white and black/gray.",pos

I am a petite person with broad shoulders and got this in a size small. i absolutely love it! it is similar to how it looks online but is even better in person. you could wear this with just about anything. so glad i bought it.,pos
"These pants are amazing! i usually have a hard time finding ones to fit me due to my small size (5'1"" 100 lbs) but the 0 fit me perfectly. they are not too tight, just slim enough without clinging to you like a second skin. love the length , hits just above the ankle bone. versatile and comfortable. however, if i were any heavier, i cannot say these pants would work. i am fairly thin, in most cases i would size up.",pos
This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.,pos
"Absolutely adore this jacket. i'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect. the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be. so perfect and beautiful, the embroidery is gorgeous, i feel so feminine in this coat",pos
"This top runs large. i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review, i ordered a small, and it was the right decision. i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso. love the back detail and the print and color is really nice!",pos
"This is a great skirt to add to your closet. i love it. it is comfortable, soft, and has detail to it. i enjoy wearing it for work or a night out.",pos
"It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy, but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it, but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.",pos
Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.,pos

"As others mentioned, the arm holes are a bit large- but i didn't find this too much of a problem. possibly that's because as a smaller chested woman i run into that issue regularly. i'm 5' 4"" 130 and the size 8 fit perfectly. the length is at the top of knee.",pos
"Like other reviewers, i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well, i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo, although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high, the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms), and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small, which is what",neg
Love these jeans! flattering and comfortable!! great length for short girl!! worth the money!,pos
Very cute!! true to size,pos
"I desperately needed some new work clothes, so i ordered this and a few other shirts online. this was the only one that fit me really well and that i really liked! it's a bit pricey for a tanktop, but it feels really well made. the material is soft and comfortable and the ruffle details and the print are beautiful. the small fits me perfectly (5'7"", 150 lbs, 36a) and it's not short like a lot of other shirts i try on, (which my coworkers probably appreciate since no one wants to see me flashing",pos
"I love these pants. i vary between 10 & 12, the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size, perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom. so many colors to coordinate with these pants. teal green, ""retailer"" yellow, black...i am not fond of ankle pants, prefer longer pants. i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants. the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made, removing the cuff tacks was a challenge! perfect pants for those of us who have shape",pos
"I'm in love with this top! looks just like it does in the photos, except the colors are maybe a little more vibrant. it's definitely boxy, so you may not like it if boxy isn't your thing, but i think the pattern placement really works with the boxy shape. i usually wear a small in tops and the xs/s fits great. it's also machine wash and tumble dry which is a plus (although i haven't washed it yet). unique, chic, and effortless...order before it's gone!",pos
"These got me so excited for fall. the teal is a color i'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these. when they arrived though, i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch. the fit is snug, but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable! these will be a staple in my wardrobe. i want to order more colors!",pos
"The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect. however, the fabric, despite 2% spandex, has absolutely no give from the knee down. the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch. while i was able to pull them on (size 27 for 110 lb/5.4'), i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably. with longer wear, i think they would cut off the circulation.

please post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer.",neg
"This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable. i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length ,even though i got the regular and not the petite.",pos
"I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it, it's the cutest suit ever.",pos
"This suit did nothing for me. the top has zero support. this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested. also, the top gapped in the center. it just did not fit right. the top is very thin showing everything. a light padding would make a big difference in this suit. also i could not get a good fit. as i tightened the top, the back would ride up. the bottoms are ok. not renatkable",neg
"I love this top. i've washed it a couple of times now and i can say it holds pretty well unlike what another reviewer said. it's very good quality, for me it is true to size, i'm 5'2, 127lbs, 36b and the small was perfect. i wear it with a strapless bra. overall, a great purchase that i can pair with almost anything.",pos
"This top is way more sparkly and festive in person. i plan to pair it with black or charcoal gray pants for a holiday party, but it would also go great with dark jeans. it is super cute, can't wait to wear it.",pos
"I wasn't sure about this top online. in the picture, it sort of looks like it juts out after the tie. but the reviews said it was really soft and flattering on. i wasn't sure exactly how the sizing translated (numbers vs letters), so i ventured into the store. i am normally either an xxs or xs in most retailer tops. i went with size 2. i think i would have been ok in the 0, but it might have gotten a bit snug in the shoulder area sizing down. and with the front tie, it can be cinched in to create",pos
I bought this top for my daughter and it looks beautiful. it's a pretty jade green color and has a nice flow to it. the back is very flattering as well.,pos
"The quality of the fabric is good, but the fit is horrible. unflattering and strange. definitely a pass.",neg
"This top is a must have for summer. it is light and accentuates the figure. i'm 5'3 and many tops overwhelm me, but this is shorter in the front and a touch longer in the back. the cotton is very nice and it has a somewhat wider hem. if you have hips this somehow makes them look narrower.
if they had additional colors, i would have bought them all. i'm a 36c and the size 8 was perfect.",pos
"I was excited to see this top, ordered it and was disappointed. it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom. i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck.",neg
"I ordered this dress online. the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small, particularly in the waist. i normally wear a 0 or 2, but i ordered the 4. it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a 34c. i liked the look, but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric. additionally, the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out. i returned it immediately.",neg
The picture doesn't do it justice. i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing. the fit is true to size. i am large chested but it fit comfortable...i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest. still looks amazing. i feel very feminine in this blouse. good quality material.,pos
"This sweater fits differently than it looks on the model in the photo. it is more fitted, less bell sleeve. and the neck is less boat-neck on me. i am often between sizes at retailer, but in this one i got the larger size and it fits well. i love this sweater. i just wanted to mention that i think it fits differently than what it looks like in the pic.",pos
"I highly recommend this dress! it is super flattering and i got so many compliments. it fits like a glove and honestly made me look 10 lbs thinner. very romantic and has great movement. the length is perfect, since the top is quite modest, it's nice that it's on the shorter side - makes it a little flirty! i wasn't sure of the pattern at first, but it fit so perfectly that i overlooked it and bought it anyway. by the end of the night i was in love with the pattern. it really stood out and i can'",pos
This is such a cute jumper! i bought it to wear to a beach wedding. i took a chance trying on a medium (i'm a true large) and was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit! very excited to add this to my spring/summer repertoire!,pos
"This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture. the colors are soft and feminine. medium fit me perfectly. this is the soft, cuddly sweater i have been looking for.",pos
"I love this sweater coat! the buttons make it more structured and practical when the weather is cool.
the colors are even nicer in person; the neutral yellow is sure to compliment a lot.
you would be disappointed with this purchase.",pos
I'm very disappointed in the quality. it seems more like a pajama than a tunic. definitely not worth 100.00 dollars. i plan to return it.,neg
"I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty, beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it",neg
"This top is much more beautiful in person than in the photo. the embroidery is exquisite and there is the tiniest bit of sparkle amidst the design. soft, flowing and flattering. definitely a keeper.",pos
"Got this shirt on sale and i hope they restock so i can buy more. super comfy and flattering at the same time. i have some extra baby weight and it camouflages that well. i'm normally a 6-8 but i'm an 8-10 right now and the medium was perfect. i'm 5'6"" and its plenty long enough to wear with leggings. a great shirt and i'll be sure to watch out for this one to come back. please restock!",pos
"Gorgeous color and great price, but too low cut and because of the design, a cami's wouldn't work. disappointed",neg
"Despite being a knit, this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.",pos
"I tried this one twice, in the same day, the first time, i didn't like it, the stylist in the dressing room at the time dind't etiher, but then my favorite stylist finally showed up (:-) ) and i tried it on again, but at the time, had changed pants... made all the difference. you really need hte right pants for htis, but it is gorgeous.

i bought hte black color online, i liked it better, the white has stell colored polka dots, so if you want more of a spring color, also good for you.

style: ca",pos
"The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.",neg
I love these! they are so soft! the high waist is awesome and fits like a glove. they don't stretch out. i wear with a heel and get tons of compliments. they make my hips look smaller than they are.,pos
"I walked into a local retailer store and saw these pants. talk about love at first sight. they have an amazing look and fit! usually, i have to buy petite-sized pants, but the length fit at my ankle, and i like the look better than what is shown. since it is still summer, i paired the pants with a cute white tank and black flip flops, but can't wait to mix it up with a cute bootie and sweater.",pos
This dress fits perfectly and is travels wonderfully through the seasons! the color and cut is really flattering and flows nicely!,pos
"Pilcro is an incredible denim brand and i've never been disappointed. these are no exception. minimal distress, perfect length (i'm 5'8 and they hit just like the model), great color and super comfy! they have some stretch to them and definitely fit baggier, so depending on how you want them to fit...i sized down for a snugger fit. these are fantastic!",pos
"This top is super cute, nice and light for the hot weather, with a tts fit. the model is wearing a light-colored bra, so it shows through. but, with a black bra, there is no problem.",pos
"Disappointing, back is yellowish and looks strange. the front view is cute but doesn't match the fabric on the back at all. can't imagine why you would do that?",neg
"Love this dress. from the great fabric (soft yet substantial) that's similar to sweater material, to the amazing detail of the flower design (it's really so unique and i mean that in a good way!), to the color (a tan with gold flecking), and lastly to the really flattering fit, not to mention those retro bell sleeves!  all around a fun dress! it was true to size and not too short, hitting my 5'4"" height about 2"" above my knees.",pos
"This is such a gorgeous shade of indigo! i was instantly attracted to it! upon trying on, i was surprised at how soft the fabric was. definitely a cozy sweatshirt feel in disguise! i love the peplum detailing and found the xs to be just right in length to my hip and everywhere else! i can't wait for it to cool off here in new england so i can wear this beautiful top!! i anticipate many compliments on s lovely top!!",pos
"I love this item! . they hang & flow beautifully like the weightlessness of a silk skirt.
the front peek-a-boo cut outs really make them a delight to wear & show off some skin!
somewhat transparent,i topped it off with a lightweight tunic length for modesty... but the placement of the painterly design really works in my favor so i could wear them with something shorter if i choose to. (like the model)
heads turned as i walked by!",pos
"I've never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount. still painful but hopeful it would be worth it. i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length. and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay. while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side, so the garment flows nicely, it's not. the weight of the sweater is substantial, heavier and much thicker than it looks. the color is different too. it's tan and grey, not whi",neg
"This dress is really beautiful. i was looking for something to wear to a summer 6 o'clock wedding, and this dress will work perfectly. the fabric is smooth and has a tiny bit of sheen to it which makes it look a little nicer and more formal. however, you can easily dress it down. my only issue was the length. i'm 5'4 and this dress was way too long. definitely need to take off about 5 or 6 inches! i also had to size up. i could have tried the petite, but it fit so well everywhere except length,",pos
"I usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue.  i am 5'2"", 120#, broad shoulders.  i ordered both the sp & the mp.  i tried on the small petite first and it was too tight in the shoulders/arm (that was without lifting my arms forward or up).  i tried on the mp and it was perfect!  i would have to say this is my favorite fall top so far!  the color is very pretty . . .more of a lavender than pink.  the lace detail is delicate and pretty.  the top is more like a tunic, get the petite if you short",pos
"I purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit. i love the top, and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style. alas, the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough. even though these are very comfortable leggings, i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue.",pos
Super soft flannel material. the colors are beautiful and perfect for fall! it's doesn't ride up the shoulders but stays in place off-the-shoulder style. i love it!,pos
The picture doesn't do this blouse any justice. the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse. the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop!,pos
"Love the contrast of fabrics, thick and thin. comfy like a favorite sweatshirt but with style. can be worn both, on a night out or curled up on the sofa watching a movie at home.",pos
Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.,neg
"This dress is beautiful and unique - the cutouts and lace really stand out. however, the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers. i usually get a 0 or 0p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the 0 regular was huge and the armholes really big. the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short. while the design is beautiful, there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling. for reference, i am 24 waist",neg
"I am not usually one for super girly tops, but i could not resist this top. the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down, i think it is extremely versatile. it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it's perfect! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a 2 in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders. but if you size up you should be perfect! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out!",pos
"This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous,with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a ""life ""in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or,i better say, it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately, it stretched more than a full size, and generally lost its shape. now, the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore.",neg
I got this sweater in navy and it is much cuter than online! it is a great transition sweater and also i can see it used on cool nights at the beach. i have worn in professional environment to work as well as with a tee and jeans. i love it!,pos
"Retailer has the greatest pencil skirts. i usually get 1 every year. the pattern on this one makes it very eye catching with blue birds on green or tan background and black and white flowers in a tree pattern. so it is versatile to wear with many colored tops.
i bought a large because they didn't have medium in the store. it is a bit loose in the waist but comfortable . the rest fits nice and slim. i am usually an 8-10 in jeans.",pos
"I took advantage of the sale this weekend & purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase. it's so soft, fits tts & i just can't wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it!",pos
"Yay, i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! it's perfect for casual day-to-day stuff, as well as summer festivals, nights out, travel, etc. i love the design, length and fit. it's a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice, but in a very casual, appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages, it's flattering for us curvier ladies,",pos
"Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt, jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.",pos
"This dress is gorgeous. flattering, comfortable, and machine washable!

for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 and 34dd. i got the medium and it fits great! only flaw is that the armholes are a little large, but not enough that my bra shows so i am okay with it.",pos
"Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments. the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size. i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe, but it was not a deal breaker. loved that it was lined and, though feeling substantial, was not heavy and thus comfortable in 90 degree weather. looking forward to wearing this again.",pos
"This is the softest cardigan i own. perfect for lounging, going to / from yoga or dressing it up with a statement piece or a scarf. i've worn it buttoned or open, and receive many compliments. i have it hanging on the inside of my closet door because i wear it more than anything else at the moment : )",pos
"This dress is beautiful and timeless. i wore it to a wedding and received so many compliments. i love how i can also wear it to so many other engagements. i plan to wear it for mother's day brunch, a friend's wedding shower, and know that the clasic cut will be a staple in my closet for years to come. the quality is what you expect for the price and is well worth your investment.",pos
"I love eva franco 
this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled 
felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.",neg
"I love these pilcro pants. i had them in two colors, both beige and khaki. super comfy, and they stretch out a little around the waist with wearing. however, i recently ruined both sets in the wash because i used a stain-stick remover to try to get some grease spots out of them. the stain stick instead lifted the dye off of them! now i have two sets of pants with odd light splotches on them...so sad they aren't more color-fast :(",pos
"Just bought this and am in love with it. it's a really nice weight - light for spring. the drape-y fit is very flattering. it's longer in the back than in the front and has a nice swing to it. can't wait to wear it!

i tried on the tee in the lighter color and didn't care for it much - i liked the contrast of the black and silver stripes.",pos
These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.,pos
Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.,pos
"If you've been an retailer lover for awhile, you have at least one of the left of center thermals. every single year they come out with them and they are best sellers - so when i saw this is couldn't believe it!!! it's just like the left of center thermal shirt, but a cardigan! soft, warm but thin enough that it would be a perfect layer for the summer. be warned that this fabric does grow with wear. definitely size down a bit. the body is full and the sleeves are fitted. lots of stretch and very v",pos
"The skirt is comfortable and as pictured. it also ran tts. i'm 5'5"" tall and weigh 140 lbs. i had the medium and didn't need to size up to a large. when you put the skirt on a normal body, it looks like you are wearing an easter egg... and not in a good way.",neg
"I promised myself only one pair of joggers this year, and these were the ones i went with (in the blue motif). for me the tipping point was the quality and fit of these were far superior than the others i tried, while still being machine washable. the fabric has aa little substance, yet is still lightweight and comfortable. the fit has a perfect bit of tailoring/tapering to be ultra-flattering while having the comfort of pajama pants. the blue motif is adorable too - love the geometric shapes. l",pos
"I love this blouse because it's great for work with cardigan over it, and great for going out with skirt, pants or jeans. it is tts and very flattering, light weight, and comfortable.",pos
"Amazing style, great fabric and a dress for all occasions. bought the black and love it!",pos
"I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. the dress falls just below my knees, perfect for the colder weather! i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much! the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable. i continue to find maeve dresses classic, quality, flattering and comfortable!",pos
"I ordered this blazer so i could look more put-together for work, but still feel comfortable. it checks both of those boxes, (it's almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure) and has a great cut/style. my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes, but the white part is actually a light heathered gray. i think i would have preferred white, but i still like it enough to keep. got my normal size small, which fit great.",pos
"Oh such a classic retailer look for summer! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric. i was immediately drawn to it. but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist, creating the look of an apron. yes. it looks like one is wearing a full apron. or scrub dress. 
why?? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo.",neg
"This sweater is soft and comfortable. it's the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and in winter can be easily layered. at 4'11 it's a little large and could have sized down to an extra small petite, but still love it.",pos
"The design is very strange. the inner slip is quite form-fitting, but the dress on top was just massive, like a sack. on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with. they looked weird just hanging off the side, so i tried to knot them like a belt. overall, this dress was not attractive on. it looks much better on the model. the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life, harsher red, blue, and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured.",neg
"This dress is short, but super flattering.  i was surprised when i tried it on in-store that i liked it as much as i did!  the lace detail around the neck is unique and beautiful.  i'm 135, 5'8"", 32dd and the small fits perfectly.  it's easy to wear and can be dressed down with tights and boots, or dressed up.",pos
"One in every fifteen items of retailer clothing fits. this jacket is one. easy to grab and keep chill away. hood snuggles up as cozy collar when not worn up. model in photo must have orangutan arms, sleeves hit at wrist on this wearer with shortish arms.

boiled wool fabric is light, which is great for layering. lovely transition fall to winter transition piece. statement jacket that will live on next season and beyond.

thank you, rosie neira.",pos

"Thanks to the vertical stripes, the adjustable neckline, the bow that cinches the waist, and the free flowing skirt, this dress is extremely flattering. the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips. i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist, but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me (i just",pos

cut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.

color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but can't go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.

ruffle is a great addition too...",pos

"I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple.. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever! i let my sisters try it on too, to see if they wanted it or liked it better, but it was awful on them as well. i ordered the xs in blue. it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering. i am 5'7' and 115. i love swing dresses,i just don't think is cut well.",neg
"I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints, i think it's a lot of fun. not so fun to put on, but it's worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p, but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much.",pos
"This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer, but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt, or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey, which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!",pos
"I got the top in green, it is very soft and comfy. it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt.",pos
I have 3 pairs of these chinos i love them so much. they come soft like a well-worn favorite but are high quality at a great price. i'm typically a size 4. i bought the 26 size but think i could have gone down to a 25. otherwise very happy with this purchase!,pos
"These are the cutest pants ever. they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for spring/summer. sadly, i have to return them because they are huge. i generally wear an xs in retailer, and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants. i wish they made an xxs. if you size down at least one size, they are adorable!",pos
Great dress. fits perfectly. will be perfect in the winter and with leggings.,pos
So beautiful! i got the xs and it fits tts! it goes with everything! perfect weekend addition!,pos
"This is so ridiculously soft and conformable. it can be worn over workout clothes, or with skinnies or leggings. it looks fabulous either way. i wear mine the way the customer photo #2 is shown: meaning, folded over. but it looks great either way. the green is such a nice neutral: it looks great with black or shades of brown, tan, or even grey. the functional pockets are such a nice touch.

"I normally wear a size 27, but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size 26 and so i went with a size 26 for this purchase. they fit perfectly. i would have liked to order the petite, but it did not appear to be an option. the fabric is very soft and stretchy. they are little loose around the ankle, but i have very skinny calves and ankles, so that is not so surprising. the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything. i would buy these in other colors.",pos
"This dress is beautifully made, but it does not flair slightly as in the photo, it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture.",neg

This is a great looking top in person. i've worn this with jeans or skirts for different looks and it's cute both ways. i would order a size up though as it is not a flexible fabric so the shoulders/chest area need a little room to move comfortably.,pos
"I received this dress as a birthday gift and am completely in love with it! there are some things about it that i wish i'd known (but are by no means deal breakers!). first, you can kind of see this in the model shot, the keyhole neckline is not sewn shut at all - it's completely open. it didn't cause problems for me, but some women may not be comfortable with that. my dress didn't have any zippers and so was a pullover. the band that runs around the waist has little to no stretch, so you have t",pos
I bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaid..this is true to size and adorable! i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge. adorable detailing on back and on shoulders...its a keeper!,pos
"I wanted to love this sweater. the color is gorgeous, the pattern unusual, it is soft and warm, and would have gone with so many things. but the cut is awful. mainly the sleeves are way too big, making me look misshapen and my arms look huge. the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal. too bad.",neg
"I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern, the feel, and the fit. comfortable, fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available, but am perfectly happy with the regular length.",pos
What a sweet shirt!! the ski pattern is adorable and they have a cute cat pattern that i've only seen so far in the store. the fit is small. i sized up from my normal 8 to a 10 but could have even gone to a 12 as there wasn't much difference between the 10 and the 12 except in length.,pos
Can't wait to wear this during the holidays. beautiful embroidery and detailing.,pos
Great transitional top.  comfy and great fit.  i like my tops to be somewhat roomy and this was great in a small.  i usually buy medium.,pos
"Finally a ""swing top"" that doesn't look like a sack on me! i've been wanting to partake of this current style, but everything i've tried so far just looks ""dumpy"" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5'7"" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a ""swing"" style, it still shows my waist and doesn't overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i'm thinking of going back for more colors!",pos
It's really not in my typical wheelhouse. i took a chance based on reviews. the shorts are long and roomy enough. and i love it with the long-sleeves. i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would. i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point. that's a bummer.,pos
"A swing top by tiny done right. this is a well made top that fits in all the right places, no gapping arm pit! the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year. the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size, you may have to go down two sizes. i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect. it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother.",pos
"Soft, lightweight, comfortable. i wore this as soon as i got it and have received many compliments on the style and color. super soft, love the angled zipper and sleeve length is long enough to be comfortable. great cool weather jacket.",pos
Most often complimented item of this spring's wardrobe,pos
"This yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person. i actually don't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow, but i couldn't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect! the silhouette is very feminine, especially around the neckline & shoulders. there is a lot of fabric, but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive. finally, the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it. looking forward to summer!",pos
"I love the flowy-beachy look of this jumpsuit, it is very comfortable, and super cute, my only ""gripe"" is that the hip part is pretty wide, hands in the pockets, you can't tell, but if i were to get this, i would want a xxs. length was ok not petite since it is a flowy look. colors are very nice too, kind of ""70's"", but i love it. i think i will get this if it goes to sale, even if it is a little big on me... i am 115 lbs, 30d chest and tried on xs.",pos
"These pants are a must for any girl's summer warm weather wardrobe! i tried them on in the store and loved them. but... i am just over 5' and they were too long in the xs, even with 2.5 inch heels. so i ordered them in an xs petite and they are perfect with my 2.5-3 inch heels. 
i love that they are wide-legged! they look cool and are flattering! i am a teacher and plan on wearing them to work during the warmer months with a nice solid tee and a statement necklace. and of course, heels. i highl",pos
"I debated getting this top, and i am glad that i did! i got the pink, and it is a fun, vibrant color. someone suggested that if you are in between sizes, go up. i agree with that feeling; however, it is pretty true to size. it is preppy, cute, and classic.",pos
"Way too much fabric; sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip - eek! might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric, but the extra fabric just piles up on itself... the outer layer also doesn't feel like it will breath. add the cotton lining, and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer. returning.",neg
"This dress is truly a no brainer purchase! it is a stunning dress with gorgeous embroidery, beading and  the color is just perfect for fall! i am only 5'2 and i went with the regular size since i don't like to go too short. that said, you can totally rock this dress with leggings and boots if it is too short. i weigh 103 lbs and i am normally an xxs but i'm glad i went with the xs since it would have been too tight at the top and should even  be slightly loose fitting on the bottom. love everyth",pos
"I am really impressed with the workmanship of this jacket as well as the ""fit."" it really does fit me well and has a ""cool"" look. the quality is really worth the price. thank you retailer!!",pos
I love the dress!  i purchased this dress to wear on my honeymoon to paris.  it made me feel like a princess walking around the gardens of versalles while wearing it!,pos
"Was scared at first to order this product, when i tried it on i was amazed on how good it looks. fits just like the model picture, and the material is awesome.",pos
"Love, love, love. like another chambray item i have, they feel stuff and rough after washing, but once you put them on, they soften up and look great.",pos
"Usually wear a small, sometimes medium. bought this in medium and am very happy with it. form-fitting but not too tight. would probably fit well in a small, if i was in better shape. it does show any flaws, so the medium is more forgiving. bought the black and am considering the neutral stripe. this is a great, medium weight top for cooler days. the snap collar looks nice open. i plan on washing on delicate and hanging up to dry. i never dry clean anything except wool suits and coats.",pos
This is a pretty blouse but everything else you wear with it needs to be sharp because it can be dowdy otherwise.,pos
Wish i would have bought them in every color. love,pos
"I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception. i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasn't sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online, but the print is beautiful. it's a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest. i like that it has enough coverage at the top (front and back), the underarms do not fall very low, and it is lined. the a-line skirt will flatter most body types. the fabric and overall q",pos
"I purchased this in london, early april, and i wore it to a summer wedding. it was perfect and hangs very nicely. the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture. the front slit goes up to about the knee but doesn't split apart when walking which i appreciated. the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves. i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve. a definite keep",pos
"Super cute, great for a casual summer day. fabric is nice and light and honey color goes well with denim, kaki  or olive green. runs a little large but still looks good especially with fitted jeans or capri pants.",pos
"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs, and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it drapes well. because i am petite, the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately, the petite xs is sold out, so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti",pos
"Love this. it's heavy/warm, stylish and a great throw on any outfit. oversized style.",pos
"I like the light fabric and embroidery on a otherwise hard look (bomber). feminine can be worn casually with jeans and a t-shirt, or over a dress. lovely on every note. fit: i ordered botih the xxs p and xsp. (had tried on regular xs in store) tried on the xxsp first and kept it (didn't try on xs p). since the fit is loose (bomber) on me i like it a little more fitted. there is enough room for a sweater. 

i am 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist. arms were not too snug either...",pos
"I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.",neg
"I tried this skirt on in a size medium. i am usually a small (4-6, 39 inches around the hips and butt) but there were no size smalls. the medium looked good but the waistline may have been a tad loose. the texture of the skirt is wonderful and it is lined! overall, the quality seemed good and it had a nice heft to it. the only thing i might say is that is is quite long--closer to my ankles and i'm just shy of 5' 9"" and leggy to boot (i wear a 33"" inseam with flats). with tall boots on, you saw j",pos
"I really like this dress/shirt. it's great for layering, super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year's pregnancy weight gain. i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots.

unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size. this may sound weird but i've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward didn't change between the two sizes. i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back.",neg
"Beautiful dress, but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!",neg
"I've always had great difficulty finding a pair of shorts that i like the fit of - most are either too short, too thin, too low, or too tight. i have athletic legs that ""mainstream"" fit doesn't work well with, for the most part.

fortunately, that was not the case with the neda shorts. i was first drawn to them because of the striking but subtle pattern - and they also fit well, with a good length and a structured fit. they have a medium-high waistband and a slight stretchiness, and the fabric",pos

"I've been looking for a leather or faux leather jacket for years and years and this is the first one that i've ever loved so much! the style is edgy and modern, yet still feminine and flattering. love the cut of the jacket, so flattering! looks amazing with dresses, skirts or denim. i got the dark red color, and it's much more brown and neutral than it appears online. i would love to get the tan color as well, but it's currently sold out in my size. the faux leather looks believable and expensiv",pos
"Absolutely love this sweater because it is so pretty while being soft and comfortable. i am 5'4"" and purchased the small?it falls a little below my hips. while the color matches everything, the pockets and details add a nice touch and the longer sleeves are cozy. the only drawback is it pills and sheds.",pos
"This is huge. i understand that's the style, but it looked like i was wearing my husband's size xxl. i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice... but then it started to itch, and itch and itch!",neg
I love this dress. i didn't think that i would feel at ease as it is very form-fitting. but it is so comfortable! and warm. it is dressy yet casual. i have received many compliments.,pos
Very nice long-sleeved shirt. the fabric is soft and warm. you can wear it on its own or easily compliment with a jacket.,pos
"The xs was too large on me and i'm not a tiny person. while the dress was beautiful on the model, in person it had way too much fabric and fit rather tent-like. the fabric is gorgeous and the dress would have worked if it were more of a fitted style and had half the amount of fabric on the bottom. not flattering at all.",neg
"This is a really well made, great looking blouse. the details are charming. i like that it is a good weight, not too sheer. the 3/4 sleeves are perfect. i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall. so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try. it's a keeper!",pos
As soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it. like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath. it does run large but that's my style. i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties. can be dressed up or down. highly recommend :),pos
"This is such a lovely dress -- and it looks great on! like other customers, i like the petal hem and the top part, which is stretchy, is soft and not clingy.
 
i think the only drawback is that the color isn't as rich a green as it looks in the pic. i've attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposes.

i'll be wearing this way into the fall!",pos
I love this unique shirt!  the only thing is is is really wide like a babydoll top fit.  i tucked mine into skinny jeans,pos
"I was really looking forward to this dress. i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture. it came wrinkled, but i think even pressed it would fall weird. the side swoop falls funny, and you can see the seams underneath. and the top front falls funny, not quite sure what to do with it. it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down. again, maybe if you get it pressed that would be better. the back is still beautiful though. i'm 5'3"" 115lbs ordered a 0.  maybe on someone talle",neg
Love the shirt! fits great and is so cute! a must have for fall!,pos
I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!,pos
"This is a beautiful, high-quality little black dress. it actually has a little weight to it, but nothing bothersome. i usually take a medium across the board, but i had to size up to a large. this is dress has more of a straight line versus a-line and i have wider hips, so the large fit really good. it's beautiful and versatile. i just wore it to my high school reunion and got compliments : ) great purchase, i would highly recommend.",pos
"I saw this dress in the store tried it on and , love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14), plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun",pos
This shirt is simply pretty. it's light and dresses up a distressed pair of jeans.,pos
"I added this to my cart on a whim, and what a nice surprise! the color is gorgeous--this dark plum color is a great alternative to grey, black, or brown. i'm planning to wear it first with a cream sweater, a mustard colored scarf, and a brown leather jacket. i am a pear-shape, and this skirt works very well to structure (and minimize!) my bottom half. it also isn't as short as i thought it might be--although i, like the previous reviewer, plan to wear this with tights and boots. the only negativ",pos
"My 3 daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between 5'2 and 5'10 . this dress was sloppy on every one of us. i don't think a size x small would have made a difference. the length is all over the place .i""m not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture. on the positive side was very soft. it may work as a beach cover -up.",neg
"This is the perfect simple tank for summer. not clingy, and hangs really nicely, but not so billowy that you can't layer a nice wrap or cardigan over it. fabric feels like a great quality. i got it in white, and it's a bit sheer, but i typically layer my tanks anyway. tempted to get this in every color!",pos
"I bought this in both colors,for it is perfect for me.it looks great with jeans and then dress it up later with pants.this is why i love retailer!",pos
I love this sweater! i tried it on at the store and had to purchase! it's even cuter on! i am normally between a small and a medium but decided on the small as it has a loose look. perfect weight for summer!,pos
"This top is beautifully constructed, fits true to size i ordered a medium - the armholes are nicely cut - not too loose will be able to wear with a racer back bra, accommodates my larger bust 34dd.",pos
Great trouser pants for summer with pretty jacquard print and neat denim detail at hem and waist band. usually wear a 6 in retailer but went up a size to 8 with these for looser trouser fit. fits my backend nicely which is always a plus. can't wait to wear them!,pos
"I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.

great buy",pos
"The only problem with this top is that it only comes in two colors.  this is a lightweight easy to wear top that surprises you with the cute design details.  it will be easy to wear in the heat of my hometown.  i don't think it is too thin and i won't need to add a camisole.  i am 5'2"" and weigh 120 and i got a small.  perfect.",pos
Poor quality. i expected much more from the material.,neg
"This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton, which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3"", 117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok, so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips, but arms were bagg",pos
Great color fit was very true to size,pos
"This shirt runs large, so order down a size. it is comfortable, cute and great for transitioning from summer into fall. adding jewelry really dresses this top up. can't wait to layer it with kimono, vest, pashminas or wraps. great with sandals or boots. glad i bought both colors. it looks much better on, than in the photo/on hanger. great purchase and can't wait to wear!",pos
Great light weight sweater. perfect for spring. runs true to size. definitely will buy another color.,pos
"I love this dress! i spotted it in the store yesterday right before walking out. i almost missed it! i'm so glad that i didn't because this dress is super cute. the fit is nice too. not too short. the fringe detailing is very cool. i cannot wait to wear this dress this spring/summer. casual enough for flip flops, but could also be dressed up with some cute wedge sandals.",pos
"Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won's slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it doesn't matter that it's high waisted but i don't have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny.",pos
"I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.",pos
"Love, love, love this skirt. perfect for the holidays but it can also be dressed down. pair it with gold, burgundy, black or a more casual chambray jean shirt. a great price point and i was able to grab it when it was 20% off.",pos
"So i ordered this because i like amadi dreses in general, and was curious how hte long one would fit. i do love it, it is really comfortable. color is pretty neitral, material is thick enough for fall, california winters and cold spring days. can be dressed up a little with nice heeled booties. i am less than 5'2"" (115 lbs if curious# and this worked on me #petite, xs). i say go for it!",pos
"Purchased this for new years eve and an early january wedding. can't say enough good things about it! the lace fabric is soft with the perfect weight. the style is slimming and flattering. although i am short, i have a full bustline and ordered regular rather than petite and it fits perfectly. pants are very easy to hem if needed.
needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.4 seasons appropriate!",pos

"Good quality; casual feel good dress. it can be worn as dress, or as tunic over the pants.",pos
"Although this is not my husband''s favorite (he prefers things a little more tailored). i absolutely adore this! i got this in the ivory/cream color not realizing they had it in two more colors. i just ordered the blue. i loved the way the size small fit (not as wide), but the medium for my height (5'7"") fit better and was longer. if i want to wear it as a dress, i could. i highly recommend this!! well made and looks great!!!",pos
I bought these pants for my girlfriend for christmas. she really loved them! the material the pants are made of is very comfortable. the animals are super cute too.,pos

This shirt is way too flowy and the pink color is extremely washed out- will definitely be returning!,neg

"I wasn't expecting to like this tank as much as i do because of the other reviews...i thought i would send it back if i didn't like it, i appreciate the design, fabric, and construction! i plan on wearing it out to dinner with some friends coming in from out of town tomorrow night...can't wait!",pos

Really pretty top. very different colors and style = nothing like anything i have. delivered in timely manner. highly recommend.,pos
Bought as a gift. really soft and cozy. i am sure she will love it!,pos
I found the fit of this dress odd. i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses. the 6 fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge. i am a 34c so i need some type of support. i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price. i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store.,neg
"This is an amazing dress. beautiful fabric and color. comfortable too. it's like wearing air. sorta chameleon like because this print  literally goes with anything and looks unforgettable on. it's slimming too. i got the large and it flows so nicely over my body. the back is completely open. it closes with a tie at the neck and the waist that drapes beautifully and looks great from the side view. the fabric is a bit sheer so i ordered the white cotton slip by this designer, which is slightly snu",pos

I ordered this dress in oatmeal the minute i saw it online. i'm 5'5 and 115 lbs. and my usual xs fits perfectly. i would say this dress will be the most flattering on a long lean body type.

"This sweater is just as pictured. the fit is true to size, though it is a looser style rather than fitted sweater. it is short, though not cropped, and the sleeves are 1-2"" too long, but it is still flattering. it hits at the top of my hip and it looks great with high-waisted flares. the scallop detail is perfect, just enough interest, but not overbearing. the material is soft and heavier than expected. it is a good weight for fall. i wish it was made of natural fibers instead of synthetics, but",pos
Love this dress. i wore it with black boots and got so many compliments super comfortable.  i feel like this dress will never go out style.,pos
"In a sea of dresses, this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape, and ended up trying both the medium and the large, taking the medium home. it was super flattering on, and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.

here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving, i put it on, and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed.",neg
"I bought these pants in the wine color and i love them! i found them to be true to size. i always wear a 27 in pilcro and these were no exception. i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile. they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3"" but i think i prefer this. these pants can easily be dressed up or down - have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats. super cute!",pos
"These jeans are really soft, comfortable, and flattering, but only after you go a size down. all the other pilcro jeans i've bought have been a consistent 30, but when i got these they were baggy. i exchanged them for a 29, and they were just the ticket.",pos
I was waiting for this top to go on sale because its one of those tops that you can probably only find the right weather to wear it once a year. so i was so happy i could order this ahead of time and pick it up in the store the same day!,pos
"This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however, at about the mid-belly range, the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price, i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.",neg
"This is a beautiful color top! it can be dressy or casual but the design is spectacular!
i paired it with one of the new retailer pencil skirts and everyone in the store looked it!
i wish they had other colors!!!!!!",pos
"As of late, it's been difficult for me to find clothing at retailer that fit's true-to-size. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs. and i've had to return several pieces because they were too big on me. this versatile piece fits true-to-size. i purchased an xsp. like the previous reviewer, i've tried this with a couple of different long-sleeve shirt and tights combinations. i think this will work in the spring and fall, too as the material is in between heavy and light/airy. great for work.",pos
"First off, these are great because they are not so tight like all other work out crops that my anatomy is not a mystery to people around me. i have an athletic build and these pants are awesome in that they hug the body lightly. they are so soft and comfy also. perfect for running and the gym and apres whatever. i bought a back up pair.",pos
"Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise, so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either, it looks like a cheap levi's color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise, you might like them. i can't comment on fit..",neg
Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!,pos
"Completely oversized top, size medium was swimming on me.....boxy, baggy, shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo, returned.",neg
"I've never spent this much on a pair of jeans, but per another customer review that they were ""worth every penny"" i took the plunge. so glad i did. and also glad i sized down one size. be careful when you put them on - i keep putting my toe through the hole at the knee!",pos
"Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white, flowing and delicate it is not see-through so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun. lovely top!",pos
"I wear this top all the time! perfect with jeans and can't wait to wear with a skirt in the summer.
i am 5'2 and have the xs which hits in a great length, just as pictured. i bought at full price, so for the sale price you are getting a great deal!",pos
"Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect, shouldn't fit tight, should flow, has lots of room, it is linen, adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.",pos
Beautiful blend of colors and the texture of the shirt is so soft...perfect fall weather garment!,pos
"I didn't really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail. i love cloth & stone and this is just not up to their normal quality. i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse. it's very soft, but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadn't even tried them on yet. material is super soft, but thin. cut is weird under the arms and tight. sleeves are also tight! i am usually an xs or s in cloth & stone so i ordered smalls. i just fit the arms, but t",neg
This skirt is so soft and warm! looks gorgeous with middi boots or ankle boots. colors are beautiful and the length is perfect to take you into spring!,pos
Fits great! love soft material. love with skinny jeans brown boots,pos
"Works great on my 5'11"" frame.  is pretty and feminine.  great with skinny jeans and booties!",pos
Love this dress! it can be worn in cold or warm weather with tights and boots or sandals and bare legs. the fit is roomy and a little longer in back. it washes nicely without losing length.,pos
"I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot, but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me, however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality, thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.",pos
"The fabric of the pants is a great thickness so the pants have a very nice look. the fabric is smooth, not jean material. for me this is nice because though they have weight to them, the pants are not hot and can be used to dress up or down, much more versatile than jeans. these pants are very fitted through the hips but then fall very nicely. i am not a big fan of capri length yet i really love these! i have already enjoyed wearing these out and they look fabulous with any type of wedge or heel",pos
Love classical look and this dress may look great on not so much curvy shape. price is great with extra 40% off so considering to get dark red one as well now!,pos
"I just love this dress! the color, the quality, the design - all great! sizing can be tricky however. i sized down due to reading the other reviews, and i'm glad i did - it fits perfectly! this dress does not have a zipper on top, so if you have broad shoulders it might be a little harder to squeeze into.",pos
"I really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress in-store. and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online, the label says machine wash. (it also says lay flat to dry.) so i was happy about that. i tried this in xs regular (first photo with camisole) which was too low-cut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo (i'm a 34aa, ~105 lbs.) which was better; higher v-neck mainly and shorter length, although i could've gone with eit",pos
"I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings.",pos
"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the ""red"" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed",pos
"Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online. i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more ""normal"" cut. hip length and slimming, the fabric and collar are beautiful!",neg
This is a stylish blouse with classic features as well as quirky features such as pleats and gathers. very flattering fit!,pos
"I am curvy/petite. this fits great, is true to size, is super comfortable and lined with cotton. very pretty and well made.",pos
Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.,pos
Love love love this jumpsuit. i can't wait to wear it in the tx summer. it is super fun and elegant. you can dress it up or keep it casual. i am 5'9 155 and wear a 10. it laying quite nicely and doesn't require you to wear heels with it.,pos
"I so loved this dress online. not so much in person. first of all it didn't fit my build. i'm 5'4"" with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering. mainly i'm returning it because of the fabric. the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out. my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed. basically it's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat. if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful. why they made i",neg
"Saw this tunic on line and loved the color combo. tried it on at the store and found it to be true to size for me - i'm a 34 dd, 5 ft 4 and the regular size 10 fit fine. i was curious to see if the petite size would fit best with the loops for the tie belt being a little higher, but none were available. still the regular 10 works well. excited to wear when the weather gets warmer like the model with white skinny or cropped jeans, and wearing it open as a duster with a tank or cami. seems very ve",pos
"I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale, i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt.",pos
"This is a great every day dress. the buttons in the back make it very figure flattering, and i love the long sleeves. the fabric is light, so i'll definitely be wearing with leggings.

it's a little tight in the shoulders, which is pretty standard for this brand for me.",pos
"Unfortunately, i will need to exchange for a bigger size. i am 5""3"", 115 pounds. i normally wear a 2 or a 4. i ordered a 4 and they are a bit too tight. i am worried the 6 will be to big but love the pants enough to give that a try. excellent quality.",pos
Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.,neg
"Saw this in the store in pink....very cool dress but i want black so i'm ordering it. the fabric was almost lace-like & it comes w a slip. it was sort of swingy, and designed to be a-line. loved it. the bell sleeves totally make it.",pos
"Maybe i shouldn't have sized up to an xl but i'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit. the vee is quite low and i'm busty. it'll be really low if you're smaller on top. the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me. not tight at all. it's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view, i looked like a really wide green apple. i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldn't recommend it.",neg
"I love this dress. it is the kind of dress that i dream about. the feel is young and carefree. typically i love swing dresses on the tall thin models pictured but when i try them on i simply look frumpy. this dress is an exception. i have the lilac version and the fabric color and pattern enhance the boho pixie fairy aesthetic. for reference i am 5'4"" 122 lbs...average build a little busty 34dd. only the 6 was in stock so that is the size i ordered even though i wanted to try the 4. the 6 has en",pos
"I bought these cords in navy. the color is beautiful and the fit is great. it is a very slimming fit. i am usually between a 27 and 28, i ordered the 28 and they fit perfectly!",pos
"I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.",pos
This product is perfect for early fall wear. when the weather is a little cooler a shell worn under it will be fabulous,pos
"I'm in love, i'm in love.

this dress was gifted to me, because i was gawking at it so often. i love it!!! i am petite, 5'3"" 118 pounds and i could do either the small or extra small. the small was a little more comfortable, because the extra small was a bit tight in the arms-but i went with the extra small anyway. in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it. many people even took the extra step in compl",pos
"Great layering top. so comfy, feels soft as my pjs. bought it in 3 colors.",pos
"Love the gorgeous mustard/goldenrod shade but it's unflattering to my skintone (makes my olive-tan look more sallow). all the versions of the tied dresses that holding horses has come out with are fantastic in fit and flattering to the tummy. if you are busty/broad back/wide rib cage--size up. if you have generous hip/bum curves, give both your regular",pos
This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.,pos
Adorable soft top for the fall! i wanted to love it because of the colors and the fact that it is so retro! it was just way too big for me. i'm always a medium but in this i probably should have sized down. i still gave it 5 stars because it is so cute--just didn't fit me! sadly i will be returning this!,pos
"Love the color of this shirt! i wear it under a brown leather jacket i purchased, in store!",pos
"These jeans look amazing on! hug every curve in just the right way....the long length with flare...add a platform heel and i look like i have legs for days!! and my booty will definitely turn some heads! total splurge but for a great pair of jeans, totally worth it. ordered my usual size 27 and they fit like a dream. hope they don't stretch out after wearing a few hours. the amount of stretch feels nice, so i think they'll continue to hug your body. if you want 1 pair of flares in your wardrobe.",pos
"This looked like a simple, chic blouse, but the fabric felt cheap to me, like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.",neg
I love this blouse! the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile! i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time. one of my favorite retailer purchases ever!,pos
"Really fun comfortable pants. i haven't worn them yet as its hot here but i can't wait. i tried them on with wedge sandals & a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome. i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says ""italians do it better"" and a jean jacket...i'm loving the look & feel of them, bring on the cool autumn days.",pos
Matronly and unflattering. i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type.,neg
"This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i'm 5'1"" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!",pos
"I love this top - it is the cutest top i've purchased in a while. the colors are so fun and the cut is flattering. it will go with plenty and will work for day and night, for work and on weekends. you need to get this top before it sells out. retailer please get this top in more patterns!!",pos
"I could live in these jeans, they are so comfortable. they are have the perfect amount of stretch and the fabric is so soft. i was skeptical because that usually means they lose their shape and i'm yanking on them all day, however, i have worn them 3 days now and on the third day they may have stretched a little in the waist. i am normally a 28, but can get away with 27 sometimes; i chose the 28 and felt the fit was perfect. by the way, i'm wearing the jeans with the cubanas ciara glitter boots,",pos
"I love this dress and received many compliments when i wore it. the pink is beautiful. however, it does run large so i will need to exchange it. the little square at the base of the neckline was crooked on the one i received. might not bug anyone else, but it bothered me.",pos
"This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more. 

buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.",neg
"I sized down from a 27 p to a 26 p because i like a less loose fit. if you want a slight baggy look then go with your usual size. i love the style, contrasting hem color and slight distressing look. great for end of summer into fall!",pos
"I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.",neg
"I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet, the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit, feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive, sturdy and very comfortable to wear, even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings, parties, etc.)",pos
"Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric. for the first few wearings, i was in love. then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend. my mother said, ""that's going to pill up."" and i ignored her. and she was right.",neg
"This sweater/jacket looks just like the photo in real life, but the inside is so scratchy. i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper. unlined and uncomfortable. no thank you!

should you choose to proceed, i found the fit tts. i'm 5'8, wear an 8/10 and the medium worked for me.",neg
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately. finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard (small chest, rounder in the middle and hips like whoa) but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering. love the quality and feel of the fabric. i've worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath, but then again it isn't a piece i plan to wear to work. i'm usually a sz 8/10 and got the medium regular which is perfect. i'm 5'5 and the bottom hit",pos
"Soft, comfy, great fit. this is the perfect cozy item for fall and winter. looks really cute with the sleeves rolled or cuffed slightly. the fabric is patchworked with linen and a terry/jersey material. i'm usually a medium and the medium fit great. slimming lines and does a great job of being swingy/flared, without that tent look.",pos

i got the black but want to order it in other colors as well. can be dressed up or down.",pos
"I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large, as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also, the layering looks nothing like it does on the model, it looks sloppy, unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist, otherwise it just doesn't wor",neg
"I haven't worn these yet but i wouldn't wear them just to ""lounge"" in. i wear an xs & they fit good & tts. they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice & doesn't bunch like some do. the material is soft & hangs nice. & doesn't seems like it will wrinkle. love the pattern of the black print ones. it's black, tan & white & kind of a paisley print. i think it looks better on than in the picture.",pos

C'mon. the accent is wrong! a simple google search would prevent this.,neg

Cup size is really small for a medium. no way to adjust the back strap. ended up giving it to my daughter. cute but so poorly executed.,neg
I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.,pos
"Gorgeous color, flowy fabric, unique design - this top is a winner. i don't even mind that i'll have to wear a strapless bra with it! a little bit on the larger size, but not too big in my opinion.",pos
"I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed. loved the skirt part of it. but the top, which i guess i didn't see in photo was pleated as well, made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides. would have been a wonderful summer dress, flowing and cool.",neg
"I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail. the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck. that being said, i was so disappointed in the fit. i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped. cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides. made no sense! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit. order up for length, down for arm length ...",neg

Cute kitty sweater! i'm 5 feet 105 # and went with a regular size xs instead of petite and it hits perfectly!  yes it's itchy it wool! but i plan on wearing mine with a high/low tee under it. so cute!,pos

"Lovely blouse-- very well made. i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing-- right now somewhere between a 36d and c. the medium was a little roomy for, i could've easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size. quality fabric, very comfortable yet dressy. i'd definitely recommend this blouse.",pos
This dress fits and hangs so nicely. it is so versatile as well. dress it up or down!,pos

"This dress didn't do much for me on the hanger but it was on sale and thought i would try it on in the store. so glad i did, definitely cuter on than just hanging there. the back has a belt feature that adds a little structure. the colors are nice and bright. will be good for our hot austin summers.",pos

"I bought this top on a whim - it's not 100% my style, but wanted to try something different. the fabric and print are amazing! so unique, soft, subtle, and delicate. great fit as well. my only complaint is not the fault of the top, but if you have a bit of tummy, the fold at the peplum really brings it out so you'd have to wear high-waisted bottoms or suck it in. the hem is also really flowy, more so than shown in the pictures. theres a lot of fabric so it kind of ruffles more at the bottom rath",pos
"This actually might be my favorite thing that i have ever owned.  the jacket is so beautiful and so cozy jacket. i agree that the pics do not do this amazing piece justice.  for reference, i am 5'7 140 lbs and bought the large to allow a bit of room for layering.",pos

Love everything about this top.  the ruffles give the top a great edgy style.  will look great with some skinny jeans and boots.,pos

"This swimsuit is super cute and retro. the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass 1950s-inspired look. great for us ladies without a lot up top. i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit! i love the back coverage, too -- your butt doesn't hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdy.

"This is my new favorite white top in my closet - the loose fit, flowy quality fabric, and effortless versatility are spot on for anyone's wardrobe. i took my usual size s - i wouldn't size down in this because although it's roomy in the torso, the sleeves and shoulders fit perfectly on my thin arms. everyone should have this beauty!",pos
"I am 5'8"", about 140, athletic build. i purchased this dress for business meetings and such. i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i  am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it. luckily this is the case here too! the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love. nice fabric, good quality. happy i bought it!",pos
"This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness, i had to say no. i will watch for sale.",pos
"I ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online -- i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy. the navy blue underlayer is so flattering, and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely. the shape and pattern are forgiving. this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days. this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue. if you're between sizes (especially arm-wise), i'd order up. otherwise just get your regular size. the body is flo",pos
"I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed. i'm a 36d, and the l was so tight i couldn't get it over my chest. also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped.  and the fabric is shiny, the picture makes it look like it's matte. if it did fit like the model i would've loved it. the print is beautiful though. bummer",neg
"This top is absolutely adorable, i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring, this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this, get it! you won't regret it.",pos
"I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.",neg
"I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail. the floral design is nice, but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt (especially considering the price). most disappointingly, the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes. with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and, thus, could not even put the shirt on. needless to say, i will be returning it. i ordered the xs, so it is possible that larger sizes do n",neg
Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.,pos
The jeans are even better in person. great fit and the color is nice. my new fave!,pos
"Yes, $48 may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt, but this is one is worth it -- i can wear this with *everything*! i bought this in grey, and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night, or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day. one of the best retailer purchases i've made in a while!",pos
I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent,pos
Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!,pos
I bought this top in taupe and love the style. it's not too boxy or long. cotton is always a plus and i just wish there were more colors.,pos
Love this dress. perfect for spring and fall. great material and well made. lovey design. the dress has a built in slip.,pos
"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend.
i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention).",pos
I've been looking for a cozy sweater dress for a while because everything always seems to be so form fitting. i'm between an xs and a small and i got the small for this and it's just a little roomy so it's perfect. fabric is pretty thin so it drapes well and it won't be too warm.,pos
Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me. the colors weren't as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge. not flattering and it went back. i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved. not hard to do at all,neg

i am exchanging for one size smaller.
it is worth the effort of exchanging!

"Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts, or the cut of this was not right for me, but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didn't lay right on me. sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small.",neg
"The quality of the garment is high--a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern, but the cut was totally off for me. i'm usually an xs/s, and was swimming in the xs. the arms in particular were huge and drapey, and the whole thing just hung on me (for reference, i'm 5'4"", 120 lbs).",neg

This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.,pos
"I think this blouse looks better in real life than it does on line and i'm glad i decided to try it on. i bought an extra small in the red which i think is the best color. the white looks like a nightgown. too bad there were not more darker fall prints because i would have bought more than one. i think this style would look best on someone that is tall and thin. a petite person might get away with turning it into a dress. i would buy a longer version of this . as it is it is a fun, feminine casu",pos
"I first saw this vest displayed in the window and admired the colors and weave. i couldn't get it out of my mind, so i had to make a special trip back to retailer to buy it. it is soft and drapes well. looks amazing with denim and boots. i think it will be my favorite fall purchase.",pos

beautiful and vibrant colors, very well made- just wish some of the retailer sizes wouldn't run on the smaller side!!!",pos
"This sweater is adorable. i got it in the grey pattern. it's got a great, forgiving fit, lots of stretch, with a hi-low waist, in a thick, soft knit and 3-quarter sleeves. the contrasting collar and cuffs add interest. it's great with jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. i can't wait for the weather to cool down so i can wear it. i might get it in more colors, too. it's a great basic.",pos
"This is such a great piece. throw this top on with a pair of skinnies and some booties and you're dressed. it walks the line between too tight and too loose beautifully for my figure. love the contrast lining. it washes beautifully (i hang to dry). i wore it twice the first week i owned it. size s was best for me. i'm 5'4, 140lb, 34b, and generally a size 6.",pos

I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer. this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms. it's clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me. i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it. it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure (5'8 and athletic). i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu,neg

"I wanted to love this top, but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much, much lighter grey. in addition, this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed.",neg
Love this hoodie. so soft and goes with everything. highly recommend for comfort and style. great company.,pos

Beautiful emerald green color in a lovely silk. i suggest one size down if you're small chested as the arm holes will fit more snugly.,pos
I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.,pos

I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit,pos
This shirt is really lovely. the fabric is soft and comfortable and the embroidery is very well done. it looks great with jeans and adds a little feminine touch to the look.,pos

i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model, but for me it hits at a nice length; i have a short waist and am busty. the lace doesn't hit my neck",pos
"This top is lovely. it's got a decent length to it, so it can be tucked into nice pants or a skirt. the gold beading design on the shoulders is a little heavy, which can sometimes cause it to slip/sag off the shoulder -- not entirely off, but enough to reveal a bra strap for a kind of off-shoulder look! it's very flattering if you tuck it in, or even if you don't. i got this top in red, and it's lovely --a little more towards than coral side than crimson.",pos
Super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky.,neg

I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.,pos
"This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it's a perfect fit.",pos
This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.,pos

"I felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes. i am long, lean, and broad shouldered. i normally wear a m, but ordered a l. it still fits snug, so i've exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape, as pictured on the model. material and color of the red motif is darling; light as a feather & will take me spring through summer.",pos
"I saw this dress several times and never try it. then i finally put it on. omg, i love it! it does run large. i am usually medium. but the small size is perfect on me i visually like the blue color. but the orange one is cuter on me. the length is great. i am 5'4''. it's right to my lower ankle. so i don't need to wear heel. the quality is very good. it's a great weekend dress.",pos
"Is not a place i want to be, even if the style of a sweater is great.  yes, this sweater is very cropped, but i think it&amp;#39;s definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit.  it&amp;#39;s the itchiness that makes it an immediate &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;, and that&amp;#39;s coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance.",neg
"I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me. if you don't mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially, then it might be for you. i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute, but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up.",neg
Just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much. i've had the black and white for about 2 years now and they are still intact! only the buttons fall off once in a while but that's when i'm being aggressive and on the go buttoning. the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection!,pos
"This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.",neg
"The colors are vibrant and the beading is beautifully simple and nicely done. i waited quite a few months for this dress but it was worth the wait! it's loose fitting, but still gives you some shape without looking like you are wearing a potato sack!",pos
"This top looked so cute on! i loved the color and the way it looked on my body. as cute as this looked tied, it could also be worn open as well with a tank top. loved it!",pos
"The shirt is cute, but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correct--it's a crop top. this was returned.",neg
"Flattering fit and neckline. too thin to wear without a cami or tank underneath (for me), but i was expecting that. great go-to tee.",pos
Comfortable & the color was great. just as it looks in the picture. nice design,pos
The floral print and colors are so pretty for summer that it's tempting to layer this over a seamless tank and wear it out!,pos
"Absolute best pair of yoga pants. they are the softest material- so comfy! i'm 5'3, 125lbs with a curvy figure and the m fit perfectly :)",pos
"I disagree with the other reviews...the colors on this dress are great. bright against the black and the studs are super cute. and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch. fun dress. i think it's as fitted or not as you want. drives me crazy when people get hung up on their ""size"" to judge clothes. go up or down if it doesn't fit the way you want. i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly.",pos
Adorable denim dress! fabric is lighter than i imagined but is very flattering. perfect length. this is not a form fitting dress at all so if you're going for that pass on the dress or possibly order a size down.,pos
"Love this tee, purchased the blue and white, i usually wear xs in many retailer items but opted for a medium in this tee so it would fit loose. works good not fitting too tight. i like it because it's a tee shirt but it's a little dressy, great for going out to dinner, etc...",pos
"This is one of my favorite sweaters of the season. it is warm and cozy and looks so cute with jeans. it's definitely a little shorter on me than it looks on the model, even though i'm only 5'4.",pos
"I bought this in the dark gray and it's got a lot of blue undertones to it. it's beautiful and flattering in my regular size, not too fitted -- not as loose as on the model but still roomy enough. i'll take the advice of a previous reviewer and wash only the armpits when needed. this fabric is so delicate i'm afraid it will shrink if i ever submerge the whole thing in water. it's a gorgeous piece and i'm happy to have it for the remaining cool days of the season.",pos
"I bought this online days before my trip to seattle. i read the reviews so was aware it runs large...and it does. i practically lived in it the whole time i was there. it's very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal i'll be back in it. some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but didn't like the ties hanging loose. i just looped each one and it works great. 
it really runs large. i bought their smallest size and had ample room.",pos
I love these pants and wear them all the time. i wish they hadn't been discontinued,pos
"I love, love, love this skirt. very flattering. i am 5'7"",125# with a 27"" waist, and ordered a size 4 based on previous reviews. yes, it is snug through the hips. i think it will stretch a bit with wear; however, i imagine curvy ladies may want to size up (sadly, i was not blessed with much in the way of curves). the material is thick. the skirt is lined. the print is beautiful. this is one skirt i was happy to pay full price for rather than risk missing it.",pos
"Runs a little big, but cute and comfortable. also shows bra straps a bit on each side, even when i ordered a size smaller. overall, very happy with it.",pos
This cover-up is perfect for the beach or the pool. it is see through.,pos
"Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately, the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well, but was poorly made. based off other reviews, this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.",neg
"Not your classic sweatshirt. can be worn with black, grey, mauve",pos
"This is an amazing sweater. thick but not overly thick, the material is beautiful and the colors rich, i love the collar and the way it closes as well as the pockets and the back being different from the front. i hope it washes well. i bought the moss. it fits nicely and is very slimming. i highly recommend.",pos
"Lovely holiday blouse, flows at the bottom but doesn't bell out like some tunic blouses. the arms aren't cut in to much and i found that flattering to my shoulders the velvet and trim is strong and solid while the bottom half has a sweet little polka dot finish. charming and romantic.",pos
"I didn't pay much attn to this online. i'm not much on front hook & tie closures. well, saw today at the local store & decided to try on both the s & m. i am usually a s in tops, but the m was only a bit more roomy & longer than the s, so i went with the size m. i thought the styling of it paired well w/ the pilcro cord skinnys i had on. looked much better than the pics online. i have other pilcro skinny cords & jeans in vs colors so i think this top will work out well for me. love the 3/4 sleev",pos
"Soooo disappointed in this dress. the colors are beautiful for fall. the fabric feels luxe. the slip fits perfectly. the dress however is a hot mess. it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress. huge everywhere. under the arms, and waist and hips. it's just an enormous tent. i am 5'8"", 128 lbs. i ordered my usual size small. i looked shapeless in this. i can't think of any body type it would flatter. potentially, women quite far along in their pregnancy.",neg
"My new favorite sweater for layering!! perfect color, length and fit. i am 5""4, 125 and purchased my usual small. if you're on the fence about this one i say try it on it's totally worth it!",pos
"I want to address that with lightweight but not too skimpy for the summertime, and the stress works perfectly. i got the red in a small, and although one reviewer said that she did not like that the top and bottom are two different materials i actually think it's super cute. not sure if i would pay the full price, but the 20% off sale made it worth it.",pos
Im normally an xs and i bought size 2 and it fit great. very slimming and looks great with white capris.,pos
"I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie, but the quality, fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this, but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand, it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut, the fabric is clearly lace, but beautifully done. and the feel is lov",pos
Too big and it's not secure enough to wear for swimming.,neg
"The pants are pretty and run true to size, but the fabric is bathing suit like, very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat. i wouldn't recommend for anything but waking.",neg
"This dress! the picture doesn't do the dress justice. its so beautiful, well made, and unique. lots of beading and detailing for the price. i'm super happy with my purchase !",pos
I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.,neg
My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!,neg
"I picked this maxi up in navy to go with my summertime capsule wardrobe that i will be doing extensive travel with this summer. this dress is well made and fits my frame in a size m perfectly (5'4, 125lbs, 34c). it is substantial enough to disguise any backside indiscretions and the halter style front does not expose the girls. i do wear petals with this dress to ensure that i don't put on a show especially in air conditioned rooms. this launders easily and doesn't look rumpled and wilted after",pos
"This is such an amazing take on a white blouse. it's fun and still polished! the fabric is so soft and so easy to dress up or down!

the arm holes run a little small but the cut of everything else is amazing.",pos
"Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them, but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!",pos
"I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight, but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently, nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric, i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded, and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4"", weigh 134 lbs, and do typically wear size medium.",pos
"I love the design of this top - short and swingy, with a cute mock turtleneck and interesting textured pattern. definitely runs large - if you're between sizes, definitely go for the smaller one. it also has pretty large armholes, so you can kind of see your bra from the side.",pos
"This arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online!! i'm a curvy gal so i honestly wasn't feeling like this would look good on me. but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model! the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to it...like it would be rainproof! the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion, even cuter than the blue side! the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj",pos
"I own a couple of bailey 44 dresses and am a huge fan of their comfort and ability to flatter my figure. when i saw this one on a special promo, i knew i had to try it on. once i did, i knew it had to come home with me. i wore it to a work event last night and look forward to wearing it on a date night soon. i am a s or m and took a s in this dress. i went with cobalt and paired it with gold jewelry as in the photo.",pos
Love this! fits great. warm and soft. would recommend,pos
"I purchased this dress for a summer celebration. i am petite, but ordered the dress in a misses size (one size smaller) because i wanted it to hit right at the knee, rather than the shorter above-the-knee length pictured. i loved all about the dress - the fact that the colors are more vibrant than in the picture and that is has a beige slip.. i dressed it up with gold chandelier earrings and nude sandals and got compliments form almost everyone. i am planning to dress it down with espadrilles.",pos
"I bought this outfit online on sale - so i only paid $70, but i think if i saw it in person first, i probably wouldn't have purchased it. while the design is cute, the fabric is beyond cheap. it's not just polyester - it's like a plastic polyester. i think if you dress it up with high heels, necklace, armful of bangles, you can probably distract from the fabric. 

5'5"", 120lb, purchased xs and it's a little big still.",neg
"On a positive note the dress was very well made, great quality as usual from retailer. however. this dress looked like a sack, i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape. very plain and unflattering. for reference i am 5 5 140lbs 34c ...so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me. it had to go back.",neg
Love these lightweight pants... they're beyond comfortable and the print is darling! hope this designer has additional pieces next season!,pos
I haven't worn it yet. i tried it on when i got it and like it alot,pos
"I bought this top for work and going out.  it is a beautiful top that goes with many items in my closet like my red blazer, grey blazer, red cardigan etc.  it is very flattering.  the arm holes weren't too big.  fit tts.",pos
"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  
i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.
for reference, i'm 5'10"", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,",neg
Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.,pos
"This is one of my favorite pieces. simple, classy, and cozy!",pos
"Went to the chicago michigan ave location and found this gem in the ""take a peek"" section... i think that's what it's called.  anyway... been looking for a plane white top to wear with a red lace pencil skirt and this fit the bill! wore it today with a grey midi skirt and sneakers and looks adorable!  it does flare a little and makes me feel like i'm wearing a maternity top but i don't care i love it!  went back to another retailer location and purchased the lilac one! can't wait to wear that one",pos
"This is truly the best black dress...you can wear to sooo many things. a long time keeper for the closet. i felt it ran a little bit big...i am normally an 8-10...i bought both sizes (8 and 10)...kept the 8...but felt i could even get away with a 6...but didn't want to pay shipping again for another size. i am 5'7"" and 155lbs. it is truly a flattering dress for any figure.",pos
"I wore this dress to nyc on a date. it was perfect...light, flowy, and lovely. the peach and green combination is really pretty, and i love the hemline, which is longer in the back than in the front. i can only say one thing: as i was walking down the street with my boyfriend, a total stranger (and not a crazy person) came up to us and told us we looked beautiful. enough said.",pos
"I really wanted to love this shirt. the fit was great, and the fabric just felt beautiful. luxurious, soft and flowing. but the collar was frayed... in addition, the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship. i put it aside to return it, then this morning went to have another look at it, wanting to talk myself back into it. but i can't overlook the fact i'd be ordering a new shirt that would look time-worn. it may be only this",neg
"These jeans are my new favorites! very flattering cut and color, and very high quality. i've worn them a ton since i got them, and they haven't stretched out or lost their shape at all. only thing i would caution is that they run small... for reference, i wear a 26 in paige denim, a 27 in citizens, and 28 was perfect in these.",pos
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i love the colors and pattern. i've just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame. i'm a size 8/10 right now. i do like it with or without the tie for different effects. one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only. i usually don't buy dry clean clothes, but might make an exception for this one.",pos
"I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top, but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.",neg
"My new favorite! i wouldn't have thought twice about this dress handling on a rack in store, but after seeing so many cute pics of ladies in this dress, i caved. i needed a petite, so ordered a sp and xsp. the length on both is perfect. i'm 5'0"" and both hit above my knee in front and hit at in back and on sides. i didn't try on a regular in store, but based on the sp/xsp, i'm pretty sure there'd be too much material for a petite frame. the xsp is cut slimmer and if i had a tiny waist, i'd proba",pos
"Great jacket! warm as a coat yet thin enough to wear indoors. i dress up with a fitted dress, or dress down with jeans. very versatile and comfortable. i always get compliments on it.",pos
"I am a sucker for a peasant dress. i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door, but this dress is ridiculous. i look like a schoolmarm. the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory. i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly, so i'm bummed that this wasn't what i expected. i knew it would have flow, but it's more billowy than i wanted. stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school.",neg
"This is probably my new favorite bathing suit. the colors are a tad different than in the picture, but still really pretty",pos
Fits perfect!! tank top or bath top. swings nicely and not too tight on top. i ordered large and am a 38 d. sits perfect not long not short!,pos
"I purchased this top in the black color and absolutely love it! it is very fun and can be either dressed up or down. i would wear this to work as well as out and about around town. it is worn loose, so i ordered a size down. i cannot wait to wear it through spring and summer!",pos
"This sweater is the kind of find i hope for when i browse the retailer website or walk into the store. i tried two sizes -- i sometimes wear an s and sometimes an xs these days -- and after trying them both i felt that with this sweater it was better to err on the side of snugness. the hooks and eyes pull a bit, but i won't be fastening this all the way to the top. the smaller size works better to hug my waist before the peplum flares out. the color is a dreamy pinky nude (more pink than nude), an",pos
Looks so fun and whimsical on. love love love this for photos especially,pos
"I noticed the reddish one (actually, barney-purple) in my local store and had to try it one, since i like this cut of dresses from my teenage years. the color was my main concern, but this proved perfect overall. it is low cut in the bust, but a scarf can fix it for us modest girls. there were quite a few loose threads on the lace and stiching that i had to trim off. for the reference, i am 5'4"", 120 lbs, and an xs was perfect.",pos
Loved it! i am curvy and it is very hard to find a dress that looks easy and at the same time shapes you. the various cuts of the different prints are placed in the right place in the body . easy dress and beautiful. there should be more dresses in this style in different color combos.,pos
"This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami, skinny jeans and boots. i'm wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed. i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline. my only slightly negative comment is about the quality. the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut. still keeping it though!",pos
This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.,pos
"This top fits exactly like the last photo, which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size, and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick, so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.",pos
"Love this tank. it's nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms. it's very forgiving if you have a midsection. it's soft, and great colors. really nice for spring casual looks.",pos
This dress is so beautiful & fits my hourglass figure perfectly. it's fully lined & the print is nicer in person. very easy dress to wear to many summer occasions! i'm an 8-10 on top & 10-12 on the bottom. size 10 dress fit perfectly!,pos
"Dress fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. great for day or evening. love it!,",pos
This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.,pos
"I am in lust with this fabulous dress. it's a feast for the eyes. it's so busy and detailed, yet it all works. fit on me is perfect. i did not have to size down or up. my upper torso is larger (m/l) than my bottom half (m/s). i also have a square waist. this dress makes me look like i have an hourglass figure. i love it as much as the mona dress. another point goes to ease of putting it on. i own six byron lars dresses and this is the *easiest* one to put on! just zip up and go.",pos
"The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering.",pos
Saw this in the store and just had to have it. beautiful design. fits perfectly. looks nice with a belt as well.,pos
"I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!",pos
"I own another dolan dress which is virtually the same as this but has long sleeves. i wear the long-sleeved one whenever i give presentations or readings. the material is absolutely genius for travel. just unpack, shake it out and you're good to go.
i love the sleeves on this short-sleeved version. i'm fairly fit but at my age i'm not excited about showing off my arms! the drape is beautiful and i can wear high heels, bootees or flats with it. i bought the red. sometimes you can't tell if the c",pos
"This was so unflattering. the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs. the green was a beautiful, vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag.",neg
I own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite. the ombre design makes it stand out. the embroidery is beautiful. these are usually tops i throw on during my time off/weekends and i have received many compliments on this one. tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller.,pos
"I purchased the mauve dress from an retailer store last weekend during their 20% off sale. i absolutely can not say enough great things about this dress. it fits beautifully... the pattern on the material is so pretty and feminine. once i got home from the store and tried the dress on again, i immediately purchased the black one also. i had to have it in black too! such a great dress to wear to parties, date night, friends outings.. we are going to california in september and will be wearing these",pos
I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas,pos
"I&#39;ve been eyeing this dress for weeks. finally i took the plunge and bought it! the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful. i know many of the reviewers said it was running large, but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l (no stretch). im normally a size 16 and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips. definitely more of a shift than a swing. however its still just lovely. looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow!",pos
"This shirt is a 10! i've been looking for an off the shoulder top that i can wear a bra with. i almost never spend full price on retailer items but this one is worth every penny. don't hesitate, just buy it!",pos
"The sides scooped up a bit too much on me. i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work, but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff. back it goes. :(",neg
The most amazingly versatile cardi you'll ever own! it goes with everything from boyfriend jeans and booties to black chiffon pleated skirt. it's soft and feminine and makes you feel like you look like a million dollars! definitely worth the price.,pos
Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.,pos

"Great hopes but a sorry disappointment. at this price, one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model. the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket. i am 5'6"" and ordered xxs. garment was significantly over-sized. i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit. because of the oversizing, the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo. sadly, this buttondown has to be retur",neg

I love this sweater!!! it's so fun and quirky and shakes up a regular sweater. a little large but it fits the style.,pos
"First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich, deep, gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.",pos

"I adore these little joggers. i was immediately drawn to the color (army green) and the little details. i carry all my weight on bottom, so i don't often wear many retailer bottoms (i'm usually a 16). i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised! they are absolutely perfect. they fit a little baggy, as joggers do, and go with just about everything! mine did loosen a tad, but not like the previous reviewer. i highly recommend these! can't wait to wear these throu",pos

A great little dress that can be dressed up or down.,pos
"I am 5'2"", 120lbs. and bought the 4 petite, which is what i normally wear, and it fits perfectly. the quality of the fabric and stitching is good, not great, and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment, but for me, the style, the fit and the fact that it doesn't seem to show wrinkles, at least not before washing, turned it in to a keeper for me. the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it. i tried the ada belt with it, but found i",pos

"This beautiful, soft, swingy, dress is oversized on me.  usually when someone reviews that a dress runs large but their body type is opposite mine, i pick tts and 90% of the time i'm right.  not so in this case. the outer dress is very wide and the amazing super stretchy under slip is too large also.  debating on sizing down because of potential shrinkage after laundering.  i bought m and my stats are 5'3"" 140# 39/28/35.  dress ends just above my knees.

"This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders",neg
"Super soft, light fabric. this dress is perfect for work or the weekends. this brand is new to me but i'll definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future.",pos
"My sales assistant/style consultant watched the dresses i had collected to try on, and how they fit, and she brought this dress in, with a silk cocoon wrap for me to try on. i took one look on the hanger and made an assumption it would be too snug, highlight every bump, and i could not have been more wrong! this dress is wonderful on! it is the most flattering thing i have now in my closet. you must try this on to see how flattering it is. i am still stunned with how it looked and made me feel.",pos
"Love this jacket. it's soft and a beautiful shade of ivory. perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans, while still maintaining an elegant look.",pos
"Yes, it runs a little large - i usually get a s or m in tops, but for this i bought a s. i am 5'2"", 130 lbs, and i did not get the petite- i feel like the regular hits me at the same area as the model in picture. i went into retailer looking for a dress, and walked out with this vest too - had to have. versatile, stylish, pockets, good quality!",pos
"These pants are the perfect color, and i love the detail of the zippered pockets... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well. they were slightly loose, but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small. after an hour of wear, i was swimming in these! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly, um, saggy. i am in-between a 4 and 6, and since the pants are detailed as slim fit, i thought it",neg
Beautiful in every way. you can never go wrong with black and white. very lightweight since it's not a lined dress so it's perfect for our florida heat.,pos
I completely agree with the other reviewers this top is easy to throw on with jeans or trousers and so comfy! i'm 5'3 with a 34ddd chest and i ordered in my normal medium which looks fantastic. and if i wanted to i think i could have sized down for a more form flattering look but i love the ease of this top.,pos
This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.,neg
"I've already worn this dress 4 times and i bought 3 weeks ago. easy to wear, comfortable and flattering. i love and wish it was available it more patterns.",pos
"I saw the colorblock horizon dress in my local store (which sadly no longer carries petites) in the red/black color combination and loved it - the colorsblocking, the fabric, the length. after ordering a few petite sizes online the only xsp was the green/black. although not what i would normally where colorwise, i love this dress and the xsp is the only one that fits. this dress runs large and on a smaller frame, the sp looked shapeless and unattractive. perfect length and attractive v-neck that",pos
"I paired this gorgeous top with a black v-neck cardigan, mother lookers and black booties and felt and looked so totally feminine and amazing...i honestly lost count of the compliments that i received!!  beading is sewn on tightly, and the stitching on the embroidery has no loose ends.  i am 5'3""/108 and took the regular size small.  highly recommend!!",pos
"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked",pos
"I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling. unfortunately, it just didn't work out. i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front. the top was also boxy and didn't sit right. it just wasn't flattering. cute top on the hanger, but just not on me.",neg
"The photos online make it look like a comfortable, relaxed, lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out, but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.",neg
"Wanted this dress several months ago, but it was out of stock. finally was able to order and very glad i did, it is perfect! it fits exactly as i had hoped, the length is great, right above my knee and it hangs beautifully. looks great with my caramel colored boots and i received many compliments. just hoping they do some more drop waist dresses, especially for summer.",pos
"I searched far and wide for this dress. after ordering an 8, 10 and 12 from 3 different stores in two different cities, in a span of 2 months, i finally settled on the 10! i literally went searching for this while on vacation, too. i'm 5'5.5"", 160 lbs and 36c bust and the 10 fit perfectly. this dress is adorable and i've worn it to the office and on the weekends. this will definitely be in my biweekly rotation this summer. the quality is on point and it was definitely worth the price tag. i was",pos
"I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall",pos
"I bought this shirt in every color. i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is. it is very versatile. i wear it at networking semi formal events/ dinners/ going out with friends, and everywhere. i feel awesome with it.",pos
"I love this sweater! it is very lightweight- the knit is a wider weave, so if you are cold natured be sure to layer and bring a jacket. the fit is great, it is very flattering on. the back is lined and has the gray fabric that shows past the sweater hemline which adds to the uniqueness. this could be dressed up or down- i paired with a white tee and dark jeans and flats but will wear it next with nice pants and maybe a white collared blouse. very happy with my purchase!",pos
"I purchased this jacket in the beige color from the black friday sale and have already worn it several times. it is comfortable, warm. and stylish. i love it so much i got it as christmas gift for a good friend and my sister. as for sizing, i do find saturday/sunday brand runs a little big. i typically wear medium or size 8 in tops and bought the jacket in a size small.",pos
These shorts are really cute and are a flattering length. grey color has a silvery look to it. keepers.,pos
"I absolutely love this top, i purchase this brand frequently because the designs are simple, yet unique and cool. i'm 5'7"" 170 lb.s curvy/athletic and i got this in a medium, it fits perfectly and looks really great on! i love the asymmetric cut and raw hem... wish it came in more colors!",pos
This blouse fit better than i expected. looks great with jeans and is an easy go to top!,pos
"Nice fit, stretchy fabric, but they do not stretch out of shape or so much that they are too big after wearing for a few hours. very true to size and great length. i am going to buy another pair because i know once i wear these out i will want a back-up!",pos
"I'm extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings. the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive. the pattern ans styling are slimming. most importantly, they don't slide down during your workout! i'm 5'8'' and a size 12-14 and the large fit perfectly.",pos
"This shirt style is boxy, however, the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable. i love the look of the cuffs. this is a fun shirt to wear",pos
"The fabric, colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingy!
i am 5' 9"" and 135lbs. and even an x-small was too billowy to be cute. too bad- it's otherwise so great!",neg
"I purchased a medium. i am 5'6"" 140 lbs and it fit perfectly. the navy is pretty dark, almost black. the fabric is very soft. the cut is more form fitting in the top and then comes out to an a line. it is not as bulky as some swing dresses. in the photo it almost looks like a handkerchief hem, but in real life it is less pronounced. i have no negatives. i would consider getting a second pattern if it goes on sale.",pos
"This is a very cute fall dress that can be worn in a myriad of styles. from styling it with a pair of wedges and dark tights, to donning a bolo and ankle boots, heads will turn when you walk into the room.",pos
"I found this top to be quite flattering.........the slight give in the outer straps is necessary to allow for arm movement without issue.
i did not find it to diminish the aesthetic value.
i purchased it in white and loved it so much that i ordered the black also....not much of a pink person or i would have gotten that one too!
classic with a bit of a casual edge.
a must get!",pos
"I love this top and cannot wait to wear it. the material is a nice weight, the color is pretty, and the fit is very flattering and comfortable. be aware that it does have an elastic waist and the design is very delicately sewn and could tear easily.",pos
"I love this skirt. i usually don't buy skirts of this cut because they make me look hippy. but the fabric is so lightweight and flowing, and yet it has structure. the colors are great and go with many top options. i wear it to work and casual outings. it is my favorite clothing article in my closet right now.",pos
"I've passed this dress by a number of times online, but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo. based on the reviews, i ordered my regular size, medium. it fit perfectly. i do think the cut is on the trim side, but it isn't tight or fitted. i probably couldn't eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress. the fabric is buttery soft! the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat. there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so",pos
"Super cute blouse- great with a jean jacket, - sleeved or sleeveless. pleating is neat and a nice unique detail, without getting to full. usually a 4 or small in blouses, bought the xs. made this decision based on the arm hole openings, seemed a little large and set low on the small. .",pos
Great dress that is very flattering. works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels. perfect for travel because the material doesn't wrinkle. would highly recommend this dress!,pos
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) - 32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly with just a bra on underneath, when zipped up. i plan on wearing tank tops or thin t-shirts under it, and leaving it unzipped. i'm normally a size 10, but at retailer, i'm a 12 in their jackets.

2. thin with a thin lining, but stiff enough to hold its shape. the front zipper also helps give firmness to the front edge.

3. the fabric is white with lots of beige embroidery and lace holes.

"I got these jeans on sale and have been very happy with them. they seem to go with everything - just a really nice basic skinny jean to have. lightweight with a little bit of give. they fit tts for me, and hit about an inch and a half longer on my legs than the model in the picture (i'm 5'6""). i've had them for a couple of months now and keep expecting them to show some wear in the knees bc of how often i wear them. not yet! any marks on them have come off easily in the wash. overall, very happy",pos
This dress is so flattering and comfortable. i got the green which is not too green. this is the perfect dress for a spring day and can be dressed up or dressed down.,pos
Looks professional but wears like a sweater! so comfy!,pos
"I love the coh fleetwood jeans, and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans, i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods, which are a substantial weight denim, these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in, these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.",neg
"Such a cute skirt- but impossible to get on. ordered in an xs (i have a 25/26 waist) but could barely get it past my knees to step into. if you have any hips at all, unfortunately this skirt won't work. i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small.",neg
I absolutely love this dress. it's great quality and fits perfectly.,pos
This is a great cut and looks good on. it is a very poor quality material. it balled and frayed in two wears. i returned it to the store.,neg

"I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it's soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it's comfortable so that's a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though!",neg
Great color and fit and feminine,pos
"I bought the red cardigan because i didn't have anything similar and was so pleasantly surprised by the fit and design that i'm going have to buy it in whatever other colors are available. it's very versatile - looks great tied in front, in back, at the side - and has a tiny bit of flare at the bottom so it's more feminine and flirty than your average cardigan. i have a few tops by this brand and have been really happy with the quality and design.",pos
"Love the skirt, colors are nice, fabric is thick enough to go to fall, but not too thick for summer (ti is short, so has room). the colors are somewhat ""brighter"" in person, but not summer bright, more fall bright, not sure htat makes sense). love the flower pattern, it is pretty but strong at the same time.

I love this top. i typically wear small in most retailer tops and decided to size down in this to an xs and i'm glad i did. well made and cute floral design that can be worn year round.,pos
Great style - can be dressed up or down.,pos
Saw this tee on line and thought i'd give it a shot - the fit is very complimentary and the material is heavenly! i get lots of raves about the casual yet pretty style too. great shirt!,pos
"So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived! i was sooo excited! but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt. with my long torso things are generally too short on me. i'm a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under 40 bucks:/ i say that, yet i'm not sending it back:)",pos

"I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one. i've been eyeing this online for quite some time, so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price. it came in the mail the other day. it's like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door, however, this time wasn't so great. the top is fine. average at best. the top fits true to size. maybe it's the pattern or the cut, but it didn't work well on my body. i recommend trying this on first.",neg
"Very pretty and delicate top. it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered ""bib"" style. the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton, just that part (the back) could be a little thicker so more durability. still as it is, it's a niece piece and good quality.
i find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in. since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin",pos

Love this t. i now have all the colors. it is so soft and comfortable. great with jeans or dressed up with leggings and boots. and when i feeling lazy i just keep it on and use it as a night shirt to sleep in. it's that comfortable! i found the size to be spot on.,pos

Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body,pos
"I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back.  the texture is nice but let's call them what they are- thin, leggings.  not worth the price in my opinion.  honestly, i can't seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so i'd spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans.",neg
"This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter, though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it's pretty loose, but doesn't look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don't want your bra to show through.",pos
"I definitely would recommend this top. when i put it on i felt it was true to size, and fit me very well. sometimes my retailer tops tend to be a little roomy, but not in this case. the fit was very nice and its embroidery details make it a special look that i can throw on with my jeans and still look put together. i know this will be a top i wear often.",pos
I loved this top so much i bought both colors! soft and warm without being too thick or bulky.,pos
"These are lovely, dressy pants, but they act larger than they need to (even for the model above, see photos). i usually order size 8-10 in pants, and size 10 in these fit at the waist but felt bulky below, partly because of large pockets made of the same material. another detail to note: there is metallic thread running thru out the material, glinting more than the photos show. the golden vertical leaflets don't show as much, because of the overall shine. so i will return these lovelies, because",pos

I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.,pos
"Quality piece except the fit is way off. i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso, larger on the bottom. i ordered the small. i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area. however, the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame. i marked it as running small, which it does on top, but then it runs very large on bottom. wanted it to work, but didn't.",neg
"I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.",neg
The most beautiful top in my closet and i have a huge closet of beautiful clothes! hope retailer carries more peasant top by this brand...stunning,pos
"I love this shirt! i wore it to a friend's baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it. the neckline and shoulders and very flattering, but then i'm not very busty, so maybe that's why it worked for me. the material is hand-wash only, but well worth it for such a unique, pretty top. i also didn't get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff.",pos
"Don't know why but i didn't have high expectations for this dress. turns out it's uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny, accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36, 5'8"" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett",pos
"This is such a lovely piece. i usually wear a medium in moth. i am 135 pounds and 5'4"". the quality is exceptional. i highly recommend this sweater coat.",pos
The colors of this top are even better in person. the blue is easy to pair with denim and there is no need to accessorize -- the print does all the talking! it is a bit wide on the bottom and the print material is pretty thin. it definitely looks like something not everyone else has - worth the splurge.,pos
"I bought this top in ivory and love it! i'm 5'5"" 125lbs and 32dd. i usually wear a small or 4 but sized up to a 6..i have no issues with the fabric!! this is a steal for the sale price.",pos
"As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.",pos
"These pants are just what i wanted to work out in- something bright, cheery, and feminine. they're super comfortable and fit perfectly. i'm typically a 2, so i ordered the xs, and they are just right.",pos
"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.",pos
"I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style, but i returned it immediately. it runs so large! the colors are faded, and the trim of the shirt curl over, so it looks cheap and frumpy. i do not recommend this! it hits in all the wrong places.",neg
This top fits so well and looks much better on than in the picture.,pos
This shirt is a simple but versatile top. it goes anywhere with anything so it's a great travel piece. i'm curvy on top but short waisted and this shirt does a good job of disguising that figure flaw. i got loads of compliments from men who liked the femininity that stops short of 'sugary' as one guy put it. it's quite comfortable and doesn't bunch up when one sits down. i wore it with copper jewelry and that really made it 'pop.' a great piece for one's wardrobe.,pos
"This dress is very pretty, versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up, i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite, this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable. (i have this dress in ivory top)",pos
This is a delightfully soft and fluffy sweater. i might have bought it if my store had the petite size. the white was pretty and a good weight (not too light or heavy) and comfortable. it would be fun to layer over various outfits. it did not seem to shed.,pos
It was huge. material looked good but was too bulky. will be returning it.,neg
"I, sadly, only noticed this top once on sale. i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big, i would need the petite, so i had to leave it behind (115 lbs, 30dd) - but it is adorable, can be dressed up and classy, casually with jeans, or sweetly, so many ways... love the subtle polka dots... oh well, i am sure i will find something similar i love!",pos
The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,neg
"Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews, even with the sale price and addtl discount. it's basically $30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse. the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily. if it were black, you could probably get away with it, but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle. sad to have to send it back.",neg
"I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings, and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin, i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!",pos
"This dress is magical. i wore it to a christmas party and felt like the belle of the ball. my dress swirled around me as i spun on the dance floor. later, i spilled a tequila-ginger all over the front. i was devastated, but it almost instantly dried and there are no stains!!! you can't even tell i spilled! it is hand-washable, which is great as well! i am 4'11 and 100lbs. the xxsp fit like a glove.

highly recommend! any other dress would have been ruined but this one was literally magical.",pos
"Saw this in the store and had to have it after i tried it on. it's shape is unique, it's very ""floaty"" and looks awesome with skinny cropped jeans & chunky sandals. 
the ""empire"" does hit across the breast line, not below. i thought it added to the different shape, & didn't look odd on me. i am 5'6"" so it might overwhelm a petite frame.",pos
"This dress is so pretty in person. the colors are great - the blue and green and just beautiful in person. the fit is tts. i happen to have a blue belt and could style it just as the model has, but really it doesn't need it. it is super flattering even without a belt. i am just a hair shy of 5'5"", and i cannot wear flats or it would drag the floor. but adding a 2 1/2"" wedge is perfect to keep it off the floor (no hemming needed). i don't usually pay full price, but i am glad i did in this case.",pos
"Truly. adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned, much better in person than as pictured. the ivory has black, khaki and light pink polka dots. it is great with a pencil skirt or pants.",pos
"Loved this dress. it does run a little long even with 3"" high heels. i am5 '3"", and probably would have been
better with a petite size. often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size. i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side. i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit. not sure if i will hem it. the print is pretty; however, busy. i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic. i added an black belt, w",pos
"This ran a bit small; i'm normally a 2, this was a 4 and 'just' fit. the pattern was very 'digi,' the length was shorter than i hoped (i'm 5'1""), and the fabric, while structured, was just cheap and acrylic-feeling. pass.",neg
"The top is adorable, but probably better to wait for a sale as the full price is a little high for a simple top like this. i got the print one and it's very true to size.",pos
"Maeve did it again! great material, vivid color and amazing fit. i tried this dress on 2 weeks ago but didn't purchase. when i saw that they were having a sale i couldn't get to the store quick enough!
ladies, if you're bottom heavy like i am then this dress will make you look awesome!",pos
"This cardigan is light weight and can be used for all seasons. additionally, you can wear it tied in the front or down for a cascade look. can be worn for the office or with jeans. love this little good for everything closet staple!",pos
"So glad i bought this!! its beautiful and being on sale made it even better. good quality and versatile, highly recommend.",pos
"I wasn't sure about the dress on the rack. lace can either look amazing or make you look like a doily. it was on sale so i figured why not? let's try it on. it is gorgeous on. true to size. i am usually a 0 and the 0 fits me perfectly. the quality and tailoring is amazing. it is a heavier dress with the lace and lining so it may not work on a super hot day. overall, i love the fit and quality of the dress. i love it even more on sale!",pos
"What a beautiful dress! a size 2 fit me perfectly- 5'5 120lbs. i have a small ribcage so it works on me but it might be too tight for someone with a larger one. the fabric is of amazing quality and i was so glad to see there is a liner under the skirt. the top has some delicate beading which looks great but i am concerned it will fall off at some point. i have found that retailer clothing tends to have loose buttons and beading. i have not washed it yet so i am hoping it holds up. otherwise, i am",pos
"I caught a sneak peak of this beautiful dress on a local retailer instagram page...and i was so excited when it arrived at my store. i love this dress! i went with the black because i loved how bold it was. it's ultra feminine and flowy. the slip underneath has the prettiest embroidered print and the overlay is light and airy. the bottom is hemmed with a little lace peekaboo and it is wonderful. i tried this on in both a l and an xl. the xl fit well but the dress was a little long on top, so i wen",pos

This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out,pos
"I remember the first time i walked into an retailer store: like walking into a dream of all my favorite things. i've finally found a store whose products help me to express myself. as a writer, i love whimsical & out of the ordinary. i have found my honey hole. every time one of the pastel bags w/ribbon handles is past over the counter or i push 'add to cart' on my computer, i do a little happy dance in my heart. my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets & treats. thank you retailerp",pos
I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.,pos
"This casual top is adorable! a great top for jeans, linen pants or shorts! it would be cute with skirts too. 
i love the heavy feel of the fabric. too many fabrics today are thin and/or clingy. this is soft, but is substantial. it works well on my body-type. tall, thin, without much figure. it's not cheap, but something i'll likely keep for a few years.",pos
"This is a beautiful, artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously, rosie neira is a talented, london-based designer, who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning, the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8, medium top, 34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label, the flowing front drape and slightly longer back, the gorgeous knit quality and design, and the way it makes m",pos

"I bought this jacket in green and it is beautiful. the green is a true
forest green. sizing is accurate. my only wish is that they offered more colors and the snaps were double faced so you could snap the collar back.",pos
"This is beautiful - the colors are rich (though the pink is slightly more noticeable than the model image. the length was just shy of my knees at 5'7"", and the fit was overall swingy. i am happy with my normal size s, though i would be curious to see how the xs fits too. i suspect that it would be too tight in the shoulders but fit everywhere else better. one major difference that slightly annoys me is that the sleeves are not long as shown in the model shot. the flared portion starts at about m",pos
"I love the design on this top. it's a little thin, but it's held up great with a few washes.",pos
"I love this t-shirt - the moss green color is just what i wanted, cute fit and true to size. purchased the medium b/c i like t-shirts to be a little loose.",pos
"Easy to wear, but still has a lot of style. i see this becoming a new basic.",pos
"After reading all the reviews i thought i would have to size up. went into my local retailer and found this dress in a size 4 burnt orange color (last one in stock). it was still marked $79 so i think thats why it was still there.. i crossed my fingers and tried it on, it fit perfect! not to short or tight in the upper sleeve. i'm 5'4"" so maybe that's why the lenght was fine on me. if you can find this in your local store try it on. it's really cute and comfortable. i also have the front lace up j",pos
"I'd been eyeing this for months, loving the look but afraid it'd be too young for me (i'm 58). i tried it on in the store and loved it, with one caveat: it hangs rather like a sack, so i think it needs a belt for waist definition. with a belt, it looks great. my measurements are 38-30-38 and i wear a medium. oh, and contrary to what other reviewers have said, i don't find that the fabric is too thin or transparent.",pos
I have been looking for a cuddly yet nice looking sweater like this one for a long time. i love anther as they always deliver what i am looking for.,pos
"I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect, so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom, the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...",pos
"The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.",pos
"Love the pattern and material (not thick) for spring and summer.  like the fit and style. i'm 5'2"", 115#. i've purchased regular (not petite) front and side zip (with internal button) charlie trousers earlier this year and last year.  got a size 4 (i vary between size 2 and 4) in the front zip trousers and they stretched out and got a little loose after fitting perfectly.  so i got the side zip in size 2.  those were tighter initially and stretched out but are still snug.  with this particular p",pos
Beautiful dress; i ended up getting it in both the red and the green. the fit is absolutely perfect and it flatters pretty much any figure. one thing i would say is that you should get your exact size if possible; i ordered it online because it was so pretty in the 4p. i happened to be in the store the next week and i ttried on the 4r in the store just to see how it looked and it was awful! i was so disappointed but then my dress arrived in the mail and the 4p fit me perfectly. i'm so glad retailer,pos
"I saw this jacket in stores, but did not buy it. i went home, but could not get this trendy jacket out of my head. i returned to the store the very next day and purchased this item. i am very pleased with the quality and think that the fit could go well on most body types. i got the denim color, which may not be the best color for all, but i love it because denim is timeless and very versatile. i would suggest this to anyone and could not be happier with this! go out and buy it now, you won't re",pos
"The design of this dress was very off for my 5'4"", 120 lb, 32d frame. it's low-cut and tight in the bust, but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips, making me look wide there. a belt didn't help much. the fabric is nice, but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy.",neg
"The shape is awkward, too loose, not flattering. my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasn't as cute as online. returning this one.",neg
"I bought the navy/ivory patterned one in size 16. i loved the details of the faces so much that i ordered a second one in the same pattern on sale. now, i see they're still available on clearance so i have a 3rd (the ivory with pastel stripes). the length is perfect. it's comfortable, washes well, and has personality. i love these. i should have bought the other whimsical prints. i've had good use out of them this summer and will in the colder months too.",pos
Awesome jeans. cute and comfortable! size down as they run a little big.,pos
"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",neg
I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!,pos
"Not as pink as pictured online, definitely more of a pale peach. fits loose, so i'm glad i went with my normal size, or would seem boxy. cute top, and will wear it around town running errands..instead of my activewear!",pos
Super easy date or work dress. it's a little small in the bust so i had to size up but otherwise a great fit.,pos
Love this top! off the shoulder fits great! little extra room around the torso than i'd love... but still absolutely in love with this top! the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing! love the colors for fall! ordered a small and i'm 5'9 138lbs and i ordered a small,pos
"This is so pretty in person and really nice quality with soft velvet, stitched on beading is very firmly sewn on, great fit. runs a tad small (i am a curvy size 8 but as with many flowy/swingy retailer tops i needed a small to not be swimming in it). perfect with skinny jeans and booties and can't wait to wear it this holiday season.",pos
"As other reviewers said, this top is rather boxy. but i assumed it ran big, ordered a size down, & i love it. i ended up buying it in both black & white. personally, i don't find it too short. it hits (on me) just below the waist of my jeans - it covers up my tummy - which no one needs to see - but still looks youthful. the little ruffle detail & front seam take it from boring basic to something special enough to feel put together by just pairing with cute jeans. i generally wear a 14 & 38dd bra",pos
Runs a bit tight around upper arms. love the collar.,pos
"This sweater is stunning. it is extremely well made. tons of tiny little embellishments that get noticed even by the most discerning eye! i've received so many compliments on it. if you want it to fit generously or with extra roominess, i recommend ordering one size up. it fits true to size.",pos
"Love this layering piece! a little low cut for my personal comfort, but a tank underneath works great.",pos
"I adore these jeans! i bought them in a size 31 but probably could have gone with a 30. i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased. the fit is flattering. the color is perfect! i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits. the waist is a little higher than i'm used to, but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the ""sagging out"" issue that my older paige skinny jeans have.

i love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes. mo",pos
Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.,pos
I have trouble finding pants that are long enough and also narrow enough on my hips. these fit like a glove and never stretch out.,pos

I love pajama pants by this company. i have a couple now and they are all so soft and lightweight.,pos
"Pretty obsessed with this top. it feels like a cotton, poncho. it's definitely made to be over-sized and flowy. it even hangs off the shoulder some. it does run very large. i'm normally a medium to a large and i purchased the xs (never ever an xs normally). even still it's loose as it's designed to be. so definitely size down 2 sizes. other than that super comfy and a casual top that can be worn to make my leggings and flip flops a little more ""fancy"". would also be nice with jeans for a casual",pos
I love this shirt!!! i ordered a medium and the sleeves were very long and the shirt was wide in general. i returned it for a small and it is perfect. size down! i love the comfy gauzy feel of this shirt.,pos

"My imagination went wilt with all of the possible combinations for this vest. dressy and casual...with jeans or slacks; long or short pencil; leather too!
best gift to date.",pos

I was feeling defeated in my search for a dress for some upcoming holiday parties while shopping today. i saw this dress in the dressing room as another customer was trying it on. she was a shorter petite woman and this dress looked amazing on her. it instantly caught my eye and it looked great on her! i went and was lucky enough to find a size 10. lately i've been closer to a 12 sadly and was worried this was going to be another bust. i'm 5/11 and much curvier than the woman i saw in the dressi,pos
"Just received this and absolutely love it! i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same (since online exclusive), which it does. this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees, a fence and sheep on the sleeve - very cute. it's a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style. it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely. there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off.",pos

"What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips, but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!",pos

"This really was nothing special. for $68 there are much cuter tops at retailer. it wasn't particularly flattering as it was very boxy, so it added volume. it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice. i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big. overall, this was just a miss for me.",neg
I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews. the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didn't work for me. something about it reminded me of seinfeld's pirate shirt. i appreciate retailer's return policy. i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc.,neg

I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back,neg

This is such a great addition to my fall wardrobe. this is so cute! i'm 5'9 and this fits perfectly. i don't usually do well with some of the cropped pieces but this one has such a complementary cute. the sleeves are just the right length. i've had lots and lots of complements on this one! it's a keeper!,pos

"This top was just not flattering. i'm 5'8"" and medium build, and the m was very bulky and the fabric didn't fall in the right places. made me look very round and i'm not, so it's definitely going back!",neg
Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.,pos
"I love this suit! the fit is incredible. 

i'm unsure that the fabric will stand the test of time, but i got it on sale, and i don't know about you ladies but ill do anything for a great suit!",pos
Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it,neg
"I purchased this sweater in red, it's a deep, rich color and although i usually opt for black, you can see the beautiful details on this sweater much better in the red. i love this item!",pos
"The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.",neg
I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money. i wear a size 2p. was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress. for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up. the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on--- thick and heavy. the overall fit was too big and very unflattering.,neg
"I thought the dress was ok, but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress. i will send back, also a bit too high waisted for me. other than that, the dress is as it appears.",neg
This top is my favorite of the season! planning to order in black too.,pos
"When i was finally able to find my size available online, i didn't hesitate. i am 5'4"", 123lbs, 34d and size 27 jeans. i originally ordered a small...wow! was i surprised it was too small, and cropped. i returned and ordered a medium, received today...and i have to say, i was super happy. it fit perfect, in fact it fit much like how the model's fit in the photographs.",pos
"Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer, and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.",pos
"A great casual top for warm weather - the linen ensures its structure stands out, and the structure gives it more interest than a plan tee. does a fine job of hiding minor midsection lumpiness. can be dressed up a bit if worn with linen or cotton trousers. i bought the yellow and was pleased to find it wasn't too transparent. i bought the small and found it tts for an american small (bigger than a uk or european small). a versatile keeper.",pos
"I absolutely love this dress! very well made, fits like a glove, and very flattering! the fabric is stretchy which makes the fit perfect and comfortable. i will be wearing this to a graduation and i'm sure i'll find many other occasions to wear this dress.",pos
"Bought the gray online just to try it and i've already worn it 3 times! very soft, love the flowiness, and the scoop in the back gives it a slightly less casual touch without losing comfort. the only concern i have is that it may pill up a little and not sure how it will hold up in the wash. i'm 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size small was perfect (true to size).",pos
This darling dress has a fun boho vibe to it and the color/pattern would flatter a variety of skin tones. a long necklace is a must with this dress. it has a flowy drape below the waist so it's a generous fit. i purchased the medium.,pos
I got this for my daughter (teen) who had been wanting this plaid look but didn't want to look like a lumberjack! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down. it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase! new item but black friday discount! yay! purchased in red color.,pos
"I absolutely love the color, cut and style of this maxi. the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering! the color and design is gorgeous as you'd expect from rana gill. i got my normal size 8 and it was perfect. i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress",pos
"This sweater is so cute and seems high quality. i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste, going down just below my mid section. i wish it had been cut longer- i would have kept it.",neg
"This duster is light weight - good for a inside a chilly restaurant, but not really warm enough for cold outdoor winter weather.

really punches up a black on black outfit. polished, artsy, interesting look. runs large. has a feel similar to a swing coat - with less swing.

i've received many compliments on this piece. wear it with confidence - it is on the bold side.",pos
"I love this sweater because it is so versatile! it looks casual with jeans, but i plan to wear it to the opera with dressy black slacks. the beautiful black embroidery is unusual and asymmetrical in back.",pos
I ordered this dress for my daughter. she wore it to a wedding and it was beautiful. looks just as it does in photo. fabric is a nice weight and hangs great. my daughter had her hair done and look right out of an retailer catalog. well made true to size beautiful dress!!!!!!!,pos
"I love this jacket. i'm 6' tall, 160lbs, 30"" waist and a 34d. i normally go for an 8/medium and i bought a medium. i love it! slightly cropped, barely snug fit but i can still snap it closed. totally warm enough for california fall/winter. i like that the sleeves don't have sherpa in them... make it easier to layer! i bought the ""silver"" corduroy and it's less white than the photos, but it still fits the bill perfectly. love that it's machine washable, too. it also has pockets!",pos
"This is a great summer dress. i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies. i kept the l because the fit was better. the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful. lots of compliments, it is lined, highly recommend.",pos
"Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all, which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.",pos
"This pants the worst short that i ever had!!
i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!
i was really shock definetly will return it to store.
fyi, i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.",neg
"Tried this on in the store in a small (i'm a size 6 in most retailer dresses) and it was enormous. i'm short (5'2"") so i knew i'd need a petite size. ordered a petite small and the length is better - still a lot of fabric, but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top (i'm a full 34d and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust). definitely size down in this or you'll be swimming in it!",pos
"I'm so glad i bought this. the picture doesn't do it justice. it's lightweight, flowy and super comfy. i'll be wearing this all the time. very lightweight so it doesn't get hot. love the material, it's soft, light and flattering! color says light grey but it does have a bit of a blue/lavender hue to it as another reviewer said. i love cloth & stone and this is one of my favorites! well worth the money!",pos
"This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it's a really warm dress too, so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.

it's so comfortable and it's made with high quality material. i'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it's a pretty straight cut.",pos
"-this was actually at my local retailer store. it reminded me of another online exclusive that was a dress and had the same flower shapes but the color was a soft pink; this is exactly like that.

pros:
- it is so lovely with the pleated front",pos
"I ordered the ivory in size xl. it is such a cute, comfortable top. all of the details are well-done. the quality of the material is great too. it's a flowy fit. after washing & air-drying, it does shrink a bit. great tee for summer!",pos
"I'm a sucker for beaded detailing, so i couldn't resist this blouse. it's so beautiful and fun! i can't wait to wear it!",pos
I found this in your store and had to have it! i wore it on a date night and received more compliments than i can count!!!! the attention to detail makes this jacket special. i am 5 ft 5 inches 124lbs and a 4fits but a 6 is perfect for a sweater underneath. i actually went back a bought the other color. worth every penny.,pos
I am in between sizes (and styles) after having a baby. this dress looks great on my curvy figure and enhances my look with the cinching of the belt and the detail of the flutter sleeves. perfect length and really fits well. i am very happy with it!,pos
Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.,pos
I love these jeans. they are flattering and don't sag after wearing them for a hour or two. they look great with flats or booties.,pos
"A great white blouse! i expected this top to be sheer and yet it's quite opaque. i bought the white in a size small, i find it true to size and the silhouette is very flattering. relaxed yet super polished look.",pos
I have a love and hate with fit and fashion. i love super beautiful clothes that are comfortable to wear. normally i am the one everyone keeps asking where did you buy that and i inwardly roll my eyes because my rule of thumb is dress with the most comfortable thing i can. now i'm also a full figured mama. these outfit made me look chic parisian and made my derriere look like it was very attractive. i have a long torso and a long neck and long legs and it hid my flaws. so if you want to look lik,pos
These are my favorite flare jeans! they have that lovely 70's style and go with everything and look great all year round. the fit is perfect. my all time favorite jeans.,pos
"Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes. this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee. it was baggy, hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless.",neg
Love the material and how the back is longer than the front! adds style!,pos
"I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming, and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned, and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also, it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!",pos
"I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer, but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice, flattering drape. i'm 5'3"", 110lbs., 32c, petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length.",pos
"I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the",pos
"I absolutely love this top! i often shop the sale items first, but when i saw this top in the store, i didn't hesitate to pay full price. the material reminds me of vintage clothing - it is a dry clean only item, but is so special that it's worth it. the colors and construction (beautifully lined, bias trim) are impressive. and, this top looks better on me than on the model:)",pos
"I was hesitant to buy but this tee is easy, light, and fun to wear.  the fabric is light but not see through in the slightest.  the construction is perfect.  it is tts for an oversized tee.",pos
"This wool jacket actually feels more as a cardigan, its a little too thin for a jacket but looks about the same as pictured. its very pretty. i ordered a l and it was true to size. sleeves are cropped. the wool material is surprisingly soft and comfortable. very nice and colorful addition to my closet. recommend! :)",pos
Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it.,pos
"I'm 5'4"" 125 lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel",pos
"I got this in white and was surprised to see that it fits me. i am very petite but with a 32d bust and purchased the xxs. this fit me perfectly! the fabric is soft and kind of silky, the straps were not too long, the hem hit just at my hip line. i am buying the other color!",pos
"This is a thick material, but it is also airy. i got the white and don't have to worry about it being see through. it is a little boxy, but the hem hits a good length and doesn't bother me. really great for work in the summer and going between really hot and really cold temperatures. a good basic piece that can be dressed up or down that is definitely worth getting.",pos
"This is the most beautiful dress ever! i'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest. this dress feels like it was made for me. i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming. i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest. the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made. while the lining might be too short for tall girls, being only 5""1, the lining is perfect. the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so",pos
"Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed. i am swimming in the xs (5'4"", 110lbs). the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics - the green is a bright kelly green, the red is much more red than rust colored, etc. and it's a sweater coat! for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality. i don't doubt that it will be warm, but can't justify the price. it's going back to the store.",neg
"This. this you have to buy! i just tried it on in our new store the other night and am in love. gorgeous details went into the sweater coat. it's thinner than most, which is nice when you want to look lovely but don't quite need to bundle up! i plan on purchasing after christmas if it's still around!",pos
"This top is lace done extremely well, i love the silk, the double attached layer, and the length. dress it up or down, this top is a definite show stopper.
it does run small in the arms though, size up!",pos
"The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.",pos
I ordered these culottes because they looked comfortable yet elegant. they are indeed both!,pos
"This vest is not only stylish and beautiful, it also has pretty specks of blue and rust and other colors. will go with so much. i love the collar, not too big, not too small, just right. frames the face nicely. can wear with dresses, can wear with skirts, can wear with jeans, can wear with cords, the list is endless. this will make any outfit look pulled together. the accompanying belt or sash hits at hip level, i personally like it more at waist level so i remove the belt and wear without it. f",pos
"This top is gorgeous and beautifully made. however, the fit leaves a lot to be desired. the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin. i tried to make this work but just couldn't, so it's going back.",neg
"Ok, this shirt is like my dream.  it's large, comfy but sexy with the back dip.  as a larger chested lady (32g), i really appreciate having a tee that i can easily throw on and look put together.  clearly, this is a larger, styled swing tee but it's one of my favorites.  paired with a cute pair of boots, and easily worn with a jacket.  it can tend to fall off the shoulders so i'd size down.  i'll probably pick up the grey too.",pos
"I ordered these joggers in holly size m. for reference, i am 5'5, 138 lbs, i have a small waist with *thicker* thighs and bum. i was worried that these would make all my ""flaws"" stand out as so many joggers in the past have, but these are not that way at all! they are so comfy and just right! they could easily be dressed up or down. these joggers could quickly replace your everyday jeans or black leggings habit to add a new, more stylish twist!",pos
"Very flattering. fits tts. love the colors. does not give any lift up or support to breasts.i am a 36 c and i was fine with this. it is so flattering to back and overall a flattering fit i was ok with my breast not being supported and uplifted. if you want support this is not for you. it does look exactly as it does on model in regard to coverage showing some cleavage but very little. i am 5'6"" 127 lbs and not very fit and took a medium. my husband really loves this suit and gave it two big thum",pos
This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!,pos
Love these pants. very flattering. not much stretch. the rear waist band is elastic with minimal stretch and not visible to others. they are long but wearable with the right heels.,pos
"I got this top in white and absolutely love it. the top can be tucked in or worn out, it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans. can't wait to wear it.",pos
"I bought this top in black, and it fits my body type really well. it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently. the black top is really slimming and is a great cut. i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me, but this top is definitely a great length.",pos
I love this jacket and the price was a great bonus. it fit perfectly and is nice cozy and warm. well made and the beige color is great.,pos
"Beautiful dress. not lined, but the fabric is sturdy enough. i do prefer a slip under but that is my preference for most things. great for dressing up or down. so comfortable.",pos
"Love this blazer! combines a chic, pulled together look with super soft, comfortable material. will be great for the office and the weekend. runs a little big?am typically a large or xl, so i ordered the xl and had to exchange for a large. might have actually been able to size down to a medium, but didn't want to deal with the back and forth again.",pos
Love this piece! lots of versatility and the pattern is lovely. wear it alone or with leggings and boots.,pos
"I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders,  it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders, and we'll endowed,  but the large was perfect.",pos
"I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen",pos
"A perfect go-to top. looks great with jeans - dark , faded or bright white. top it with a cardigan or wear it bare - it offers a flattering fit with its high-quality, textured fabric. i normally wear a small or medium top. an extra-small fits me perfectly.",pos
"I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses (my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later) when i bought this. once i tried this on at home, i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck, and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back. i wanted to love t",neg
"I actually like the fit - but i guess it depends on your overall body type. i too ordered a small and medium. i actually could fit the small, but preferred the room in the medium. the movement on these are spectacular and the material is light and cool.",pos
I loved the contrast of the front panels and sleeves/back of this sweater. it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater. the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed. but overall this is a lovely sweater!,pos
"I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality, unique, and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!",pos
"Great petite maxi! i'm 5'3 and it skims the top of my feet. soft, fits great and went right into my suitcase for my upcoming  trip. can dress up or down.",pos
"This coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the ""madeline"" stories. she just got her first paid internship in the city, so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate. after all, a girl has to make a good first impression...",pos
"This sweater is such a cozy knitted dream. the mixed knit contrast trim/hood adds enough visual interest to keep it unique from other incarnations out there. it's a little open work but still snuggly warm with layers. the fit is very roomy but not sloppy looking, that's why i picked 'runs large' as you'd have to size down for a somewhat slimmer look. if i could afford to buy the other color now i would. i wish retailer would commission a green version. and a brown version. red too. what the heck,",pos
"It looks adorable in the picture... but just not flattering in real life. too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy, unflattering way. makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy, rather than enhancing curves. it's a pass. love the blue print, though.",neg
"I want to be the person who lounges like the model...but this was huge and more wool-feeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for. i am an 8, got the xs/s it was the right size....i returned it.",neg
I saw this on one of the gals at my local retailer and fell in love. it is the coolest bomber and i instantly fell for it. i went with my normal l and i will be wearing this all fall and winter long it's just so unique and eye catching,pos
"I am in love with this piece! i am long waisted and large busted so finding a jumpsuit to fit me can be challenging, having said that i sized up when ordering this, wrong ladies....no need....i had to reorder my normal size and even that was roomy, but in a good way as i prefer belting it with my huge concho belts. i purchased it in the rasberry and i am still scratching my head as to why the black sold first, the red is stunning and i find it more versatile going from casual to dressy. and this",pos
"I ordered this dress, and loved, loved it. beautiful, great fabric. the length was even perfect for me and i'm 5'4"". i am usually a size 8, but ordered up to a 10 because i am a little woman with the exception of my chest. i have ordered dresses before from retailer where i had to order certain dresses a size larger and they worked. unfortunately this time, it wasn't to be. tried the dress on and it fit nicely until the side zipper got to my chest area. i would have ordered another size lar",pos
"Stunning cardigan--i love it :) they only had a size l on sale so i purchased--i'm so glad i did. could have gone with a m though; maybe even a s, but that would be cutting it, especially since i'm 5ft 11in, 133lbs. compliments keep coming and such a great piece to have in my closet.",pos
"Found this jumpsuit in standard size small/red motif (pictures don't do it justice) in-store and to my surprise, it actually fit! of course, it was billowy since i'm short/ 113lbs., and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet, which i don't mind. i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on. the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest area/near my armpits..like normal women usually have. ladi",pos
"This is just a really fun jacket. agreed with the previous reviewer that it's not the most functional. but guess what -- this is super cozy (it's lined with the softest faux fur), it's quilted in an army green, and it has the best trim along the arm. they could've cut corners on the quality here, for instance, with the beading or the material on the trim. however, they didn't cut those corners. instead, the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive. can't wait till the weather g",pos
"I love this top! yes, it is quite transparent, but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.",pos
"Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux.",pos
The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it's very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.,pos
"I am 70 years old and enjoy retailer so much for uniqueness.
this dress is not flattering in the photo..but.....
it is great on a curvy figure and i plan to wear it anywhere/everywhere i can....so flattering
from the bust to the smaller waist (though mine is definitely not small) but the skirt then
flares deligthfully. the fabric is not heavy, not too light ...just great.
easy going length...wear as is or add a crop, belt, etc....

again, the photo does not do this dress justice!!!!",pos
I absolutely love the dahlia bell-sleeve blouse. this blouse has a lovely flow. perfect for fall. sleeves have a slight bell that hang nicely. i would recommend this blouse to everyone!,pos
"This top arrived by mail this morning, it is beautiful even prettier than the picture. fits true to size and is wonderful quality. cannot wait to wear it when i leave on vacation this weekend.",pos
"This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches, it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style, not trendy so it wi",pos
"I love lace dresses and this one is no exception. great construction and color. i paired the dress with a plum colored blazer and i really was pleased at how well it all went together. i'm about 5'8"" and 170 i'm normally an 8 or 10 at retailer, my 8 fits great and is not tight at all, so i'm thinking it may run a tad bit big.",pos
"This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!",pos
Love this sweater - very soft and can be dressy or casual.,pos

can dress it up or down - it's pretty darn fabulous!
i highly recommend it - you'll be grateful and feel pretty!",pos
"Very comfortable nightgown, love that it had pockets. fit is as expected.",pos
"I bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer. even though i am normally a small/size 4 at 5'5"" & 118 lbs, i opted for the 6 because i am busty (34d). this was the right call. the dress is comfortable, flattering and i got lots of compliments. it's a keeper!",pos
"Love the detail, quality of make and fabric, comfort.  i've been looking for a top like this.  expect that it  will wash fine. it's not see through and i always wear a nude bra.  got xs in white and it fits well, not too loose and billowy.  i'm 5'2"", 115#. highly recommend.",pos
"Great, lightweight pants for summer!!! size down the length is slightly long and they stretch out throughout the day. i'm 5'8"" normally a 33 in pilcro and took a large in these. so cute",pos
"I just love everything about these jeans, and everyone that sees them on me seems to as well! i'm short (5'2"") and was concerned about the length on me because they didn't have the petite in my size- but these seem to be just fine. i wear them with a bit of a heel, so that helps. they fit snugly (but not too tight) in all the right places, i have a bit of a backside so that's a plus for me! because of the higher waist, they also don't ride down.  except for the shorter length, they remind me a l",pos
I tried this top on before it went on sale but thought the price was too high. as soon as it went on sale i scooped it up and i'm glad i did. i'm usually always a small in retailer tops and this was no exception. i'm tall and thin with a large bust but this top does not pull or bind in the chest because it's cut on the bias. it is a little low but i've been wearing it for parties. it might be too low for work depending on the setting. i don't usually wear green but this is a very muted and pretty,pos
"This jacket fits great! i got a medium, and am 5'6"" , 140 lbs. very nice light weight jacket.",pos

"I'm in love with these jeans! they come very long, but it's easy to cut them down where you want them since they are not hemmed. i have a short torso so for me they were high waisted, but still flattering, which surprised me! for reference, i am 5'2, 105#, and i got the size 24.",pos
Many complements today at work! comfortable even on days you don't want to wear something form fitting,pos

"Marking down one star because these pants do gape quite a bit when you sit down, though i appreciate the shorts underneath that prevent any indecent exposure. these could have done with a little stitch in the front or side somewhere on the leg to limit that. that said, my other similar (non-retailer) pants that are much worse and are also are bulkier on top, which does not look great at my size/with my body shape. these are more flattering (i love the band on top) and comfortable. i am normally a",pos
"This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big, as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way, the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.",pos
Hate i have to return it - way too long-almost more mid thigh/almost dress length.,neg
Sticker price was a shock but it is so worth it. it is the best little black dress i have ever owned. the lace is so soft and the dress is flattering. it is fun and flirty. this is a closet staple piece for sure!!! love this dress so much!,pos
"Absolutely love this top! yes it runs big and is flowy but i think it is very flattering, especially with skinny jeans. loved it so much i bought the navy and wine colors for myself and the green for my mom. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and the xs fit well (falls just above my mid thigh).",pos
"Ordered this dress in an xs, that is the size i usually wear. this runs small, but not only that it is the way it is cut, very small through the hips, thighs and legs. hard to walk in it. the material felt kind of cheap to me. i thought it looked really good on the model, but got it home and didn't like it at all! it went back!",neg
"While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.
there is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through. 
also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm",neg
"I read the rave reviews, but tried this on with low expectations. i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges. the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down. i am 5'6"", 135lbs and a small fit perfectly. i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today.",pos
Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets,pos
"I tried this one as a xs and xs petite, and of course ,the petite is the way to go for me. length slightly below around the knee, if i pull on the straps, then the hem hits the knees. i wish the blue was still available in petite, now that it is on sale. the waist is adjustable,and so are the straps. the material is airy like linen. pretty and flirty, and appropriate for work, can't go wrong.

"I am normally between a size 0 and 2, so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work. the 0 seemed pretty tight all around, so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist. of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out, was bagging in the crotch area, sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees. i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o",neg

"This top is beautiful in both colors, it was a difficult decision at the store. i went with the black, and my usual size s fit well with a little room, but in no way overly baggy. i tried on the xs which also fit but was a little constricting. the quality is excellent and i highly recommend this top. 1 question i have however, is that the online description says machine wash, however my tag states dry clean only. just curious if anyone has hand washed this yet? otherwise, it is a beautiful, comf",pos

Love this dress...light and comfortable and fits true to size. i have larger shoulders and the halter design is really flattering. you can dress up or dress down which is a huge plus for me!,pos
"I purchased this in the gold in-store. when i got home and saw it also came in turquoise, i ordered those right away as well. the fit is amazing. the pants are very slimming without being tight. they are a comfortable and flattering pant. i really love the colors and will probably snag another pair or two when able. these are a great pant to dress up or just look snappy casual in. they are a great versatile pant. i normally wear a size 8 and weight 155. the 29 fit perfectly.",pos

"This is a great top. soft and cozy fabric, nice and sturdy feeling. it's heavier than i though it'd be so its perfect for the cooler days of spring, and even a chilly summer night. i love that it's long enough in the front for me to feel comfortable wearing leggings. the body is nice and roomy but the arms are a little snug, however, i like that because i think it makes it look less like a slubby sweatshirt. the best part... it can be cleaned in the washer and drier! thrilled with this purchase!",pos
"One of the best tops i have ever bought! i love he material and the style. the satin trim around the edges adds a classy touch. i wore this top with yoga pants and then with jeans and it was perfect for both outfits! the shirt is true to size. i wear a size small and it fit perfectly (5'7"", 145lbs, 34b).",pos
The fitted high waist with the wide legs make for a flattering and comfortable short. perfect length as well! dress up or down. love these shorts and wish there were more colors!,pos

"What a beautiful harbinger of spring! this blouse is so lovely and uplifting. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) and it fits perfectly. this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so, i understand why some say size up. the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies. the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse. the fabric is soft but not overly sheer.",pos
I love this shirt. i bought the ivory color. it's incredibly comfortable and an easy style.,pos
"I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews, nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern, burgundy wine faux fur collar, the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did, this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!",pos
"Beautiful dress. flowing but not too much volume, not too short but not dowdy, gorgeous deep jade color with chartreuse accents, flattering waist (not sure why the model is covering that part up, but it's a nice waist with a tie belt). i think it looks really smashing in person. not too formal, perfect for a daytime event like a bridal shower.",pos
"I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online, so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers, the fit is odd, huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body, being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug",neg

This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat,pos

This is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design. it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with. looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts. it is wide but has a lovely flow/swing to it. love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe. so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top.,pos
"Excellent dress. usually i wear a oop, and this did fit great. a little snug in the chest (im a 32c), but the buttons are covered by material so it doesnt show. the waist hits perfectly. there is the right amount of skirt material to make a dramatic silhouette without looking silly. awesome dress! wish the blue or white with icecream were still available! the hot pink is a wonderful summer color though.",pos
"The dress looks great both in winter and summer, either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn't wrinkle too much.

Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.,pos

"Beautiful, feminine, flowy dress. love the brass button detail at neckline and around waist-gives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of ""edge"". had to detach the slip to get it on, but glad it is included with the dress. i purchased the small and fits like a glove (5'8"", 135lbs, 34d). can't wait to wear it!!",pos

Ordered two of these and they fit great and will be perfect for layering.  true to size fit.  cute detail in the back for a racer tank!,pos
I'm not a blazer girl but this one is perfect in the sense that it's not overly structured and stiff. it is really soft and comfortable but still holds it's shape. i am planning to wear it with a tee shirt and denim or even some leather leggings (pilcro).i can see this being dressed up for work or church. a great piece for your wardrobe. i could have taken a small but decided on the medium in case i wore something a little thicker underneath.,pos

I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!,pos
"I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on, and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering, in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned, if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely, the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer, but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous, but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes",neg

I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.,neg
I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store. i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored. it's very cute and on trend. can't wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans!,pos
"To start: i'm 135 lbs, 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress -- amazing skirt for an outstanding price! incredibly lightweight; has a stretchy-jersey lining. to fit high-waisted like the model, go down 1-2 sizes. in work slacks, i wear a size 6 or 8. however, my natural waist is small. i tried on the size 2 and the size 4. i purchased the size 2, although i still wish there was a size 0 to try on. a larger size will fit lower at the waist and will bring the midi length to ankle length.",pos
Such great detail great beautiful in red and white.,pos
I love this dress! it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch! the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath!,pos
"I absolutely love this jacket! it's one of the best things i've bought this season. the interior is so unbelievably soft. i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin. the fit is beautiful, as is the pattern. it's even better in person than in the photo. it is pricey, but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it, it's well worth it.",pos
"I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable, beautiful fabric, cute gold buttons!  as well, due to the cut, it feels roomy, but has a slender fit around the arms.  the ""denim"" color has beautiful detail, but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!",pos
"This is a beautiful sweater . it's very lightweight and sheer, so best to wear a tank or camisole underneath. also better for warmer months. i ordered the light aqua color and it's lovely.",pos
I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don't we love pockets? very practical and lightweight,pos
"This is a wonderful one-piece swim suit! it's very flattering on, and the colors and design are just lovely. i also love the suit's vintage feel and that it's sexy without being overly revealing. i seldom pay full price for clothing, but this item is definitely worth every penny!!! i bought a size medium and it fit perfectly.",pos
"This is a very classy sweater/jacket. it is a beautiful color. i had not even noticed it until it was on sale, and then read all the favorable reviews. it can be dressy or casual as seen in this photo! so glad i got it!",pos
These capri length pants are awesome!  i do recommend sizing down though as the l was really big on me (i am a 10-12 with most of my weight in my rear so normally never size down in pants)--the fabric is really nice and the print is versatile and allows wonderfully for pattern mixing.  super comfortable!,pos
"I wasn't sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on. this jacket totally worked for me. the brown color can be easily matched with other colors. i got the jacket in medium size. i usually in between size. the medium size allow more space on the chest area, however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me.",pos
"Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.",neg
It fits great. it is super comfortable. have gotten many compliments on how this skirt looks on me!,pos

Super cute! no complaints! fun print! light weight soft material!,pos
"This jacket is far more attractive than on the website. i would have passed this up had i not seen it in the store. the embroidered sleeve detail is intricate with raised cream colored stitching surrounded by small brass beads on a rich, olive green background. blue detail sets this off as a unique statement piece that will surely draw compliments. i am 5'1, 110 lbs. and the extra small regular fit fine. i considered a petite but the salesperson thought the longer length would look better so i w",pos
These jeans are adorable!  i wear a 10p and the 30 petite fit perfectly. great quality and will look cute with a boxy crop top and flats.,pos
"I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up, everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material, v-cut, and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.",pos
It is very cute. i think actual one is much better than the picture.,pos
I was initially attracted to the colors,pos
"This dress is beautiful. this is a 0 and tts. it was not clingy or tight at all (5'4"" 115lbs). it is fully lined, and i have short legs, so it was not too short for me. if you have an event you could wear this to this summer, i highly recommend.",pos
I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work. it's very comfortable and light.,pos
"I love this comfy top, and if it couldn't get any better, the pleated back makes it extra special! it is easy to thrown on and still feel put together. i purchased this top in the green and i'm absolutely enthralled by the rich color! i do agree that the quality of the pleats could be slightly better, however i believe it's up to par with the price point. i typically wear an xs/xsp and ultimately decided to go with a small for a more oversized tunic top look, but otherwise i'd go for your normal",pos
"This is a wonderful dress. i love the fit and feel of the fabric. i have been looking for a while for a 'fall' maxi to wear with a pair of free people boots i purchased. this dress is perfect with them. the colors are fall and fresh, can i say that about fall?",pos
"The fabric is beautiful.  didn't wrinkle so much after 8 hours in a suitcase.  as opposed to the other reviewer mine arrived neatly, stripes match nicely.  i am kind of thick waisted and the size 6 was still perfect for me - i am currently 130 lbs, 34-28-35.  love the colors and the fabric, a nice cotton twill, lined, pockets, pretty bow belt.  i am not a fan of the size zipper style but it is not a deal breaker.  glad i have them !!",pos
"This is a really nice quality dress. it is a low-cut v-neck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move. i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me. it's a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel. i am petite in size (5'0"" 100lbs). i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length. also, the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd. the skirt hit right at knee height.",neg
Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!,pos
So much extra fabric. not something i would recommend buying online.,neg

"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"", 160 lbs and have no hips, no butt and no waist. i have no curves and thin muscular legs. it's like wearing a cardigan and dress all in one. i paired it with ivory tights and dark brown boots and received tons of compliments.",pos
"I thought this would look great with skirts, but all my skirts are too dressy for this t-shirt. that's really all it is -- a nothing-special t-shirt. and it runs so big! i'm usually a large or xl in tops, but for this one i bought a medium, and it's still too big. i think a small would have been fine. but, as i mentioned, it doesn't go with any of my skirts, so it's not worth looking for a small.",neg
"This top does run large. i'm 5'8 142 lbs and usually a medium. i bought a small and probably could have gone xs. that said, i love this top. its soft and comfy and swingy. i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color.",pos
I went with the xs because i didn't want the v neck in the front to be too low. it looks cute paired with a kimono and a necklace.,pos
"Great little spring top. the fabric is soft and the drape is of the fabric is just right. it is very loose without making it look like a maternity top and the length hits me right at the top of the hipbone. for reference i am in my 50's, 5'1"" and weigh in the150's. i normally wear medium size and this one was no exception. the blue is a beautiful cobalt color.",pos
"I love the fleetwood style...very trendy...fit like a dream - very long for you leggy gals. me, i need to hem (these would also look cute as cutoffs for us shorties)...true to size - slim fit!",pos

Love this dressed up casual tshirt. perfect casual friday shirt or going out for happy hour with the girls.,pos

"This is the first romper i have have purchased and is so cute! i am in between a small and a medium usually (5'7, 135 lbs and athletic). the medium fit okay, but with some extra fabric--the small fit better and was much more flattering. the romper feel well-made. can't wait to wear it!",pos
"I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side, so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side, after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands, i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other",pos
"This sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater. it runs tts however if you like the short length then i'd size down. i'm 5'4, 120# 34d and the xs was perfect. the sweater didn't feel too scratchy but it's not a soft sweater. very feminine.",pos
"Has to be one of my favorite retailer purchases! the shirt is so soft and can be paired with so many different items. the turtle neck will help keep you warm, although the actual material is a little thin. don't let that dissuade you though. you won't be disappointed by this purchase! i'm going to get the other color too :)",pos
"This dress was returned to our store and i was intrigued the second i saw it. the dress is definitely oversized. so much so that you could probably size down a size or two. but what i love about this dress is the style. its meant to be oversized...and with the print, the asymmetric cut and the oversized look...its very unique! the color is exactly as it appears and the material is wonderful. thin but soft and comfortable...really easy to wear! you could do this as a dress, or with leggings and b",pos

pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.
- nice length. fit me as in the model.
- very slimming.
- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi",pos
I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!,pos

"Loved the idea of this - unfortunately, it disappointed all around. it's way too short and ran small. the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap. the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece. usually an retailer small (5""7"" 140 lbs 32dd) but ordered a medium (small would not have fit in this piece). do not recommend.",neg
"The first reviewer was right about this dress--checked her review before buying it. it's a beautiful creation and perfectly designed, and it's also slimming. i was worried that the fit might be too tight in the skirt, but it is fine. highly recommended.",pos
"Regretfully, this dress is on its way back for an exchange. the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size, i ordered it in both colors, however, the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress, and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom. again, the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching, pulls , or tears for an exchange, but i can't pay 130"" for a dress that is already torn.",neg
"Trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts. never thought i'd find both in one top. love this! i put it on and knew i had to take it home. it's fitted but not, busy but just enough so, and it's made in the usa! can't go wrong.",pos
"Love, love, love this little lbd!
lots of rich detail and still very easy and laid back. dress up or dress down.
i will be wearing this into the fall season. i purchased the l, still roomy, tried the m but a little snug in the shoulders and chest. i am usually a size 12, d cup. very flattering style boho chic.",pos
"These are gorgeous and not too short or too long which is oddly hard to find! they're mostly tts, but if you're between sizes i'd go up a size because the small was slightly snug on me and i'm a 4/6. i'm hopeful that they'll stretch a little with wear because i think the medium would be too loose.",pos
"I'm a 32dd, so i wouldn't normally wear a bralette out of the house (not enough support). this bralette is actually very supportive and comfortable. i'm probably going to get at least one more. for reference, i'm a 32dd (small back, big boobs) and a small fit me extremely well.",pos

"This is a great top. i love how it's loose and hangs away from my body but is banded at the bottom so it isn't shapeless. the tie at the neck is cute and gives it some personality.

i usually bounce between a s or xs. i tried the xs in the store but ordered the s.",pos
I agree with all of the reviews. the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on.! the buttons are a nightmare! whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off. ridiculous! they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it. so so so disappointing,neg

This flared skirt caught my attention the first time it came up in the website.  i am more a florals and lace kind of girl but the flattering shape and stripes kept me going back to it agin and again.  i finally saw it in person at my store and needed to try it on.  perfect! the colors are matte and not metallic as i thought based on the website photo.  you can definitely dress it down with a chambray too or t shirt.  i wore it to a work meeting and can't wait to wear it again.  it's a bit on th,pos

"I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top, no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.",pos
"This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least.",pos

This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.,pos

I can't tell you how many compliments i get on this gorgeous sweater/poncho! there are tiny glimmery threads woven into it that make it so fun for dressing up. i wore it to a fall holiday party and it was perfect! it's a little on the itchy side... but the shirt i wore underneath solved the problem. the colors are so gorgeous... deep and rich. love this piece!,pos

"I love this top!!! it is soft, flattering, and beautifully cut/designed. i get so many compliments every time i wear it. i have the blue and the green, and wish they had the white in my size. beautifully elegant and can be dressed up or down. best purchase i ever made at retailer!!!",pos
I love white blouses in the summer. this one is perfect. bought one size down and it is perfect. the lovely tailored neck is very flattering and hard to find. i do send it to the cleaners just to make sure it keeps that crisp cool look for hot summer days.,pos
"I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new ""go to"" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!",pos
This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!,pos
I can't say enough about this jumpsuit. within 1 hour of wearing this shopping i had 4 compliments from strangers.   it is flattering. pretty. soft. comfortable. love love love,pos
"A whim of a purchase on a tops sale. i spotted the black, but went for the mauve. it's great in person, fits loosely and hangs nicely for layering. i will buy the black too when in goes on sale. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame, and the small was perfect (and every a little roomy) on me.",pos
I love this jacket. it's easy to dress up or be casual. the black is more like a very dark grey.,pos
"Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed.  first of all, it's not a happy orange, it a darker rust.  second, it is huge.  fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top.  you could go to term in this blouse!  back it goes.  so sad.",neg
"Lovely top, very rich looking, i always get compliments. it's loose fitting but not baggy and the embroidery is well done.",pos
"I love this dress. it is so soft and comfortable, perfect for summer!! i wish it came in more colors because i would buy everyone!!",pos
"I just bought this nice dress on sale as i love the dolan brand and purchased my regular size small (34/27/35) and it fits me perfect so i'd say it runs tts. the material is nice and soft, not see through at all and a good length (i'm 5'4""). i bought the regular and didn't seem to need a petite. it's a slimming dress that's not overly tight too. i also really like the mock neck and don't find it constricting at all as the material has a bit of stretch. the short sleeves will be nice when it's sp",pos
"As other reviewers have said, this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall, just under 6 feet, and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined, but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!",pos
Even more beautiful in person. runs large as i'm usually a medium and bought a small. great for summer/fall transition.,pos
"Beautiful, flattering dress. love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing. very happy with purchase. highly recommend.",pos
"I really like this. it's not too baggy and not tight. it drapes nicely. and the pattern is a bit dainty without being frilly.
i love this blouse.",pos
"This dress is so much prettier in person! it will be great both for work and play, can't wait to pair with booties into fall.",pos
"Love this dress.fabric is very soft and flattering. i paired it with wine suede boots. great material, i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories. i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine. great go to dress!",pos
"Perfect! wanted a dress for a mexican vacation. this fits the bill exactly. fabric has enough weight to hang well and cover any ""flaws"". love!",pos
I have three pairs of these in different colors (one pair is striped) and i love them. they are flattering and comfy. they go with nearly everything. can't get enough!!!!!,pos
Runs very large. ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller,neg
"I popped into retailer the other day just to look around, and saw this dress - the fabric stood out first, then i saw the cut and style, and fell in love! they only had xs and s, and i'm usually a m because of my chest (34d) but it looked so voluminous, i thought i'd try it on. the s fit perfectly! the bodice fit a bit more closely, and the rest of the dress flowed beautifully beneath it. the sleeves are quite large, but it's kind of a fun look and feel. it's got a very ""peasant princess"" feel to",pos
This oversized coat is fabulous! i've received so many compliments on it.,pos
"This dress has a charming ""carefree"" look that invites fall.",pos
"Beautiful skort! true to size and very comfortable. the actual shorts part of the skort is a nice, modest length. they have the appearance of a skirt with the utility and feel of a nice pair of shorts. i can't wait to wear it again! i am very pleased with my purchase.",pos
"Loved this dress online, but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie.",neg
"I loved this dress after seeing it online.it is a pullover dress, and is easy to get on. my major problem with the dress is that the waist is extremely high (about 3 inches over my natural waist), and i usually have no problem with the placement of the waist in dresses. i'm going to keep the dress because i like everything else about it: the fit is flattering and the dress will be seasonless here in california. i""ll search for a wide belt to cover the waistline, or perhaps skip a belt altogether",pos
"This fits so perfect! it is light fabric, not clingy. very flattering! i am 5'4 120lbs with athletic build.",pos
"First time trying pilcro, but glad i did. these shorts are extremely soft and comfortable without being too short. love love!",pos
"Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!",neg
"Clothes generally tend to look great when you're svelte. hence thin models. i've recently put on a few pounds (normally a 4-6, xs, small in retailer, 5'6"" and i have boobs) and when i get lazy and eat a little too much i get it around the middle. i already have a chest so that makes finding clothes to look flattering harder bc the boobs create the apple effect. all that said just to make the point that this is a flattering sweater. i grabbed it last minute on the way to the dressing room, but i ne",pos
"I really like these shorts. i'm quite petite and have a hard time finding shorts to fit other than high end denim brands. these are great b/c of the sizing, i wear a 24 in most denim and the 24 in these fit perfectly. also love the length, not too short or long! going to order a second color, i have the plum and love it.",pos
"I ordered this in the peach color and it is a beautiful pale color. the underside of the cuff has a pretty pattern on it, so if you roll it up once it adds a little something extra! it is extremely see through though so you might want to wear a tank under!",pos
"I purchased the black tunic. as others have mentioned, this piece goes great with skinny jeans or leggings. when i'm rushing to find something to wear, this is one of my go-to's. nice coverage. not see-through.",pos
"Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white; however, the tee was way too big. it looked boxy and sloppy.",neg
"Fits true to size, soft material and unique look. the sleeves and overall cut of this shirt are flattering. i was worried it might look boxy or baggy but it didn't at all. the dark gray is a gorgeous color and can be dressed up or down. definitely going to be a staple in my closet.",pos
"Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out, or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality, not itchy.",pos
"I love the style, easy to wear to work or out for an evening. great quality.",pos
I wore this dress to work with a tan pair of booties and the compliments started upon entry and did not stop till the end of the day. very feminine and comfy all at once.,pos
"Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back.",neg
Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath,neg
"When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress, the stripes are diagonal. however, that is not the case with the dress in person. the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering. such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation. alas, not very flattering, so back it goes.",neg
"This sweater coat caught my attention online, so i went in search for it at my local store. it's a flattering fit, across the chest and shoulders. very well made. the length is mid thigh. i am 5'4"" 125lbs. i went with the small, with the thought of wearing nothing too bulky under it. it does have an attached belt, that can easily be knotted together or each on its own for another look, if you opt to leave it open. it's light weight enough for cool days or evenings, but also warm enough for colde",pos
"These cords are soft, comfy and my normal size 32 for tts. the length was fine for my 5'9 height. i really like the bronze color, it is almost a yellow.",pos
"Love this skirt... perfect length and cut! pilcro, make more of these!!!! i ordered up so that it hug more on my hips than waist, just prefer that better, but i think if you can pull of the waist look, go for it! would buy more in different colors!",pos
"I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine, but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering. they are scalloped at the hips, so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all.",neg
"I adore this dress. i wanted/needed to add a few velvet pieces to my wardrobe and when i saw this online i decided this had to be one of them. i'm 5'9 and ~128 pounds and ordered the x-small and it fits me perfectly. the color is so rich and the details are delicate, understated, and yet striking. i intend to wear this for a variety of occasions.",pos
This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.,pos
"I really love this top; i got the ivory and now i will probably get the black too. if you get it in your normal size (i'm almost always an xs and got this in xs), it's fitted and flattering. the seam across the sternum makes it feel like an empire top which always seems to look good on me. it is fitting in the chest and arms. it's really lightweight and has 1/2 sleeves so i will wear this even in summer.",pos
"I am not a fray fan but this dress has a modern vintage look, and it looks tailored. check out the ruffle sleeves, surprising detail. size regular small falls right above my knees, perfect at the chest (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), but the sleeves are 2 inches pass my wrist. the ruffle sleeves are too pretty to be rolled up, so i got the petite s, sleeves at perfect length, torso fits better but length is an inch shorter (thank you, cloth and stone for finally making petite sizes).",pos
This dress is adorable. dress it up or dress it down,pos
"I love this dress. it is loose fitting so be prepared for that. i ordered an xs. i believe the dress was intended to fit this way though and i do not think it looks too big on me. i typically wear a 0 or 00 in dresses. this would be a great dress to wear if you were planning on eating a big meal, ha. i can't wait to wear this dress in the summer and believe i will wear it often. it has more of a boho look to it. i do think it could be worn with heels though. i will probably wear it with flat gol",pos
"The design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc, nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix.
it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base.",neg
"Really like the quality, color, and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me, but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so, glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7"", 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans",pos
"What a pity! this blouse has a beautiful design, however it doesn't fit well on the body. it's not really a size problem, it's just not a well fitted blouse. the color is very deceptive, it looks white on the picture, but it's actually pink. i'm probably going to return it.",neg
This is a a great piece.   i tried it on in denim and went out and ordered the red checked print.  this was so cute!   i loved it in the red checked and then ordered the denim.   it can be dressed up or down.  it is comfortable and there is an edgy quality to the look.  you can wear heals and a statement necklace and it really is dressed up.  order a size down and it works well.  thank you retailer!!,pos
Love love this sweater/shirt. i have worn it out to dinner and work with leggings. it is soft and comfy. the pleats in the back are beautiful and do not require constant ironing. i even bought it in the pink.,pos
"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side.",pos
"I tried this dress on in the orange and loved it on me and felt it ran tts in my regular size small. i'm a 34d but very petite body type otherwise and didn't feel like this billowed out as much as some other reviewers described. it does have a loose feel on top which i actually like and inside there is a comfortable striped strapless top part that holds me in at the same time. i liked the feel, colors and lenth of the fabric plus i love anything with an elastic waist so i definitely plan on buyi",pos
Love this tunic...and so do others! so many compliments already!! i've worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants. it needs a cami underneath since it's sheer. i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces!,pos
As in super comfortable and a joy to wear. i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on. the moment i put it on i knew it was for me. i missed out on getting it in the other color. i hope you get more in other colors!,pos
"This looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans. i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on. longer in the back. i love the style of the sleeves. very flattering style and fun, flirty and feminine. slightly see through. depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami. a really fresh look for summer. i do not think it looks cheap. i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not",pos
A seasonal must have. nicely made. medium weight. cozy. buttons to half way down. i am petite and the xs fits with enough room for layers underneath. highly recommend.,pos
"The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage, not at my natural waist, so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up. i am busty so it's possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem. i was disappointed to return it, the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one.",neg
"I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did. i am usually a small in tops, but had read that it runs small. i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small. it is definitely a swing top. it's best feature is the detailing; it's gorgeous. i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket.",pos
"Ordered it in small regular and xtra small petite. what was surprising was that the xtra small petite fit better (meaning more room) across the chest. i'm normally a medium or medium petite, but this runs large. if you're unsure of a size, get both and return the one that doesn't fit as well. it's much better in person and looks very rich in colors and quality. the only complaint i have is there were some loose yarn pieces just dangling off the edges. i trimmed up with scissors and they didn't e",pos
"Not long ago, i bought a pair of hei hei pants that i love, so when i saw these, i immediately tried them on. i love them too. they are pretty and comfortable, and i am so happy to get away from tight jeans! they are also very flattering. size wise, i find that i have to size down with hei hei, perhaps because they have a looser cut.",pos
"I'm petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little ""holes"" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater.",neg
"I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby, so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything, i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected, but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft, comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!",pos
"This top seemed so unique online, but in person it was really nothing like the pics. super full, shorter cut. the quality wasn't what i thought it would be. i will gladly pay for nice,quality fabric and unique prints anyday... but this wasn't any of those things..",neg
"The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6"" 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok, but i felt more comfortable in the 6, and it had a really nice fit.

the quality is good, but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges, so i'm not sure how it will wear.",pos
"This top is so cute and so comfy. i love the details, especially in the back. this embodies what i love about retailer clothing- the little unique touches that you find anywhere else. very pleased.",pos
"These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5""). i can go between a 4 and a 6, and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said, the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff, and the sheen made them feel cheap, unfortunately.",neg
"This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately, i caught the cutouts a few times, and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable, but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan, this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s",pos
"I ordered the pink and it is the slightest hint of pink mixed with ivory. it fits true to size. the detailing of the crochet is outstanding. it reminds me of seashells that my daughter & i collected last year when we visited san diego. i wish the teal green one would be in stock in xl. i would grab it up. it's not the softest knit, but it's very comfortable to wear all day. very pretty version of a cardigan.",pos
"I was so happy to see this dress at one of my local retailer stores since i've had this in my basket since i first saw it, i tried it on in my usual size and it runs true to size in all areas. the length is as shown int he picture, i am 5'4"" and it hit me right above the knee. i am short waisted and the dress fit perfect, sat right above my waist and then lay just as shown. not too much material to make you look fuller in the hips, and also not too young looking. i am planning to wear it to",pos
"The quality and aesthetic of this dress is wonderful. the fit and look are classic. i am 5'10'' and the dress falls mid thigh. this is a beautiful dress for a special event, simple but with sparkle at the neckline and an unusual print. i am very happy with this purchase.",pos
"This runs very short. i had to size up so i could wear as a dress. still too short to wear to work with a cardi but adorable to wear to daytime summer events and date nights with hubby. i am 5'6"". length may work better for shorter women. love the style and fabric. very feminine, float and easy to wear with sandals on a hot summer day.",pos
"The dress is well-structured and refined enough to wear with a cardigan to work on casual fridays but fun enough to wear on its own to a summer festival. because of the length, i would suggest wearing with heels, as it hits below the knee. i would suggest a size down, especially if you are smaller-busted.",pos
"This sweater dress is very beautiful in person. the colors are very ""fall"", i actually decided against it only because i felt it was too busy for my personality. as for the fit, it runs fairly true to size, maybe slightly small. i tried on my usual medium, but i think i would have sized up for a more relaxed look. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a size 6. this could be quite a stunning piece on the right person!",pos
This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one?,pos
"Fun outerwear for the fall. the color is a bit more grey than the photo shows (at least on my screen), but i still think it'll go with a lot.",pos
"This is comfy and casual and fun to wear.  moss ombrã© is darker and less ombrã© than pictured, so i wish i had gotten the other color way instead.  i can see myself wearing this for running errands, grabbing take-out and other important things like hanging out on my couch.  definitely size down or this will look too wide & boxy.",pos
"This dress is a winner, i'm baffled that there is only one review? i thought this was a dolan dress. the material is soft and substantial. the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk. this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations. i'm 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35 and purchased size m.",pos
I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online. the material is extremely soft & comfortable ( not at all itchy). tts. i fell in love with it immediately and can't believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work ( with some skinny ankle length pants). can be dressed up or down. this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall,pos
"These pants are elegant and chic. great for tall women. wearing to a yacht cruise, can't wait! would have loved to wait for the sale, but i had to have them and i am very pleased.",pos
"Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft. but, they didn't finish the bottom hem! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem, but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself. because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays. the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesn't make sense. also, while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest, almost like a water mark. just overall bad attent",neg
"A romantic find. light and airy. the color is slightly darker than shown. the soft, subtle ruffles give it just the right touch.",pos
"Beautiful skirt with a fun, graphic pattern and embroidered texture. i tried on my usual xs as well as a s to compare. they both fit but i decided to keep the xs since the skirt has a little bit of a stretch thanks to a hidden elastic panel in the back, plus it looks best at your natural waist. i'm 5'2"" and often need to wear petite, but this skirt is already quite short so i bought the regular size. looks great bare-legged or with tights. love the pockets too!",pos
"I really wasn't sure if this dress would work for me, so i was very excited when i fell in love with it! i haven't experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted, thank goodness! i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress. i have worn it with tights, a belt and short-heeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy. but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings, wearing it more tunic style. the slip underneath is a great feature as well! it does",pos
"This dress is adorable. the material is thin and wrinkles easily but it is so flattering. the cut is a little flowy like typical off-the-shoulder dresses but this one is cut in at the waist so your figure is not swallowed up. it combines the sexy summer vibe of an off-the-shoulder look but flatters like a fit and flare dress. it is fairly short. while i am only 5'4"" in an xs it falls just a bit further up on my legs than the model pictured (makes no sense to me). the color is a rich coral pink a",pos
"After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!",pos
"These pants fit the bill! they're soft and very comfortable. easy to wear day and night. these are a little higher on the waist, which i love. purchased two pair! i purchased the regular and they come to my ankles.",pos
"I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...

i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on",pos
For those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50% lambswool and 50% acrylic. the original version of this coat was 100% lambswool. 50% acrylic yet the price remained the same???i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100% lambswool like the original version. this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials.,neg
"I love this blouse! i get so many compliments when i wear it. i can't wait for warmer weather to pair it with my coral short skirt from retailer. currently, i wear it with a pair of slim cream colored pants, and flats. it works great! it is a little on the short side, but it just adds to the tailored look of the cut. however, if you're taller than 5'5"" or 5'6"", i would expect it to be much shorter on you (you've been warned ;)
overall, this is a great addition to your wardrobe, and it washes nicel",pos
"I ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be. they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather. the printed fabric is really pretty.

sadly, they seem to run on the large size. i wear size 14 pants, but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist. i am sending them back and getting the smaller size.",pos
"Great for hot weather, dress up and dress down! don't need to decide what to match with and bottom or top!",pos
"Nice to have colors rather than a solid top. i actually bought the pink also because i like the fit so much. i'm 5'8"", 140 and wear a size 6, tts. i like the cut and it's long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me.",pos
"After the second wash, the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart. after sewing it back up, wearing it, and washing it a third time, the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well. not sure if this was just a fluke, but it was very disappointing. now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact, i must say that this is a great dress. i would have returned the dress to retailer, but i've already washed and worn it, so again...very disappointing. i would say",neg

"I'm 5'10"" and have athletic legs. these jeans are so comfy, long enough, and look good on the booty. the photo is deceiving as they are much longer. i wish they carried more colors. it's hard to find a jean i really like and i really like these.",pos
Love the fabric. comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress. good for those cool fall mornings.,pos
"I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size.

The print caught my eye. then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on. i am only 5'2'' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well.. this dress fit me perfectly! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments. this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny.,pos
I absolutely love this sweater. it is a beautiful deep blue color. i love the unique cuff on the sleeves.. i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically. looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it!,pos
"This ia a great casual top...the design flaws mentioned in previous reviews are what gives it a trendier look...the length is perfect but i needed to size down from a large to medium because the fit was a bit loose on the body and arm...would like to add that while it is good quality it's still somewhat overpriced for a t -shirt material top, lace accent..",pos

The raspberry color is really stunning! i have been looking for colored tights for a while and had difficulty finding really rich colors. i was thrilled when i saw these! i've worn them once so far. very comfortable and seem like they will last.,pos
"This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon, soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though",pos
"I was hesitent to order this, was worried it would be too shapeless. i'm glad i ordered it as it is light and flowy though not so much that it makes you look like a shapeless tent. the colors are vibrant and the smooth fabric feels good against your skin. it is lined. i had no issues with the bust (i'm 38c). i wish it were an inch longer (i'm 5'9).",pos
"This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me, i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8"" and a size medium or 10.",pos
"Don't be put off by the sparkle! this jacket is amazing. lovely detail with the print on print with the sequined patches. i love this retailer in house brand, elevenses. i take a medium in this brand( 8/10) and the medium fits full with room like a bomber style would offer. i had tried a small in my local store and it was not a small -small so if you want a tighter fit then go for a small. but i like thinks to have a more fluid feel. i have a 34 dd chest as reference. i plan to wear this in spring",pos
I bought this shirt in blue (because the store was out of gray and i had to have it right then) and it is my favorite. it is comfortable and durable. i also appreciate the length of the shirt. it is long enough for me to not worry about putting my arms up. it is an overall great buy. i want one in every color.,pos
"I tried this in the store a few weeks ago when it just came out because i loved the neutral design and look of it and came back the following week to purchase it with my discount code because it really is worth it...
_______
pros:
- true a-line silhouette. if you have curves and hips like i do (5'9, 36c, hourglass, 165 lbs), then this skirt will flatter you completely. there's a lovely swing to the dress and it drapes wonderfully because it's a thicker fabric.
- runs tts. i can normally wear",pos
"This sweater vest is the best! it is so versatile! i've already worn it over a dress and recieved compliments all day. the knit is substantial without being to thin or heavy. i love the little flecks of color in the yarn as well! it makes coordinating easy. i thought the faux fur might be too overwhelming or hot, but thankfully it's not at all. runs true to size. worth full price!",pos
"I tried this sweater on in the store, regretted not purchasing it, and ended up buying it online. the fabric is soft, seems to be good quality, and hangs nicely. i purchased the taupe color and it is a rich, pretty color.",pos
I love this jacket and can't get enough of it. it has side pockets as well as the buttoned-pockets. i love the cinched waist option for a more fitted look.,pos
"This blouse was so cute, i really wanted to love it. as others mentioned, there is something wrong with the fit. i'm not a large person, but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small.",neg
"I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said, i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck, but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o",pos
"So happy i purchased this - it's a gorgeous piece, and perfect for fall and winter. the colors are soft and beautiful, and i feel like this will pair well with a lot of shirts in my closet.",pos
"These socks were so narrow, especially on top, that they pinched my thighs and we're almost painful to wear all day. my thighs are pretty narrow, i'm only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body. i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they don't slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny. ""one size"" is definitely not true. they also snag easily.",neg
"I always look for things to hide ""parts"" without making my ""parts"" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn't notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top.",pos
"I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details , but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out, but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope",neg
"This top! i was hesitant to try this on because it felt too busy, however it is a must have. it's just the right amount of lace and detail. i am typically an m in retailer tops (sometimes l depending on the designer; i'm a 32/34ddd). i initially tried a l in this thinking it had no stretch but ended up going with the medium. the arms were a tad tight but stretched slightly after an hour of wear and it fits perfectly everywhere. i think if you size up it will be too ""blousy."" highly recommend this-",pos
"This dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer. i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric. also, you can't beat the price for an retailer dress!",pos
"I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.",neg
"The material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky. i think this dress is true-to-size, or maybe runs a little bit big, but only by a little bit. i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants. the dress hugs nicely on the upper body (arms, chest, ribs) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area. it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps. the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha",pos
"Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i don't have an occasion to wear this).

length is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.

color is very nice, overall sexy dress.

material is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-)",pos
"This is one of the softest blouses i now own. it feels and wears like a premium blouse. i love it, and it actually makes my backside look smaller too. even though it is flowy, it is true to size. if you have small arms and a chest than you could go down a size. this is one of my new favorite purchases, and i wear it with the cabled knit bomber and boots.",pos
"Fabulous with leggings. i am 5'1"", 105 lbs and always wear pxs. the pxs was too large and fit like a ps, so order a size down. i really like it, and going to exchange for a smaller size.",pos
"I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the",neg
"This sweater is flattering, fun, and practical. i wear to work and out at night to dressier functions. i bought both the green and black. both are cute on and super soft.",pos
"This is the most perfect tunic out there. it is comfy, flattering and fits perfect. it can be dressed up or dressed down. definitely worth it to buy in every color!",pos
"I love this top. lovely, light, airy material, though i don't think i'll wear a cami under it. i'm usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small. i love the way it fits.",pos
"Is it possible to be in love with a dress? i think so and i am. when i put this dress on it literally took my breath away. it is beautiful and very well-made. this dress is so fun! i wore it to an event this past weekend and received more compliments than i ever have on something i'm wearing. this beauty is so incredibly comfortable and bonus - it has pockets! i am a petite 4 and it runs very true to size for me. in the store, it looked more navy than black, but as i have it home, it is definite",pos
"What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front. the shirt was folded at the store, which makes sense because if it were hung it up, fewer people would try it on. this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back. this is what bugs me about so many ""clothes"" that are made these days: they are so cheaply made, so thin with cloth, that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public. i can't wear sheer clothes",neg
The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me. maybe would've been better for someone with a smaller bust. the quality of the fabric was just okay.,neg
I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.,pos
"Great everyday dress. i bought a small (5'9, 135lbs) and it really fits nicely.",pos
"Love this zip cardigan with removable faux fur. it did not look like much on the hanger but once on it is soft , rich and just adorable, it can be dressed up or down, perfect for a finishing piece over a dress to wearing with jeans and skirts. the fabric is soft but substantial . the only negative for me is the zipper sticks a little. a plus it is a ivory shade and is a good basic. i chose my typical medium and fits perfect . 34 dd chest for reference. sale price plus promo made this a winner. i",pos
"In love! just wow. beautiful colors although they're dark you can still see all the variations. the flannel is light and not too heavy. there's visible black lace just below the shoulder. pretty buttons. ordered the large, my normal size and it's a perfect fit. roomy but not oversized. so well made i think this will be a favorite for years.",pos
I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model. i forget that the models are almost 6 feet tall. this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders. it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one. lovely material but not at all figure flattering.,neg
"It is a beautiful shirt and fits perfectly. i purchased it in ivory and although not a true ivory, it has some pinkish tones to it, it is absolutely beautiful. looks perfect with a long necklace and jeans.",pos
"After having my third child, i was looking for clothes to hide my tummy. i've always loved the comfort of a romper, but the typical cinched waist was never flattering on me. this romper does not disappoint. it hides areas i want hidden, but does so with style. i get numerous compliments whenever i wear this. i cannot say enough wonderful things about this piece!",pos
"This is a wow! so chic...reminds of something i would have bought in paris. worth every penny. even my husband loves it on me...his words were ""it's a standout"". i work in the design industry so i am always looking for something that represents what i do...nailed it!",pos
"This romper is cute, well-made and true to size, but i haven't figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties. which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on. not sure what the designers were thinking here. i'm returning this one.",neg
"I'm a short girl, but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer. for me, i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered. this shirt is adorable. love the details. i wanted it so bad, which is why i paid so much for a basic t-shirt. still, it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or v-neck to break up the dots.",neg
This dress has a great shape and fabric - but the v neckline is too deep/low and the arm holes are also cut too low. would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return.,neg
"This dress is probably the most comfortable dress i've ever had! the fabric is very comfortable and breathable, and it flatters my straight body type.",pos
"$20 for super comfy, warm leggings. bought two pairs for myself and another pair for my mother. let's be honest, i'll probably be buying another pair.",pos
This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well. i did not find it to be well made. the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places. i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay. putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach. for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering.,neg
"I love this top and wear it all the time. it's a gorgeous pale blue and feels amazing....it is a tighter fitting shirt so if you like looser clothes, size up",pos
"This dress is huge. also, i was super disappointed in the fabric. i thought it would be silly like a georgette. but it was coarse, more like a poplin, and thin. i thought it looked cheap.",neg
This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.,pos
"I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo, so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person, the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate",pos
"I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.

still looking for the perfect dress...",neg
"I love this dress ! my husband loves this dress on me !
i ordered on line, it did not come in my usual 4, and it was only in petite. i ordered the 0petite. it fits fine, a little shorter than expected, but i am 5'2"" so it is fine.
very well made and lined.",pos
This is an amazing looking skirt. it has such an exciting pattern on it and is very flattering. it is very light weight though....almost flimsy. but...it is not a deal breaker. i wear it and love it!,pos
"My hips are very narrow and i don't have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual. 

 i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size 8. it's very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things.",pos
Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs),pos
"This dress in a lovely platinum is feminine and fits perfectly, easy to wear and comfy, too! highly recommend!",pos
"I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful! i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store. there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath. the only reason i rated it as ""runs small"" is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most. i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath. the sleeves are long but can be rolled",pos
"It's a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue; however, the lace on the hemlines were snagged.  the top was much shorter than i had anticipated.  i'm returning it to the store, unfortunately.",neg

"This is classic retailer at it's best.  quality   style   a little something extra makes this piece something that will likely live in my fall / winter wardrobe for decades to come.  first the quality is superb, soft gray wool with a delicate floral embroidery motif on the front. military buttons down the front with a fit and flare waist on a 3/4 length coat.  versatile enough to wear as a sweater or light coat for early fall. fit is generous enough to easily fit a bulky sweater underneath and lay",pos
"This dress is my new favorite! the style is trendy and feminine while forgiving in the tummy area without looking maternity or too baggy. it is so versatile because it can be dressed up or down and it's a great transitional dress b/c once it cools down, it will look great with a denim jacket, cardi, booties, etc. i normally wear a m, sometimes a l (i'm 5'7"", 36dd) but the m fits great. the slip is a little snug across the chest but i definitely couldn't size up b/c then the dress would be too bi",pos
The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. can't wear this again.,neg
I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe..,pos
Love these jeans for summer! i followed the advice of previous reviewers and sized down to a 26. after wearing these for a few hours they stretched a little and fit great!! they look sweet with the palo alto blouse and the embroidered edessa top. highly recommend!,pos
"I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy, but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide, just awful.",neg
"This ""little"" dress is extremely cute and very comfortable. i didn't pay enough attention to the picture and totally missed the faux wrap skirt, but that only adds to the appeal, and is well done, not showing too much skin. this dress looks great with a white denim jacket or a red cardi. it will get lots of use and really is a 3 quarters of the year piece.",pos
This is definitely true to size. i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight( this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt) the medium was spot on. not too tight and not too baggy. i think it's a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties. it looks like denim too which i wasn't expecting. way better in person!,pos
"This top is just as pretty in person as it is online. i usually buy petites, but ordered this one in the regular length and i'm glad i did. perfect on me at 5'2"". my usual size medium fit great everywhere else too. love their fabric choice as well. i'm getting really tired of the thin cottons and slub jersey materials being used so often now. deletta made my day once again!!!",pos
"In the fall and winter, i live in my uniform of skinny jeans, boots and a long sweater. this cardigan will be perfect! the fabric is very nice quality and the colors are gorgeous. i can see myself wearing it over and over!",pos
"Love this shirt, great fabric and fit. trying to wait for a sale to buy several others in additional colors.",pos
"I got one of these tanks, and went back and bought two more online. i have the gray, green and white. the white requires a undershirt for me, but that's no problem. the shirts are darling, they're under activewear and i think they could be used that way, but i definitely don't. they're simple but have a nice flow, and the front and back are perfect. i love the material and the colors. i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones, i don't love bright colors but i love the green, white",pos
"I ordered this dress online and i love it! i'm only 5'2"" so it's always a challenge for me with maxis but this one fit the bill. not too much fabric to be overwhelming on a shorter frame and the length was perfect. the fabric is very comfortable and moves with you. also the quality is great! i ordered a small petite but i probably could have gone xs petite. this would dress would be flattering on most people. need same dress, more colors!",pos
"This is such a cute top. i bought it when it was a new arrival and couldn't be more thrilled. it washes well in the the washing machine. the only flaw is that it runs on the short side. otherwise, i'm thrilled.",pos
"I purchased both colors offered and love this light weight full of neat detail piece to layer with other tops. the material is very soft and stretchy making it easy to wear over another item. i love the little shirt tail detail in back along with the drawstring trim in front. another piece that i am sure i will wear for years to come and the fit is true to size.

"I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.",neg

"It jacket of the season! this bomber is absolutely perfect. not only is the embroidery beautiful, but it's super comfy as well. it's lightweight, nicely lined, and well made. i only gave it four stars for quality simply because the embroidery could get pulled and frayed if not careful. you should expect that with any silky embroidered fabric however.  i would highly recommend this jacket for any body type.",pos
"I love this sweater dress. i got the ivory color in a size small. i'm a size 6 & 5'5"". i feel in love with it while shopping with a friend, who kind of rolled her eyes at it. i went back later because i knew i loved it. since the ones on the sale rack were covered with dust and dirt at the hem. i ordered it on line in m & small and the small fit better. it is so soft, and the color is great.",pos

"I wasn't sure how clingy this dress might be or how it would look on my ""curvy"" body. it's actually really lovely. it runs large but not overwhelming. nice length; above the knee in the front, slightly longer in the back. the colors are really beautiful (i got the darker color). will definitely wear this with a belt, otherwise i think (as other reviewers said) it will be too maternity-looking. i got this at a great sale price!",pos
You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but it's huge! the colors were also a bit grayish which i didn't expect.,neg

"This top is lovely; great colors for spring, light material, flow-y, and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a 2 (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 32 c/d depending on the brand), so larger chested women may want to size up, but it's well worth it",pos
This suit is great for curvy and slightly flawed figures. the vintage look delivers full coverage that still looks sexy. not your mother's one-piece.,pos
"Bought this dress for engagement photos and was a little worried about sizing, but when i got it it fit perfectly and was very comfortable. it runs true to size. my only complaint is that there was a missing button on the sleeve, but because there was an extra it was easily fixed. definitely recommend!",pos
"This top is perfect for wanting that fall/winter look in warmer climates. the slits on the sides allow for a lot of movement and turtleneck is just right. i love wearing it with my paige bell canyon flairs and some clogs! my only thing i wish was that it was cut in so much at the top, as how you can see at the model's armpit, wish that part was a little wider it would be a bit more flattering. otherwise great top, i have it in black and been thinking about getting it in the orange color too!",pos
I just bought this shirt on sale. i'd been eyeing it for a bit and when it went on sale i had to get it. its really cute and comfortable and fits really nicely. it's not too short or boxy and the detail on the sleeves is great.,pos
I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you,neg

"These shorts are great, both the design and fit are beautiful. i would say that these run true to size, i bought my usual size, 26, and they fit perfectly. they fit a little high waisted, which i love. the material is so soft and are so comfortable. i would recommend these shorts if you're thinking about it!",pos
I needed a pink dress for a local breast cancer awareness luncheon. this is a perfect fit for the occasion!,pos
"I ordered this online with fingers crossed, in my usual size m. it fits well, albeit a tad snug (although very flattering on my curvy frame). it is an unusual color for me, but i ended up loving it in person where you can really appreciate all the detailed woven patterns in the fabric. there is a slip underneath which ends several inches above the hem.",pos
Worth every penny. i sized down one size and they look amazing.,pos
I love the fit and feel of this shirt. the fit is narrow but true to size. the stitching details are beautiful and make this shirt really versatile.,pos
"I have been dreaming of the perfect overall that i can live in this spring/summer. these overalls completely fit the bill. i would normally wear a size 24, but i wanted the fit to be more relaxed with a slight slouchy look. i went with a a size 25 and they are exactly what i wanted. i feel like i can move around feely in these. they are extremely comfortable and the denim is pretty lightweight. i highly recommend these!",pos
This tunic is super comfy and will look great with leggings or skinny jeans. i absolutely love the detailing on the sleeves. i am so glad i ordered this item!,pos
"Flattering cut, perfect for work or play. even better yet, it was on sale! if they had it in other colors i would buy it! beautiful high-quality garment like all the others i have purchased at retailer!!!",pos
This product was offered in a pink color which compliments many color palettes. perfect for layering.,pos
"I just adore these shorts from art dept. they are casual, yet slightly structured. the length is just perfect (for me), no ride up, no wrinkles (i can't stand wrinkled shorts), and the fringe gives these shorts a fun and playful look just perfect for a stroll on the beach or shopping with your girlfriends. i know these shorts are going to be a staple in my summer wardrobe for years. can i have these in more colors and patterns too????",pos
"These are very soft and fit well. at first i was a bit put off on the stone wash of the fabric; each pair is different. but it adds character and given the color and the soft fabric, it's a nice difference. i love the pockets, they are deep enough for anything you want to put into them. i love good deep pockets and my cell fits nice into my back pocket. take notice makers of woman's pants, there are some of us who *like* deep pockets!

only one negative... i have noticed hei-hei is not sewing",pos
Highly recommend this top. received lots of compliments on the day that i wore. recommend wearing with a tank top.,pos
Too small... too flare... nice thick fabric. not my favorite pant.,neg
"Easy, fun and flattering. fits tts. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i ordered a large and it fits well. the tie at the back lets you wear it as tight or loose as you want it. the length is good for my 5'9 frame.",pos
"I bought the multi-color stripe and it is adorable! i am 5'9"", 135 lbs and purchased a size small. it is a perfect length and drapes well...not too tight at all. i received a ton of compliments the first time i wore it. highly recommend!",pos
"These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a",pos
"This is the softest, most perfectly cut basic. love the black, wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered. as usual with retailer basics, i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso.",pos
"This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.",pos
This is a 3-season item that can function as a cardigan or a jacket and will look equally good with jeans or with work slacks. the seaming gives it a bit of structure. the asymmetrical zipper gives it a little twist. the texture gives it interest. i bought it in navy and i'm considering the ivory.,pos
"Love this top. bought it in black and first day i wore it to a party and i think everyone gave me a compliment! it is very flattering to my shape. have a bit of a pooch, and can't even tell. looks great with skinny jeans. look forward to wearing many more times",pos
"I took a risk and bought this blouse and got a wonderful surprise. i bought my usual size small (34c, 31"" waist) and it was perfect. the details of this blouse are amazing. you cannot see the flecks of copper-gold leaves all over the fabric or the gold threads running down the seam in the front. it is really, really beautiful. the fabric overall is soft and flowy and the sleeves do not stand out off my shoulders in a weird way. there is a soft flow of ruffle down both sides of the shirt. the fro",pos
"I saw this shirt online, loved it, but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small. however, retailer shirts tend to be long on me, so i ordered a petite small. it fits great! i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long. the shirt comes to my hips. for reference i'm 5'8"" 145 lbs. and my measurements are 34-27-38.",pos
"Very happy i purchased this jacket - although to me it is really a coat. it fits wonderfully and is so soft. i appreciate the uniqueness - not the usual dull winter shades of black/gray/navy. although i live in minneapolis much of the winter & it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond 20 degrees, it is perfect for the in-between 21- 50 degree days. i am a size 6 (5'5"", 135 lbs). tried the small & medium. the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right.",pos
"I love this dress - originally ordered the medium, which is my normal size, especially because i am tall. the arm holes were gaping, and so i returned for the small. the small is perfect. it fits exactly as on the model, and i didn't have a problem with the color being see-through. it really is so unique but so simple. the color is perfect. 

i took a single star off because it is not lined - for the price, this would have been nice.",pos
Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.,pos
"Saw these in store and had to have them. online pictures do not do them justice. great pattern, fabric and features. can be dressed up or down. sizing is accurate--i am 5' 4"" and 117 lbs and bought an xs. they fit perfectly. wish they had more colors/patterns to purchase.",pos
My title says it all. this coat is sure to turn heads everywhere you go. the colors in the coat are beautiful jewel tones and differnt then you will see anywhere. it is so soft and warm and makes me feel fabulous. i feel it fits tts i am short and the regular lent was fine on me. get this before it's gone.,pos
"The overall styling was great, and the dress is super-cute, if a little thick (it's made of denim, after all). i ordered a size down from my normal, and even then, i was swimming in it. the worst part, and the aspect that will make me return it, is that the arm holes hang down so low that i'd have to wear a tank top under the dress. i'm returning it, though it is really cute and i love this brand. the arm holes killed it for me.",neg
"I debated buying this, so glad i did. tts. i'm 5'5"" 115 and 32c. i got size 2, and it worked but i could have done a 0 (which is my usual size). i was afraid to order it too small because i needed it right away! this dress is gorgeous! i got the pink color way and it is more vibrant in person. the beading is beautiful, it's incredibly soft and flowy! this dress is probably my favorite dress ever! if you're on the fence, order it!",pos
The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,neg
"If you are on the shorter side, do with the petite size. i ordered both (at first, petite was sold out) so glad i got to get it. i looked lost in the regular size, the back length was well below my bum. both colors are really nice, but i did end up with the orange one, more ""dressy"", red one looked more calsual (though it is a casual shiryt, i had on trousers, and hte orange looked nice with them).",pos
"I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me. the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure, but it at least fit well. the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others. i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me. i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short.",neg
"Tried this is my normal 4, and it fits exactly as shown. i can see how this could give issues to someone with any curves because the lining is definitely more fitted than the loose overlay, especially in the bust and hips. i found the quality to be very nice, length was slightly above the knee on my 5'7"" frame so it feels work-appropriate. my only wish is that the colors/pattern could transition better to multiple seasons. it definitely feels very springy and not much else.",pos
"Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me. i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes, sadly i sent it back.",neg
"Great jacket for night time in the south this time of year ... very nice fabric, great classic style with a little twist... love retailerplogy ... being an older female, sometimes things can look boring ....i love to dress in fun clothes ... finding something that will work for all ages and that is a ""little out side the lines "" is very nice!!!!",pos
I love this sweater! it does run a little large though. fits beautifully. great for cool summer nights and early fall. dress up or down.,pos
I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small. can't review anything else because i couldn't even get them on.... ridiculous,neg
Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.,pos
"This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality.. 
it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully.
i cant wait to wear it this summer.",pos
The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.,neg
"I've had this dress for a while now and waited to write a review, glad i did. i originally ordered the mp, 5'5"" 130 lbs. while it looked nice - accentuated my waist it was a bit big in the chest area. it probably would have been ok but i am picky about fit. after debating for awhile i ordered the sp and it fits much better! when i pulled it out of the package i was worried it was too short but it's not. it hits right above my knee. in fact i compared both dresses and there is not much of a diffe",pos
"I loved this dress. i'm 5'6"" and wore the small and even in heels it was a bit long. i have a larger chest (double d) and the chest was slightly snug but otherwise fit perfectly.  i got compliments from everyone, gorgeous dress.",pos
"These are my saucy, fun jeans.  when the ps brought them over, i wasn't sure about them but at 5'3, they make the perfect ankle jean.  they look great with boots and are so comfy!  i typically wear a 26-27 but i sized down in these because they're a lower fit on me and i wanted the waist to be tight.  as the darling fiance says, they make your derriere look ""great!""  i'd snag these on sale ;)",pos
"This is a great little top. a wonderful basic, but the crochet/lace detail adds the perfect amount of uniqueness. it's a soft jersey material that doesn't cling. falls very nicely over the body, flow-y without being too flow-y. i ordered my usual small, and it fits tts. for reference i'm 5'1, 125 lbs, and 34d bust. i did not order the petite since i have a longer torso, very happy i orderer a regular small. will be a great spring and summer top.",pos
"I bought navy in my usual size s, and the color and fit are exactly as pictured. very good quality cotton. the pocket can lay funny on the hips but a little adjustments does the trick. i wore this chemise at home and hubby noticed it (never happens), i wore it to study in coffee shop with boots and scarf and felt comfortable, warm and stylish. great staple, well made and well priced.",pos
"I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it, it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!",pos
"Beautiful dress! it looks fresh, feminine and the quality of the fabric is very nice.",pos
"A beautiful, comfortable dress with it's own unique style. a must to add to your wardrobe",pos
"The colors are so pretty, a pinkish brown and a light brown trim. it is very soft and elegant looking. great with jeans or leggings. the tie is a little high in back but looks great. highly recommend!",pos
"I had the seafolly garden suit last year (same cut) and loved it. i decided the light blue color didn't look great on me so i decided to get this one. i found that the garden suit was cut smaller than this umbrella print one. right now i'm a 10 m and got the 12 in this, just like last time. i probably could've gotten the 10 but i'll keep the 12 for comfort. note: the leg holes are not tight and do not make upper thighs/butt squish out like you might imagine. try this suit!",pos
"I found this at my retailer store--the only dress left. i bought this in black in my usual size small (4-6). this dress was so pretty on and fabulous in hot weather. the material is gauzy and so the look is casual. i'm not sure i would wear it in the evening but the fit was great. i am tall, (5' 9"") and the dress is long enough for me. i would say it is the same length as on the model. it is a bit pricey for what it is but i bought it as a birthday gift to myself.",pos
"What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i'm not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars!",pos
"I love this dress so much - the perfect summer dress. comfortable, easy to travel with and i get compliments on it all the time!",pos
If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade,neg
"I so wanted to love this top. i ordered the ""blue"", which is blue and orange. i thought the orange would be brighter, it is not. it is a dull color. also, i'm usually a medium, this top fits fine on my shoulders/bust 34c, but it was huge around the waist, making me look a lot larger. if this top were a bit smaller around the waist, i would keep it, but it is going back.",neg
"I was a little nervous to purchase this top as there were no previous reviews. but it intrigued me- especially with the sale price! i love it! i am 5' 6"" and got the small. it hits just at/below my knee in the front and a few inches above my ankle in the back. it is perfect with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings. what makes it go from a frumpy tunic to a cute flowy top is the slits up the side. a beautiful touch! the neck is very high- almost a cross between a turtle neck and a hooded look. i l",pos
"I admit i have a soft spot for a most anything from maeve. this dress is no exception. i had overlooked it online due to the white shirt they show with it online. but the material, design tex are great. the colors are very me and i can see this being a great fall, winter and early spring dress. the material is very soft ( i have sensitive skin) and i love the little pop of color that the front piece adds. the only draw back for me is the lack of pockets and it runs big. i got this on sale so siz",pos
"I love the design and color of this jacket. when i saw it pictured, i thought it was a vest. the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric; the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacket.
i ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer. 
this jacket runs smaller, the sleeves were very tight , and overall it was just too small. had to return it.",pos
"This is my fourth amadi piece from retailer.  i love their signature fitted crossover top design which i am finding in many of their pieces (like the lola jumpsuit, crossfront lola dress and others).  this dress has the same crossover top design, with a slim maxi silhouette.    the fabric is 97% rayon and 3% nylon with a neat texture that doesn't come through on the product photo but adds to its appeal in my opinion because it hides wrinkles.  it fits tts and the same as the other amadi pie",pos
"I love these jeans! they actually look better than the picture and you cannot beat the sale price. they are a boyfriend fit, but you can order your normal size. usually with boyfriends, i have to order one to two sizes down. with skinnies and more fitted jeans, i am a 29 and that's what i got. there is no sagging or stretching out after wearing them for a while. the wash is absolutely beautiful...very worn. hopefully the holes in the knees won't get even bigger. i have worn and washed them now q",pos
Love this dress! accents your curves and slims you waist!,pos
I am not a one-piece body type. this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on!! i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the 1)perfect length of shorts 2) drapey fabric (not clingy) 3) asymmetrical cut of the top. highly recommend!,pos
"This tank is perfect. it fits close to the body, but does not squeeze. it is super soft, smooth, and comfy. it layers perfectly under blouses. this is by far my favorite basic tank!",pos
I love the fit of the peplum top. it's flattering without being too full on the bottom. the print is lovely and great for summer and spring!,pos
"I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d, and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality, and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper.",pos
"This dress is amazing! love the fit, quality and design. so unique and is perfect for dressing up or down. wore it to a wedding and plan on wearing it to work. also, i'm a tall girl (5' 11"") and this dress was such a good length for me. no one likes a dress that's too short. i ordered a size 8 and it fit perfectly around the waist and chest.",pos
"I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?",neg
"I love an item of clothing that i am able to justify its purchase by knowing it is unlike any other piece in my closet. this skirt definitely fits that desire.the material looks almost like the colors were ""felted"" onto the dark background creating a wearable art piece! very vibrant colors. the material itself is somewhat stiff and maintains its structure when on. i needed to wear a size 6 (i'm sometimes a 4; sometimes a 6 with a waist measurement of 28"") and the skirt sits at the smallest part",pos
I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning,neg
"I love this blouse. it's a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine. to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as it's a bit sheer. and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately, but is still functional. the decorative part fell off. they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters i'll sew that one on.

i absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is. i didn't realize it was dry clean only but that doesn't bother me.",pos
Perfect fit! can be dressed up or down! more colors please!,pos
"Definitely a curve hugger. i bought the summer version of this dress (sleeveless white with black stripes) earlier this year and it was my go to dress all season long. was very excited to see a fall/winter version to pair with tights and boots. bought a medium again and it fits great. this is a very flattering dress, and the material is lightweight yet substantial and forgiving of flaws.",pos
"This sweater is beautiful! not only is the lace front gorgeous, but it is incredibly comfortable and so well crafted. definitely my favorite cardigan now.",pos
This jacket has cute details. i like the front pockets and color. it has no shape and is about 1 size bigger than marked. i felt like a sack of potatoes in it.,neg
"I really fell in love with this shirt. i am about 5 4 and 110 pounds. i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide, i was ready to fly. although the model wears this shirt really nicely, i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body. not quite sure what that is.... also this shirt is shorter than what i expected. it looks a lot longer on the model. i had to return this shirt.",neg
"I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan, and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.",pos
Sweater fits great and is nice and soft. i am 5'11 and got a m and the arms and length are perfect for me,pos
"Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8"".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.",pos
I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldn't lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures. when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store.,neg
"Fits like a dream. i have a thick middle and tend to have problems with anything that flairs out, so i was so happy that it hung beautifully on me. even though i wasn't really looking for a sweater to take on a trip to europe in a few weeks, i bought it on the spot. i bought it in neutral which is the only color the store had and after seeing the darker color am happy with it. i love the belt since most sweaters don't have anything to close them and the belt lays perfectly as well.",pos
I love this shirt! it was a great price and very high quality. it has different material stitched in the inside,pos
"The stone color was nice, but the material is heavy and doesn't breath. if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item. upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last.",neg
This is awesome multi-season dress.,pos
"Beautiful jacket for a light day. fits a little large., so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look, order down a size.",pos
"I love flowy pants like these. pattern looks different, the green is pale, like on the far right. smocking is a beautiful touch and they are a nice weight and well made. had to hem them up about 2"" and i'm 5'8"", about 180. xl fits perfectly.",pos
"Absolutely love this dress! i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline, but flipped it around for an evening night out. can't recommend it enough - two of my colleagues ordered it that day.",pos
"This top is very cute. it is a high low top that i wasn't expecting, but love it. the picture doesn't do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model. fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small. got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus. will get a lot of wear out of this top.",pos
Soft fabric and hangs nicely. washes well. purchased in the orange /red and love with jeans.,pos
Got the mustard and grey. very cute. looking forward to wearing it,pos
"I did not notice this dress on the website. it was not until i saw it in store (was an online purchase & returned) - i was immediately in love. i love the color, texture and rosettes. i feel like a million bucks wearing it and have received so many compliments on it. before buying it, i actually ran home to gather a previous purchase and return it so i could buy this dress and not feel guilty! i am usually a 2 or 4 and the 6 fits perfect through and through. so happy with this lovely dress!",pos
"For anyone who loves lace. it fits pretty true to size. the size m length hits just to the top of the knee. i' 5' 4"" tall. to lighten up the dress just a little so that it does not look as some have said ""frumpy"" i hemmed the liner so that the liner hem is half way up on the ruffle. this makes the dress look less heavy, more fun, and repeats the openness of the lace on top. love this dress! will be wore a lot for summer evenings out.",pos
"So sad becuase i like the design. i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment. i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight. i had to take the sweater off and work in a t-shirt. 
the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve",neg
I absolutely love everything about this dress. it can be dressed up or down. no complaints.,pos
"This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full, but this one is just too voluminous. also, the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust. this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric. so disappointed, the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too. this can be worn year round, with sandals or boots.",pos
"The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic. the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didn't seem right to me. it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright, but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl. i will be returning the sweater because of that.",neg
"Wow... great top, i have all the colors now. wow like them all. great weight cozy but not too heavy. nice that no pilling either! love it.",pos
"This is a wonderful top! the fabric is soft and comfortable, with a beautiful drape. the pattern is very pretty, the curved hems are very flattering, and the top is versatile. it can be worn with shorts, as shown, or a skirt with a belt or pants. i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange, yellow and green, and this top looked amazing with all of them. a great little find!",pos
"I am in love with this dress and can't wait to wear it to brunch this weekend! i am normally a ps, but they only had the pxs which i took a chance on. fits like a glove. slightly tight in the chest area, but i am chesty for a petite girl. the length is perfect and modest, the detail up front is adorable.",pos
I absolutely am obsessed with this poncho! it is the perfect piece for fall and so easy to layer.,pos
"I think this fits to true to size. i am 5""2 and 107 lbs. i always wear a xs. it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra (34b). if i wore a normal very little padding bra, it did not pull much across the bust.",pos
"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3""",pos
"This is what i'd been looking for without even knowing it! it's long without being too long, and most importantly - its soft, not scratchy the way so many winter clothes can be. i wasn't sure if i should order the small or the medium so i went with the medium, and it fits great. the weave is just slightly wide, but not to the point where you have to wear a cami or tee underneath, but the fit is loose enough that you can, if you want to for added warmth. i really like it.",pos
"This sweater was exactly what i was looking for...something well made, cozy, easy to just throw on and go and still look chic. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs and the x-small fit perfectly - still roomy but drapes well. i got the taupe which is nice but i got the red color for my sister in law and its gorgeous- more of a burnt orange than the red show here. i would definitely recommend this sweater!",pos
"First, i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short, because, well, it is. that being said, it is a perfect length for someone who is petite, like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets, which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size, is wonderfully warm and cozy, and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :)",pos
This sweater is a must have for fall!! super comfy yet stylish fit make it fun to dress up or down. i plan on wearing it with leggings and high boots!,pos
"I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me, it's not true at all, i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable, but it was simply too short (rather than 20"" as it states on the website, it's more like 18""), which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po",neg

Soooooo cute. fit like a dream. look like regular pants. could dress up or dress down. i bought the grey and the slight herringbone pattern was so adorable. going to buy in the black as well. normally wear size 4-6 got the small and fits perfect.,pos

"Such a pretty skirt. i think it's a very versatile piece. a bit heavier, can't wait to wear when it cools down more. i saw the dress that is similar to the skirt in the catalog last month and loved it too. note the skirt does not have the same shine in the fabric that the dress does.",pos
Tried this on in the store and fell in love. it's such a simple shirt but the details are special. runs tts. will get a lot of use out of this.,pos
Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one. i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top. possibly better on smaller chests. the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good. not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs. going back :(,neg

Such a cute take on a henley/button down shirt! i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversized/tunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots. i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look. i'm just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size! i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks. yea! these shirts are so soft and made of substan,pos
"I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer.",pos
"This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i don't",pos

"I first spotted this on an retailer employee, she paired it with a peasant top & wore it open w/jeans & boots- so darn cute. love how this peice transitions from summer to fall. i'm 5'4"" so i had to order the small petite which is perfect. note that this dress is very long! it's just a must have garment. the colors/ print are just beautiful.",pos

"For the price of this dress, i was expecting something decent. the style is cute, but nothing more. however, the type of the polyester that the dress is made of.... oh my. it is a thick unpleasant material, that will cling to a body when it is hot. i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaply.

"I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item...",neg
"This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.",pos
"This is a dress for a princess. i admire this dress so much, online and in person. i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store. the beads throughout the dress provide a low-key surprise sparkle, especially in the sun. the colors are much more vibrant in person, which is breathtaking against the light cream background. the fabric is soft and flowy. unfortunately for me, it doesn't fit right. size 6 fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy",pos

"I am very happy with this suit! it is gorgeous and very well made. my only suggestion is to use your normal swimsuit size when ordering rather than their recommendations. i am a 4-6 in dress size but am curvy with a large bust. i went with a medium because i thought there was no way i would wear a small! the medium actually fits great in the waist and bottom, however is small in the top for me. i'm ordering a large to compare coverage.",pos
"I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress, especially because it looks so beautiful on the model. the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash, it's already developing a tiny hole and pilling. also, it is definitely not a ""day dress""--i wore it as a swim coverup, but it is much too thin and pajama-like to be worn as an actual dress. the color is much different in person--the blue is brighter and, for lack of a better way to describe it, cheap looking. the white banding around the t",neg

Very comfy versatile skirt. the fabric is soft and stretchy that feels really nice on. i live in hawai'i so i like having skirts to wear that work well with the climate but not typical of the fashion out here. the pleating is very flattering and the skirt layer underneath makes it wearable to work.,pos

"I tried it on at store and went back to buy it once it hit the sale rack. not the kind of dress that grabbed my attention online, but once i put it on i knew that it would find a way to my closet. the fabric is high quality, and there is lots of it. the color, the weight, the pockets- i love everything about it. i see how it might not work for everyone, but for me (5'7, 135 lb, 36b) xs is a great fit.",pos
"Love this tank! the purple motif is gorgeous, and the carbon color is a rich dark gray with a slight blue tinge. at 5'4"" / 130# with a fairly proportionate torso to leg ratio, i sometimes need a petite in tops like this to avoid the armholes being too long. in this top i found the petite small too short, but the regular small was perfect. the waist hits right above my natural waist, the hem is just a skosh lower than the model photo, and the armholes are the right length. beautiful flattering cu",pos
"This is an amazing top. fits perfectly, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. i actually came back to the site just so i could order it in all available colors, but unfortunately it's only in navy. don't hesitate to buy this!",pos
"Ordered this online in a petite 4. (i'm 5'3""/130#). fits very nicely but for the amount of fabric this dress has (3 layers total), i think a 2p will be a better choice and not look as full, maybe a little more fitted, which will be more attractive at the top on me.

however, the detailing on the dress is really beautiful and high quality. the dress has quite a bit of weight to it with the top swingy layer, a tulle like layer for shape and then the sheath like slip. the colors are all very dark",pos
"A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes. i mix them with my basics, scarves and jewelry. so, i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses, even though i felt it was pretty pricey. when it arrived, i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric. it does nothing for any of my intended clothes, so it is going back asap.",neg
This top looks even better in person! the green is a little brighter than the photo. this beautiful blouse is silk with a sold underlining. it is very full and has great flow and movement. super trendy with the open shoulders and a nice long sleeve for fall. it's really beautiful and perfect for any festive occasion!!,pos
"I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot. i typically wear an xs or s, and purchased the small. glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug. i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth. it's a little low cut for me, but i'll wear a cami under it.",pos
I was going to order a size 2 online but decided to check my local store first (hate paying for shipping - especially when so many retailers offer free shipping regardless of the purchase amount). all that was left was a 0 and 10. i decided to go ahead and try the 0 just for size comparison. i'm usually a size 2 but this dress fit perfect in the 0. a 2 probably would have been ok but may have been a bit looser in the top. i love the lace fabric on the top and the contrast it provides to the skir,pos

"This very unique dress is exquisite and so versatile ? suitable for daytime or evening, and will look great with a cardigan and tights for year-round wear. it fits perfectly and seems true to size to me ? i?m 5?2?, about 112 pounds, and got an xs. the description says the dress can be machine washed, but with the delicate trim around the neckline, i plan to hand-wash it carefully. so happy with this purchase!",pos
"I tried this dress at a store today and ended up ordering it online. i tried the red which is a beautiful, vibrant color. i wasn't sure how it looked on my skin tone though (pale like death), so i ordered the black. i do believe it runs small in the chest and shoulders. i am normally a size 4 in shirts, but the buttons were straining over my chest and my shoulders felt constricted. i tried the 6 and it was plenty roomy. for reference, i am a 32c with athletic shoulders. overall...

I love the cut of this dress! i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it! the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design. so i would say stick with your usual size. amazing pop of color especially for summer. the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it  are wonderful. do yourselves a favor and just try it on!,pos
I just received this in the wine color and it's gorgeous! it fits well and is very pretty. it can be dressed up or down. i can't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this. i have already ordered the other color! great purchase.,pos
"I order this sweater in black - size small - and i just love it. i'm a slender 5' 9"" 130 lbs and the small is perfect in for me. while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized ""boyfriend"" feel to it, the rounded front hem, hip pockets, and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem (where the rounded hem begins) are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailer's clothing. the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality, but it is perfect for my minneapol",pos

"Ordered online, and when it came i was very excited to open it - but the photo doesn't show how incredibly wide the cut is. it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me - 5'9, 130. the embroidery is lovely, but the style doesn't work. i had a small, but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height. might work better on someone with a more petite frame, but i do caution how ""voluminous"" the cut",neg

This dress is very well made. the fabric is thick enough for winter weather and is great for work or a nice party. i do not think the arm openings are too large at all.,pos
Love love the fit and material. a must fall wardrobe.,pos
"I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn, winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length, too.",pos
"I wanted these jeans so badly! i originally ordered them in my regular size -a 27. they were too big even for a tomboy fit, so i ordered a 26. the size 26 order was backordered and then cancelled. i am so sad! i would absolutely buy these if i could get them in my size. they are so soft and beautiful. i love ag's quality.",pos
What a nice sweater! i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters i've gotten in a long time. the fit is true to size. the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms. the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing. the weight is perfect for every season. i am very happy with everything about this sweater.,pos
"Wow this dress is very flattering! i have a fairly small waist and not-so-small hips and this dress is slimming. it is also soft, light, airy, gorgeous! exactly what you need on a beautiful spring day! i wore this dress yesterday and have not felt that beautiful in a very long time! thank you so much retailer for the brilliant design:)",pos
I debated forever about ordering this and so glad i did! the colors are so pretty. i got the yellow and it's slightly sheer but ok w/ a nude bra. regarding fit- completely tts imo. i'm a 8/10 and 38 c and the med is perfect. i am so happy i did not size up.,pos
This is a nicely made and comfortable sweater that is fun to wear. i have worn it with jeans and a t shirt and have received compliments on it.,pos
This top is perfect!! i am small chested and it actually makes me look like i have a chest! plus for me!! it's also great for work and casual.,pos
"I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also, it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back.",neg
"I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!",pos
"Love this sweater. ordered white, size large. great light layer! the weave in the yarn is really pretty; the variations in texture have an almost burnout look. the silver buttons are unusual, really stand out and complement the overall look of the sweater. it has an uneven hem that drapes beautifully at the back and sides. great value on sale! one of those basics that everyone needs in their wardrobe.",pos
"Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than ""blue"" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust, blue, goldenrod, green throughout. super soft, stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33"" bust, long torso, broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in.",pos
"I love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself... it runs a size larger - i am usually a 4 and the 2 fits perfectly. the skort was one size off for my clients too. definitely a great choice for spring/summer, especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle!",pos
The price is high and i have to dry clean this? no thanks.,neg
"These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5"" and the size 4 fit in the waist, but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on, they're also very poofy right below the waist.",neg
"It's beautiful, lovely quality, gorgeous bird. but the fit just doesn't work for me. i'm usually a medium, which is what i got, it's just too tight in the chest. for ref 36d. as is it already flares out some in the bottom so i'm not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately",neg

This is now one of my favorite retailer button downs. it's super soft and super flattering. it's everything you'd want this cute shirt to be!,pos
This shirt is true to size. it has beautiful detail and feels very soft and comfortable. it can be worn to dress up jeans or with a skirt for a night out for dinner.,pos
"I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it ""runs small"" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!",pos
I love this top. fit is perfect for me. shows just the right amount of cleavage. wore it to dinner on my birthday and got a ton of compliments!,pos
"I needed to get this hemmed about 3-4 inches, but it was well worth it. this is a gorgeous, effortlessly glam outfit. the material is silky soft, with some stretch, and drapes beautifully. i am a 12/14 and got an xl-- i think a large would have been better (this had extra width at the waist, but it worked with the tie belt). i loved wearing this and felt comfortable all night.",pos
This whole order was disappointing. the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items - this sweater included were poorly made. there was a snag/thread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater - tried to tuck it in but it wouldn't stay so i'll be returning it.,neg
"There were no reviews when i purchased this dress. from the picture with the model, the dress looks to be a straight shift dress. i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isn't straight. it is also pretty large. i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and i'm not sure i will keep it. still on the fence. dress is shorter than pictured as well. sleeves are shorter than shown. now, after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture, i think the model is holding her a",neg
"The model looks awesome in this cute top, but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short (for reference, i'm 5'7,"" 140 lbs., and 34c). the front is non-stretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric, yet the back is stretchy. in theory, it's pretty, but in reality it doesn't work - at least for me. i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest.",neg
"I bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here. i think the length is perfect. so many of the tees, etc. are extra long, so it's nice to have a variety to chose from. i'm 5'5"" and this little tee hits right where my legs begin. it is very free flowing and cool. i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot.",pos
I bought the xs and love it. it looks better on than in the picture. it travels well (no wrinkles after being in the suitcase) and it is generous on the sides so you can actually eat a full lunch and not feel boxed in afterwards.,pos

"Love, love this dress! the fit is perfect, the cut is feminine and flirty but not too showy and bare. there is the perfect amount of swing and it's a great length, i can't say enough about it. i think it's worth the price, which i have to admit, i was hesitant about. so comfortable and versatile! i see it being worn quite often!

I wore this dress to a party once and haven't been able to find an outfit that can top it!,pos
The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.,neg
"Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way, it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price.",pos
"Incredibly flattering cut! i got so many compliments when i wore this dress to a friend's wedding. with the built in bra, you don't have to add extra uncomfortable layers. it stays put with or without the straps! the skirt is blissfully full and fun for twirling. i had a little trouble figuring out the belt, as it wraps around multiple times. but once i worked that out, it was perfect! love this cut! i hope they make it again it different colors!",pos

I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.,pos

Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!,neg
Nice rendition of a summer halter that resembles denim. i bought my normal small but could have downsized to an xs. if your busty stay with your normal size as it is more tts. i like the blue plaid colors and the soft cotton material it's made of. it has a very nice flow with the cute peek a boo back neckline. the interior fabric lining is also a quite lovely chambray blue that nicely offsets the blue plaid.,pos

i also like that the pleats that create the ruffle are sewn nicely (sometimes my recent purchases from retailer have not been the best qua",pos
"The simplicity of this t-shirt will go with jeans, shorts, or anything casual. the macrame and bead details give it that extra style. i bought the red and white, and love them both. the red is warm and bright, with pink undertones. despite the boxiness of the fit, it ran true to size for me. i did not think it was too big; its meant to be loose and slouchy rather than fitted.",pos
"Can't say enough about this cute dress....i bought it in red/ which is more of a burgundy, and paired it with a pair of over the knee burgundy boots. i can see wearing this in the spring, summer; heck, all year round! quality is nice and the gold zipper down the top of the back is a classy touch. don't pass this one up!",pos

"True to size. length is perfect for 5'8""-5'9"". soft fabric. not too low cut in the front, but not all covered up either. ruching is subtle and does not add bulk. skirt portion skims curves, neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them. strap design is perfect, covers bra while revealing a touch of skin. comfortable and effortless to wear, very very pretty.",pos
"I wanted to love this coat so bad. the material is lovely and it's beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off. if you have any hips forget it (my hips are 38"")- you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy. the jacket also ran funny across the shoulders....like the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted, it was weird. but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasn't a size thing. i bought a size medium, at 5'5"" and 140 pounds.",neg
"This top is absolutely gorgeous! it fits true to size to slightly large. i'd say size down if you are between sizes. it has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but for a winter season top - it is not too thin. colors are as pictured. i can pair this with black pants or with skinny jeans. it is a top that i will wear for years to come.",pos

"I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!",neg

This bra is so well made and fits beautifully.,pos
"This top is has an awkward neckline, doesn't lay like the photo (as mentioned by another reviewer.) see threw, and of poor quality. the fit is very baggy and unflattering. and material is very thin. it also runs very large!! the color is pretty, but that is it :(",neg
"At last, in a world of loose, billowy silhouettes, a draped top that falls a little closer to the body! the fabric is of good weight and has the right amount of stretch.

i also love the retro/vintage pattern of the fabric itself. the fit is feminine and comfortable.

you will have to wear a camisole with this top, but i do not consider that a negative. it is the way of the deep v neck.",pos
"Thick, soft, awesome quality - what's not to love?! i've had an awful time finding a new black warm cardigan this year to throw over anything from a tee to a casual dress, and this finally fits the bill! while it is soft like a sweatshirt, i would definitely not say that this is purely loungewear. nice enough to replace my old ratty sweaterknit!",pos
"Ordered this on a whim while taking advantage of a promotion, and now need one in every color! the weight and cut is perfect for fall/winter/summer - not too heavy, but not sheer/tissue thin; fitted enough to look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans. fabric has a nice quality feel to it - i have similar shirts from the past that have held up well in the wash. i'm anticipating the same with this.",pos
"Gorgeous blush color, soft flowing material made for a perfect outdoor summer wedding guest dress. the elastic around the waist could have been slightly tighter as the dress is a bit weighted but not loose enough to deter my purchase. i'm curvy and this dress was very flattering. i'm on the shorter side and didn't buy the petite (it wasn't available in store and i bought this the day before the wedding); i had to pick up the dress to walk up steps but was fine otherwise in 2 inch heels. i receiv",pos
Beautiful dress. the dress appears more blue in the picture- it is actually green. made well- i love it!,pos
"I got this dress in the navy blue and it fits perfect. there is a little too much fabric in the middle, but it allows the dress the stretch more. the fabric on the button is a little thin and not lined, but you really can't see anything through it. i'm 5'2"" and usually purchase the petite, but the regular fit just fine and hit me about mid knee. the petite would have probably been too short.",pos
"I got this tank because it was on sale, thinking it could be cute, but i didn't have high hopes. once i put it on, i loved it. i have a long torso and it's the perfect length. i have worn it with a jacket over it also to extend its life into cooler weather.",pos
"A mango beauty that resonates the color of blossoms in bloom. comfortable, effortless, and charming. i wear a size small in retailer dresses and this one fit true to size for me. tried the xs since reviews mentioned it ran large, but too tight across my average chest. looks great with denim jacket and red suede strappy sandals. also worn with a belt to accentuate waist.",pos
"This romper is so flattering. i normally don't like how short rompers are, but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me. not to mention that it's super comfortable. i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements. very happy i bought it! i normally wear a medium, but the small fit me perfectly?i'd recommend sizing down.",pos
"Love this little number. very flattering, warm, and soft. color goes with everything, i tried it on with a slip dress, and it added class and warmth... big button details are fun well-made and beautiful cut. i ordered xxs petite, and it fit like a glove, with room for something underneath if needed. i also ordered te xs petite, as my stylist was afraid xxs would be small, but will keep xxs p after actually trying it on.

"I live in hawaii and always looking for a comfortable light and breezy dresses, this was perfect. the colors are gorgeous, the fit is true to size and it is extremely comfortable. dress it up or dress it down with a denim jacket and you will be definitely love it. i am thrilled i made the purchase!!",pos
Super comfy and longer than last year's version minus the hood. love it!,pos
I'm fairly petite and was not expecting this to be as long as it was on me- it's actually great for leggings or skinny jeans though- good quality material too!,pos
"I love everything about this dress. it is comfortable, classic, good quality and fits really well. there are two layers to the material so nothing is see through.the styling on the back is to die for. there is a subtle gold line that runs through the blue and white stripes. the first day i wore this i received 5 compliments while shopping in a single store!

it is a bit loose in the middle, but i paired it with a skinny belt and it was the perfect fix. i can usually wear petite or regular. i p",pos

"I bought this on sale and absolutely love it. i bought the xs, i'm 5'10, 145 lbs and a b/c cup and it fit well. i am considering sewing in cups, since i don't like using stick-on bras as much and none of my other bras work with the back. that really is my only complaint about the dress, everything else is great!",pos
Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.,neg
"I got the yellow ones and love them so much i ordered the stone color. very comfortable and i can wear in th office or on the weekend. thinking about ordering every color! i love the pilcro hyphen line. fits my 5'4"" frame and athletic build perfectly! i'm 135 lbs and wear a size 28.",pos
I didn't notice this online but it caught my eye in the store. the colors are bright and beautiful. i wear a 10/12 or m/l. i tried the 12 but the bust was too big (i wear a 36c). i ordered the size 10 and it fits perfect. i'm so glad i saw it in the store. i think it makes much more of an impact in person than online.,pos
This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.,pos
"I saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself - i have to have that top! it is perfect for the fall season. the pattern/print is very intricate and lovely. i think it fits true to size - the petite xxs is just right. the sleeves do not come to the wrist, but the photo here depicts that already. the elastic in the arms feel a little tight, but that would be my own negative comment. the fabric is beautiful and flows just right - it does not feel to big to me at all. i'm s",pos

"These ultra-slimming jeans are so comfy. the rise is a little higher than i am used to but it covers those little muffin tops perfectly. the color is very dark - almost black which adds to the slimming effect. i have really long legs and these have a little extra at the bottom, which is great. you could wear with flats, booties, boots - just about any type of shoes. these are my new favorite jeans.",pos
"Love everything about this dress -- i ordered the 'red' which is more of a 'red orange' / with cream and beige - as pictured, colors are beautiful. the dress has a nice 'drape' / great feel, love it !",pos
"I love this peasant top! i didn't expect it to be made from such nice fabric. usually, i have to wear a camisole under a lot of retailer tops, but not this one! i bought a petite xs and if fits perfectly. thank you to retailer for selling petite clothes.",pos
"The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on, but the top is very poorly designed. it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back. you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear. once i got it on, it fit perfectly though. getting out of it was a disaster. i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip. overall, i was crushed that it didn't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering.",neg
Great fit and extremely comfortable.,pos
Good quality tank. very flowy and longer if you are short.,pos
"I love this sweater! aside from it being absolutely adorable, the quality is great and the sizing is accurate. i have received so many compliments on it so far and honestly, i want to wear it everyday! the sweater is super soft and comfy... and of course, i totally recommend it! thanks retailer!!",pos
"Believe the reviews - this dress is very flattering, great quality, and an excellent print (i got the polka dot). i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty - 32dd - but this looks great, is appropriate for work. love!",pos
"I love this skirt! so soft and comfortable, i wore it casual with black nike sneakers, a black loose turtleneck top and a moto leather jacket. i tried on the m and l and went with the m, so i would say it is true to size because that is what i usually wear. i'm 5'9', 145 lbs,
nice thick fabric, but not heavy, good for cool weather.",pos
"I ordered this shirt in the grey/blue color choice; the creamy grey is perfectly heathered and the blue silk-like bottom is a classy touch. the fit of this shirt in the arms, torso, and back was flattering with a little room to drape. love it!",pos
It's a bit baggy (i'm normally a 6/8 medium but went with the small here). i debated for a while but finally went for it on sale and i'm so glad. the colors are just gorgeous in person. delicate stitching on the shoulders adds a feminine touch. great with my jean jacket which gathers up the extra material just right. looks great with summer sandals and booties for fall. i love love love this dress!,pos
"This dress is versatile and cute! i purchased the xxs at 5'4"" 115lbs and it fit perfect. a steal at the sale price!",pos
"Soft knit, perfectly finished, comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers' mom.  it just looks too 'empty-nester' for my style (and i won't be until 2035!)  this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer, which i'm not.  i'm also messy so it's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free.  i'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments.  just had to pass on this for personal style reasons.",pos
I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made.

"Really love the pattern and color combination. the dress has an attached lining to around the knee. i would say this is tts or a little big. i'm 5'8"" and around 135 and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist. print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long, lean look. i love the feeling of effortlessness--with cute sandals this is an outfit.",pos
"This was such an impulse buy- i bought it online during a sweater sale- and i am so glad i did! this is definitely one of my favorite recent purchases. it definitely seems more like a coat than a sweater, but it is lightweight. i ordered the red and it is beautiful. it looks great buttoned or left open and i think this could be dressed up or down (though it does have a hood, so that gives it a slightly more casual feel). it fits true to size- and it is definitely shorter in the front than the ba",pos
"I wish i could wear this sweater every day! it is extremely soft. runs large. 5'9"", 130lbs, bought a large and it was way too big, but i successfully shrunk it in the dryer. sleeves are too bulky. it's not perfection, especially the sleeves. the photo shows the models with the sleeves pushed up. there is no way you could do that. they are almost like bell sleeves, and the material stretches like crazy. wish i had ordered down, but still love it.",pos
"I ordered this dress online. the colors are pretty (if you like pastels) and the fit is true to size, however, it fits very much like a maternity dress. for those of you rocking a baby bump, this is a good choice. for others who are not, it's just not flattering. my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me. i returned it.",neg
"This is just adorable on. i go between a small and medium and the small was perfect for me.. i wore this with tights and boots, but can also see this working in warmer weather with sandals or peep-toe booties.",pos
"I'm calling this the ""gateway jumpsuit"" for all those ladies who are wondering about this whole jumpsuit trend and how they feel about it--you know who you are. this jumper is flattering, comfortable, elevated--and worth trying on! i'm petite but long-waisted with curves on the bottom, which can be a tough combo when trying to find a jumper. i actually ordered the petite 2 first, which was better fitting in the waist area but i ended up ultimately purchasing the regular 2 since i preferred where",pos
Just got this shirt in the mail and i am absolutely in love! i paired it with jeans and brown boots and got so many compliments. the shirt is light and flowy. it very flattering for any body shape.,pos
Very pretty top with beautiful lace detail both front and back. love the way the material feels and it hangs very nice....actually slimming. i purchased the black & would highly recommend.,pos
"A perfect basic tee!
loved how soft it is. not worth full price, but definitely one to add to your cart once on sale.",pos
"My husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on. i don't normally go for patterns like this, but i thought it was cute and springy.

i tried on a large first, since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders. (i'm tall, big boned and 175 pounds) the large actually stuck out funny at the bottom and didn't do much for my shape.

the medium, however was great! it was long enough to hide my belly and cover enough of my waistband that i wouldn't",pos
"I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model, but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top, and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.",pos
"This is my second pair of joggers from retailer and since this purchase, i have bought another pair. it seems that they are just a great fit for my body, long and lean, but not extreme. someone said they run large, but my experience is true to size. these pants can be very casual around the house, out for errands or dressed up and worn for casual evenings out. i love that the elastic waist isn't bunchee. they hang very straight and pretty, just like in this picture. the fabric has some text",pos
This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!,pos
"I ordered my normal size 32. they were a little tight however i'm glad because they normally stretch out quite a bit so i'm assuming they should fit perfect after one wearing. the length is fine for my 5'9 height and they are very soft.. i'm so happy with the light red color, it's almost a rust which i love.",pos
"Love the jeans! the color is listed as black for some reason but they are definitely blue like the picture. and what i love most is i've always wanted somewhat distressed jeans but for me the ripped jeans look doesn't work. these are perfectly distressed without being hole-y. i also love the length. i'm usually a 29"" person because i love ankle length for boots (tall and short). these are listed i think a bit shorter than that i think but didn't feel cropped. they are also made of some special """,pos
"Love this top for work. loose, flattering and enough detail to be noticed. fits tts and goes with everything.",pos
This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.,pos
Perfect! awesome! i have a few of these now and love them. they do stretch a little so i wouldn't size up. i'm about 138 pounds and 5'8'' and normally m. i wear the 27 in these.,pos

"My skirt arrived this week and its beautiful! i'm so happy i splurged on it. i'm usually a size 6 and the medium fits perfect, although it is quite long (i'm 5'2"" though;). i will probably get it hemmed, but went ahead and wore it anyway and actually found i like it a bit long and its very comfortable. the fabric is very high quality and the color is stunning.",pos
"Usually wear s and xs, tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up. if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight. the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low. it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way. two layers, green on outside, and a polyester beige layer underneath.

but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket.",neg
"The fabric is thin, though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!",pos
"Warm and cozy tights for my daughter, she loves them!",pos
These citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money. they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are huge...very versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top. add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look. i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute. it's a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans.,pos
"This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase. the fit is so flattering. i think this dress runs true to size-i usually wear a size 6 in hd in paris, and that's what size i ordered. i expect i could have fit in a 4 but the 6 is comfortable. i am 5'4'' but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee. i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining. however-- i just laundered this dress for the first time-hand wash, lay flat to dry (as recommended) and this dr",neg

the fit was perfect. they will surely make a statement wherever i choose to wear them.",pos
"This skirt looks just like it does on the model. it is the prefect maxi skirt with lots of movement. i actually bought the off the shoulder top it is paired with. you can't tell on the model but the slit has buttons up it so you can undo or do as many of the buttons as you want to show off as much leg as you want. it is a little pricey,but well worth it.",pos
"I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person, it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall, it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon",neg

Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it's a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.,pos
"More of an a-line rather than tunic shape--which makes this a great, flattering, spring-through-summer party and barbecue throw on. true to size, washable. the indigo and purpley-gray pop with the mix of rose stripes, and the fringe and length keep it from being dowdy. i'm 5'5"" and this hit mid thigh. i keep pulling it out of the closet and trying it on! can't wait for the weather to turn in earnest to wear this sassiness out.",pos
"I love this dress! i will be living in it this fall and winter! the color is perfect, the fabric is soft, seriously it is so conformable and cute! i will style it with booties, tall boots, with vests, wear it as a tunic! i love it as a dress, i didn't think it was too short at all! i'm 5'7"" so things tend to be short on my anyway but i thought this was perfect and hit in the right spots! love love love it!",pos
"I purchased this in navy and love it. my only complaint is that is is a little big in the shoulders. i am about 5'4"", 129 lbs and the small is still a bit too big. aside from that, it is a great design and length and i've worn it both with jeans and leggings / boots.",pos
"A fun, casual romper. i loved the pink color (not usually my thing), which looks great with darker skin. like another reviewer said, the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes (i took a size 6 in this, but am usually a 2/4) - this will make the top part a bit blousy, but i think that adds to the appeal/ look.",pos

Very flatttering skirt ! super cute ! highly recommend !,pos

I am very petite and ordered the xs. it is too big which is often the case. i gauge how much i like something by my willingness to spend even more money on alterations. i love this jacket so much that i am willing to go through that extra step. i love winter and this is a perfect winter top. the faux fur is very soft and cozy and has a rich look to it. i have yet to have it altered which is the only reason for my 4 stars under quality. i don't yet know how it will fit once complete. the fact tha,pos

Fits beautifully. perfect for spring and summer. the cut of this skirt gives your figure a wonderful shape. the quality of the material is excellent.  this item is perfect for to dress up for a date night or wear slightly more casually for a brunch.,pos

This is such a cute top. perfect for fall layered with a sweater!,pos

"Hadn't really looked at this dress till i saw it in person in the store. so i tried it on. i'm only 5'1 and 140 lb. busty on top so i tried the 8. it was a smidge snug, decided since the dress has no give to go with a 10. would have liked this in a petite for the shorter length, but it's back ordered till august and i really wanted to take it with me on vacation. its just above my ankles in regular length, which will work and i can up the score with some wedges. this dress fits like a dream and",pos
"I love this little number. the quality is terrific, the weight is perfect, and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy, without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one, but i noticed the color is labeled ""chartreuse"". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in ""real life""?",pos
"Gorgeous colors, great neckline (can be worn off one shoulder), the slits on the side allow for wear as tunic or as half tucked. very cute.",pos
"Knitted and knotted makes such gorgeous sweaters:  this is bathed in lovely, almost impresssionistic color, and the deep ruffle at the bottom is feminine and flattering.  i adored the way there's enough wrap-around to get cozy in it, as i wore it through my day.  i went with the green in a regular medium, which is my normal size:  size 8, 34f.  the 27% mohair enhances the soft feeling and lush look.  as i wore this piece today, i felt that i was wearing something very special.",pos
"I love this vest. i think it is heavy for a warm spring/summer day so kind've surprised it was featured at the store early spring. i waited for it to go on sale and purchased my normal retailer size medium. i agree it may seem big or loose fitting but i am a vest girl and the fit for me is perfect. size 34 dd, 145 lbs and 5 ft 4 in height. it is a great finishing piece for causal or office attire. this vest will definitely stay in my closet for a long time. beautiful quality.",pos
Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it,pos
"I recommend this dress because it is beautiful, stylish and well made even though it did not work for me. i tried the small and extra small. the first - way too big, lengthwise (hit my knees) as well as in the shoulders - the latter to tight across the chest - not for me but worth a try. i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length.",neg
"I have to admit, seeing these tops online, i wouldn't give them a second glance, but at my local store they were displayed in a gorgeous summery fashion and were so light and airy and flowy (my summer checklist!) i bought both the blue and rust color in an xl. i am a 16/xl/36h and this is one of the few button up shirts that actually fit! i think i might go in and add a snap between the bust line anyway since the buttons are spaced too generously, but there is no pulling. this top does run long,",pos
This sweater is much more beautiful in person. the quality is very good and the fur is nice too!! i am 5'8 inches and 155 lbs and the medium fit me perfect.,pos
"Maybe the softest sweater that i own. buy it, and you won't regret it!",pos
"The shorts have a linen look but have just a touch of stretch to them which is great for keeping their shape. i'm 5.7"" 140lbs and the shorts hit about 5"" down my thigh which is just long enough to cover but still sexy. the 29's fit but snug all over. the 30's gave a looser look but still fit in the waist. i have the navy and the mango. definitely recommend.",pos
"I am 5'8"" 140 lbs and the m fits perfectly. it is flowy and feminine but the tie in the back keeps it from looking boxy. pattern is really nice. great dress!",pos
"I agree with the previous reviewer - the color variation is much more subtle than what is shown online. i would not have bought it had i not seen it ""in real life"". this is a super cute, soft and comfortable shirt. it fits tts and can be worn with jeans, leggings or a skirt. for reference i'm 5""7 and 122 lbs and i took a small but probably could have gone with xs as well but i like the extra room.",pos
"Love this cardigan, ordered the red which is a nice tomato red, but not orange. sz medium fits perfect on my frame, 34dd, 145 lbs and 5 '4. love the style and finishes a pant, skirt or dress nicely. i just may order the black ! did not see this item in the store near me, but lucky to order it on sale. beautiful quality.",pos
The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn't buy even on sale.,neg
This is a cross between a sweater and a sweatshirt. not a heavy weight but very warm. the color is vibrant. many compliments.,pos
"This is a unique color, and a lovely dress. i have the yellow, and i didn't find that it ran large. it definitely has a loose, flowing fit, and you can wear with or without a belt for different looks. the pleated fabric near the waist does fit differently than the other fabrics, but i don't think it looks odd. you have several pictures of people wearing them, and you can see that it looks amazing on everyone!",pos
"Fun to wear inside sneakers or just around the house shoeless. my daughters tried to take them, but i held on to them.",pos
Love this tshirt! casual but can be dressed up with wedges and a scarf!,pos
Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!,pos
Perfect fall top! extra long sleeves perfect for keeping the chill off.,pos
Not tissue thin like most tees and easily can be dressed up to wear to work in a casual setting. i find myself reaching for this tee weekly! have every color! i usually avoid stripes however this tee seems to flatter and slim! love!,pos
I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.,pos
"Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink, as shown. very happy with this purchase!",pos
"I have purchased many of retailer's henley tees throughout the years. this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store. i love the look of the crisp, white, but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami, and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hot.

anyhow, this shirt is made in my favorite spring/summer tee shirt fabric: 100%s linen. linen gets so soft and drapey over time. the yoke is lace. the arms have a small ruching that is sewn, not buttoned up l",pos
Beautiful shirt for a great price. i love a good striped shirt and i got it on sale!,pos
"I was disappointed in this shirt. the color was not the pretty blue pictured, but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette, but not on a blonde. the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily. normally, the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses, but this one felt cheap. the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful, and i wish this shirt would have worked for me. i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it. holding horses is one of",neg
I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.,pos
I loved the way this sweater was made.  my arms are really short so the sleeves were way too long and looked silly rolled.,pos
"Although i was worried it wouldn't live up to its sticker price, i'm glad i bought this shirt. it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes. the lace details make it seem dressy and special. the fabric feels luxurious. sleeves are almost too short for my long arms, but they are good enough.",pos
"I didn't buy it for the longest time based on the other reviews but i finally did and i love it. great color, great quality, great fit. oh and great price too! i say - go for it.",pos
"Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing, i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.",pos
"I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired. it fits tts, length is fine...the inside is some, but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap (kinda canvas feeling?). the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way. it also is on the thinnish side - it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm. this is definitely going back.",neg
This dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors. it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece. planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater.,pos
Very nicely made sweater which fits well. i bought the black with white accent and am very pleased with my purchase. the small fit me perfectly (34d) can't wait to wear it this fall!,pos
"This top is really beautiful, but looks absolutely horrible on my 5'9"" apple shaped body. in the words of my husband, i looked like a star trek villain.",neg
"I normally wear a size 12 because of my shoulders and back. after reading reviews after purchasing dress online, i was expecting it to be too small. it is, in fact, somewhat large. i love the way i feel in it. i am 5'8 and the length is perfect. i cannot wait to wear it. the black is so soft. love the boho feel, yet classic and feminine..",pos
"The quality of this vest is outstanding, and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days, in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style, but i am 5'1"", 100 lbs and i can carry it off.",pos
"I love the lacy details on the skirt. this dress is perfectly simple, yet can be dressed up too. as the evenings get cooler, it pairs up nicely with a cropped denim jacket or a cardigan.",pos
"As a beach cover-up this would be great, but i'm surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesn't show on the model how thin it is. it's pretty sheer and i couldn't get away without layering it.",neg
"This sweater is very lightweight with the loose knit, but is much warmer than i was expecting. the periwinkle color is gorgeous. the chiffon hem provides a cute detail and it is true to size for a loose fit",pos
"I tried this on in the store, and i found my regular medium to be a bit too boxy. i ended up going with the petite large because i found it just fit better. it wasn't too wide and fit just right.
it is very soft, not itchy at all. it says dry clean only but it did great on my hand wash setting with cold water. laid it out to dry. great purchase.",pos
I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.,neg
"Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest, this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!",neg
"This is the most beautiful and flattering skirt. it was a bit of an investment piece for me in that i just graduated from college, but i love that this skirt can be worn year round. it is more fitted at the top and then flows out at the bottom, making it super flattering. pictures do not do it justice!",pos
"Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.",neg
"Note: the inseam runs a little longer than stated above. if you are truly a 29"" inseam, you may want to get the petite size. i purchased the petite small, my inseam is 27"", and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet. however, the length can be changed depending on where you wear/place them on your hip.
i've worn these trousers at home and around town with ease. they are a wonderful cold weather, go-to wardrobe staple. i wear a nylon trouser ""slip"" with them to prolong the need for cleaning",pos
"Soft and unique. love the sleeves. my usual size medium fits perfectly. per the other reviewer, i guess my bust is large enough for the flowers to be on the side and not directly on breasts! my only wish is that it has some embroidery on it....love!!",pos
"This fit perfectly. i am 5'7 , 138 pounds and ordered a small. i was very pleased with the way it draped over my body. i bought the black one.",pos
"Hesitant at first to spend so much on a swimsuit. definitely worth the money, quality all around..style..fit. appreciated the review i read prior to purchase, to size up! so happy i was able to get it on sale as well! $120.00 roughly but can see why it cost so much!",pos
"This is a beautiful piece. the fabric is a nice weight and the cut of the lace across the shoulders is flattering. the sleeves are dramatic, but not overly fussy. sadly i returned the dress because although it is a swing style (no waistline), it has a very straight cut. i was hoping it was more of an a-line silhouette to accommodate my hips, but alas. if you self-identify as a pear, this may not be the dress for you.",pos
"This blazer is beautiful. it runs tts. it is lightly lined with an off-white poplin. in the body of the jacket, the off-white lining is an adorable swiss dot. though the lining makes the lace portions of the jacket not completely see through, a darker shirt would still show through. the detail is amazing - from the adorable buttons to the variations in the fabric texture. i am 5'5"", and the fit (as far as length) is very similar to what is shown on the model. the sleeves are a little on the long",pos
"I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3"" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium",pos
"On sale this is a great deal. the structure and fit of it are perfect- maybe runs a tad big, but i liked that- it's supposed to be a snug fit, and is, without being too clingy. i chose the berry color and love it- the ribbed style of fabric wasn't as visible in the pic online but i don't mind it in the darker color. can be worn with a bit of flair by unbuttoning the turtleneck or kept classic by not-",pos
Love the color and the design. it is slightly see-through which i don't like but it still works wotb a nude bra. very comfortable!,pos
"I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.",pos
"I love this top it is cute with shorts, capris and jeans. it's really comfortable but looks put together and stylish.  great for running errands to drinks with the girls. a good transition piece into fall with a light cardigan.",pos
"What a great fit! it is casual, but can be dressed up. i could have done the extra small, but the small isn't too big and is still flattering.",pos
"Love this sweater! it is easy to wear and goes well with multiple outfits. it is a great, flexible add to my wardrobe. it fits well, even in the sleeves!",pos
Love these jeans! runs true to size and has a bit of stretch. can uncuff them and have a longer straight jean. very versatile.,pos
"The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears, which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume, the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless, though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid",pos
"I am usually a medium, but sized down to a small for a more fitted look. the light pink is slightly sheer, but will look great over leggings and jeans. i love the detail on the sleeve.",pos
I was eyeing this sweatshirt but didn't want to pay full price- i got it on sale and am so happy i did! it is super soft and comfy. it also fits perfectly- not too baggy but also not form fitting. as a moz fan i couldn't pass it up. awesome sweatshirt!,pos
These pants are fun! i use them as sleep pants. i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort.,pos
"What a perfect dress! it was perfect for a black tie optional wedding. i didn't want another ""black dress"" but when i saw this i knew it was something special! i am 5'5 130lbs and 34dd- the size 8 fit my top better but the size 6 length was better but i decided to stay with the size 8",pos
"Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.",neg
The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy.  it also feels cheap to the touch.  i love the idea but can't keep it for this price...i'm a shorty so i'd have to hem it too! sadly will return.,neg
This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!,pos
Love this dress! really comfortable and flattering. the arm holes are a little big but not too much for me to return the dress or not wear it. love it!,pos
"Love the fabric, print, and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline, but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.",pos
Beautiful design and fit.,pos
"Although seemingly simple, this hooded sweater top is actually versatile. wear with jeans or leggings, even a skirt. wear over a cami, tank or even sleeved top. i do like the delicate nature of this piece and it does appear to be made well enough to be durable. would recommend.",pos
"Really cute and comfortable. i can wear it to work for a casual friday, or out on the weekend. a lot of the sequins are falling off and getting stuck in my dryer!",pos
"This is the most intricate, delicate, beautiful dress i have seen in a long time! the pale blue, coppery brown, and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin, dark hair, and light eyes. unfortunately my normal size was far too snug, especially on my hips, and this is now sold out. the fabric has no give, so i would say with any curves, size up if you can find this beauty. i'm heartbroken to be returning it!",pos
"I love this tank top. i was looking for a mockneck tank for a while, and this totally fit the bill. i wear it to work and out, and feel great in it.",pos
Beautiful skirt! dress up or down! colors are lovely and enable one to wear many different tops. lightweight. perfect for casual or summertime work.,pos
"This runs tts - maybe a little on the large side. i typically wear between a small and a medium (or 6 and 8), and the small was a perfect fit. this is my second jumpsuit and i always worry about how easy they are to pull down for restroom breaks. (i drink a ton of water) this one is relatively easy - it has a button at the back neck that you have to unfasten and it's super easy and not awkward at all. i love how you can dress this up with heels for a night out or pair with sandals for a more cau",pos
"I had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase. love it for fit and graphics - those happy little skiers! i think many reviewers here don't realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style. it's not meant to be tailored for tucking in. if you want to tuck it you'll be wearing a high-waisted skirt or pant, cute also ;-)
rayon fabric is a good choice for the style being heavier than cotton and having a better drape over the chest. the sloping longer hemline toward the",pos
"This jumpsuit is great! i finally found a jumpsuit that works with my longer torso. the fabric is so comfortable and moves with you. i'm planning to pair a thick belt with the jumpsuit over the portion with the tie, just for some added detail while wearing the piece. it's quite easy to get in and out of.",pos
"This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.",neg
"After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter, like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down, the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here, is rava. the length measured at 39"" not the st",neg
"First off, the pictures online hardly do these justice. these pants are way cool. they are soft, have the perfect little pattern, they have a great tie detail on the cuff, they are higher waist (which is always more comfy), and they are super stylish! just like the other reviewer, i am occasionally hesitant on drop crotch pants...but i was so drawn to these. i'm glad i have them a shot because they are way better than i expected! these are worth the buy!",pos
"I love everything about this jacket so much that i had to buy three colors (grey/rust/teal). not only is it figure flattering, it's warm, water repellent, easily layered and well made. the little pop of color contrast added to the stripe seam makes it unique. i would say sizing is tts to a bit large. the only thing that would improve the coat is better finishing of the hems.",pos
"There's no doubt that this tee is sheer. i found that a nude bra is sufficient in overcoming the issue. the fit is true to size, with just enough room for drape without being too oversized. the beachy theme will be perfect come warm weather!",pos
I was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed. i tried it on and i was correct....it looked like i was wearing a huge tent. i returned it.,neg
"Great fit, the fabric is supple and of good quality; has a fasionable look to it but is also very very comfortable. can't beat that!",pos
"The picture does no justice to this stellar piece. its extremely comfortable and looks extremely chic!!! its very 1970's , studio 54 look and ive received tons of compliments!!!! at the price point, its worth it!!!!!",pos
"This jumper is gorgeous! i usually don't instantly spend almost $300 on one piece without contemplating, but as soon as i tried this on, i fell in love. i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big. please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller... i am 5'3"" for reference and even at 5'3"" it's barely short enough to not be too long on me. so if you are an inch or two taller, i would recommend the pe",pos
This is a beautiful jacket. the fabric is soft and drapes wonderful. truly a great addition to any staple in your wardrobe. i am having the sleeves shortened as i prefer a more 3/4 length.,pos
"Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.",pos
"When i first put this dress on, i immediately thought...oh no, i can't pull this off. at least, not without a cow to milk. but this dress is so comfortable. the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price. the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right. (i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen.) fits true to size. i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe",pos
"I'm a big fan of the ""idea of"" jumpsuits and rompers, but so often they go wrong. this one was an unexpected surprise. i'm 5'10"", size 8-10/medium, and the medium fit well and was actually super flattering. the waist is cinched just so that it's very slimming. the roll tab cuff is a cute touch and is probably 2"" higher on me than the model, but adorable none the less. great quality too. love!",pos
"I bought this to wear in the warm climates, when you go indoors it is always freezing. i also travel a lot and wanted something light weight to wear on the plane and airport. wore it the first day all day with jeans and top. lots of compliments. i was worried that driving in the car, it would get torn or snagged. didn't! loved it so much, going to by another one similar and have on again!",pos
"Runs a bit small, but this top is super soft like all the cloth and stone tops. great for all seasons!!",pos
"I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite, one 00. the style, color and cut are all perfect. one not so minor downfall, however. the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot, both during the first time just trying them on. i can't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed. very sad about this.",neg
"This is my kind of clothing item. i love linen, stripes, pockets and a loose look in an over piece. it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat. linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric. i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit. the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style. it does not have any neck closure which may bother some. i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p",pos
"I adore this dress. i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me. it is so easy to throw on and yet it's stylish and flattering- i don't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this. when i bought it, it was knotted on one side in the front. that's the only way i wear it now. it just adds something to it and gives it more shape. i've washed it several times (laid flat to dry) and it has held up well. i'm definitely bookmarking this to buy",pos
"I was really excited about this dress. i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece, casual or dress up. when it arrived in the mail, the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress. unfortunately it hung like that, too. the material sags in places it shouldn't. i have a 5'8"" 125 lb frame, and i ordered an extra small, and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back",neg
"I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric. i'm on the taller side at 5'7"" and found this to fit perfectly, yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room. awesome!",pos
I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it's so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i've washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it's such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there's more of a darker orange tint to it. i've gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it'll come back in the fall in more colors.,pos
Take a look at this dress in person or on instagram. the model photos on this website make it look washed out and bridal. irl the lace is a gorgeous ivory tone that looks great casual and dressed up. i'll be wearing this with leather and denim! i chose the smallest of my size range and it fits very comfortably. if you are busty you may want to size up. i am 135# 36c 38/27/35 and i bought size 8.,pos
I absolutely love this dress. i am 5'0 and 167 pounds and the extra large was way too big. the large was perfect. the fabric is substantial but the fit is loose and swingy so it is good for the atlanta heat and humidity. i want to wear this every day.,pos

"There's something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut. i can't move my arms in this dress. otherwise the fit was fine. the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds. other than that the does nothing for your figure. i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im 107lbs and 5'1"".

"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead.
the neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst",pos

"I was very nervous to buy this top, but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def",pos
"Very very boxy design/cut. try on first or buy knowing you are 90% likely to return. beautiful skirt but if you don't have the right body type/measurements, will not flatter you at all.",neg
"I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium. i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy. i'm tall (5'9"") and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled. it's a very versatile piece. with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater. either look is nice. i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version. also, the fabric doesn't feel thick but it is very insulating and",pos
"The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable. but they are not flattering at all. they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the ""fold over"" portion was not necessary.",neg
"Great, comfy shirt! long enough that i can wear it with leggings!",pos
I got this in the teal and the color is beautiful and i get so many compliments! definitely size down. i am athletic and usually a m and i ordered a small.,pos
"Omg i love this sweater. it is minimalistic yet romantic. my mother in-law bought this for me last may when she was visiting and one for herself. i saw it today at the store in white and i snatched it up. i will wear this for years. i did not see until now that is is meant to be worn with the ties in the back. i've been wearing it with the ties in the front. what a bonus that there are 2 ways to wear this wonderful sweater. i will wear these 2 pieces for many, many years.",pos
Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase!,neg
I love this pajama combo! it is super cute and comfortable!,pos
This sweater is unique and really pretty.  i got so many compliments and i felt really girlie wearing it - it is so fun.,pos
"While this top does fit very loose, it is very cute and can be relaxed or you can dress it up. it is shorter in the front and longer in the back which makes the shirt take on a flattering look. i bought the green color and it is a very rich color, it will be perfect for fall! you may consider ordering a size down if your regular size tends to fit loose.",pos
"Retailer does it again! i'm constantly looking for pieces that will work for a day at the office and then a night out, and this skirt is perfect! you can't really tell in the pictures, but there is a larger slit that separates the grey material from the black, which makes the skirt have more of a statement. it runs true to size and the material is thick enough that it will do great in winter!",pos
"These undergarments are comfortable, streamlined, and well made. this bra holds up well without wires. i am a 34b and wear a small. it is a bit tight at first, but form fits after one wear. . after trying one bra and i ordered 4 more. then i researched the brand and bought camis to match. i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable.",pos
"I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on, it is so big on the bottom, it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.",neg
"I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable, allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!",pos
I bought this in the reddish color. i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on. the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps it's shape. i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as i'm going to wear it a lot.,pos
I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!,neg
"These pants are so great;style,beautiful soft fabric and love the length (i am 5'10""). i found the rise to be low and like the fact that that they sit at the hips. i had to size up from my usual size in this brand. very flattering and comfortable.",pos
"Just picked this up at a store....had a terrible time deciding between the plaid and the chambray but went with the chambray. super soft fabric and not too short for a 55 year old. i'm 5'5"", 135 lbs, and 34 d and the medium is perfect. sometimes i wear a small but have broad shoulders so need the m in this. i'll wear without a belt...it falls nicely and is very flattering!",pos
"This tank is super amazing. very versatile - wore to work with dress pants and flats, and wore out to dinner with jeans and heels. a bit out of my comfort zone since it is a ""swing"" tank, but love the color and cut! perfect for professional life and going out on the town. i did choose a petite in this due to the long armholes (even though i have a long torso for my body size).",pos
"This white blouse is absolutely stunning in person. i wore it with a nude strapless bra. note to self: remove makeup before blouse, otherwise it's all over your blouse.",pos
"I went to the store to try on a jumpsuit and ended up with these instead. while the jumpsuit was really cute, i thought these would be more versatile. as far as i can tell they are the same style as the pradollano tapered loungers by hei hei. these were so cute and comfy i bought both. they can easily be dressed up with a jacket and heels or worn casually with a tee and sandals. i think these are much cuter in person than online. there is a little red design in the pants which is hard to see in",pos
"This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now. soft, fully lined, and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms. the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges.

"It's rare to find clothing made of quality fabrics, and this is a fine, soft wool blend. the design is feminine without being over-the-top, and the fit is slightly loose, as pictured on the model. i would not recommend wearing it with a belt, as pictured; it makes it look too ""trendy"" and detracts from the shape of the cardigan, which is beautiful on its own just skimming the body. it is a perfect topper and can work for daytime or an evening out. really lovely, and one of the few things i decid",pos
Didn't even wait for a sale on this top! so adorable and fits great. i bought a medium and wear a small in most things. i like that it is a touch big as it hangs better that way.,pos
"I like the detail in this cardigan. the shape is true to the fit on the model of the main picture, the sleeves are a bit long, however i am 5'2.5 and 107 lbs, i ordered and kept the xxsp. great staple item!",pos
"I can tell this is will be a ""go to"" shirt this summer. simple lines, yet a little ""different"" style - soft stripes, slits on the side seams and short, but not too short that it bares the stomach. it will look great with jeans, dressier with slim white pants or skirt or a pair of nice shorts. i don't usually go for button-down shirts, but this one was a bit unusual and caught my eye immediately. the fabric is soft yet holds it's shape.",pos
"I love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top. with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok, but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue. also, it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy. overall, a darling top!",pos
"I just purchased this cardigan, it is better in person than the picture. the fit is fabulous, it is very versatile. it can be worn with many different options, definitively be wearing often.",pos
"The shirt was better than it actually looked online. the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it. it's something i can probably fix, just a little disappointed receiving in that shape.

i would recommend this top. very flattering and dressy if you want it to be.",pos
Got this on a whim and boy i'm very pleased! it's flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather. size up as mentioned by other reviewers.,pos
I love love love this top and have received many compliments. if anything it runs small (i wear size 6 and a 36d bra and the s was roomy),pos
Nice print and comfortable shirt.,pos
"I found this top to run very large. i wear a medium in most retailer tops but often a large in other brands, i had to return this for a small. it was worth the effort however, extremely cute top that i can see wearing on its own or under a blazer for a night out.",pos
Love this coat! beautiful pattern and thick enough to keep you warm with a lining inside. i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly in the arms and overall length. i read other comments about the button being too low but i didn't find this to be true. i liked the lower button as it allows you to show some of what you have underneath.,pos
"I was surprised how great this blouse looks on! the color and texture are awesome.... very well made, but runs a tad small. this will be my new go to when i open my closet!",pos
"I love this dress so much, very detailed and comfortable. looks great with the pilcro vest.",pos
"This is a great shirt, fits perfect and super comfortable but you feel stylish and pretty",pos
"I was looking for a comfortable top that looks put-together and cute for work, and this one fits the bill. i couldn't decide between black or white ? so i got both! if i had to choose, i would stick with the black, because it's more slimming, particularly for those of us with a large bust. it's not as heavy or stiff of a material as it appears in the pic, which i like, but it still has structure. great basic with some flair. i got the small (my normal retailer size), and it fit perfectly.",pos
"I love this tee. as others have noted, the ""pink"" is really more of a coral orange, which is what i was hoping for. i wish they had another good color for a redhead because i would buy it.",pos
"This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it, but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...",neg
I love the off the shoulder trend but don't like having to wear a strapless bra so this style caught my eye. it is cute and different and people compliment me on it. swingy but flattering and i got the turquoise but i like it so much i just ordered another one in the black and white stripe.,pos
"I am very petite (5', 96-100 lbs) and find this to be pretty formfitting (not in a bad way) - a rare feat for petites! it is very comfortable - soft, sweater-like material and texture, which does make the dress feel slightly cheap to me, but it doesn't make it look cheap. it's also beautifully patterned in person, pretty true to the online photo, with the only difference being the dress is darker in person, so i don't feel the blue stands out as much as it does on the online photo. the length is",pos
"I love this top! i love the detail in the front and the v back. it's simple and sexy, easy to dress up or wear casually. i ordered an xs and found it to fit perfect, i'm 5'5"" and 112lbs. i ordered the olive green color which i love. i don't typically wear red so that wasn't an option for me, i do wish it came in more colors!",pos
"I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i didn't have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.",pos
I usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small. i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit. pretty but returning.,neg
"Love the design of this denim dress. so unique! i did buy a size larger than i would have normally looked at based on reviews. if on the fence, go up but do get this one. it has no stretch, so a size 8 waist measures 15"" flat, with 17 under the arms. not really for big busted girls. i am 5'8"" and the length is right at lower knee. worth the sale price for sure!!",pos
"Don't pass this one up ladies....the fabric is casual and relaxed, but the drawstring-like collar gives it class and flirt all at the same time. i paired it with a jersey mini skirt and the way the banding at the waist falls on this top made it look like one whole dress. i can wear this with cropped jeans, shorts, anything! truly a homerun. i'm 5'10"", 138lbs and small fit perfectly.",pos
This top came in the mail today and did not disappoint. it feels very light and luxurious and the color is just divine. i got the deep red color and it is beautiful. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my usual small and it fit tts.,pos
"I absolutely love this jacket! i bought it and wore it to work to next day, and received tons of compliments! it is easy to move in as i have ark that required stretching and bending alot. i am 5 5 119 pounds and xs fit a well.",pos
"The color says red but it's more like a rust. i'm 5'3"" so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anything.

finally returned it without it making it out the door :(",neg
Love these lounge pants. i live in florida and was worried they might be too heavy. not the case at all. very soft and lightweight. so comfortable!!!,pos
"Perfect party dress - well constructed, bra hidden at arms and on top, what more can you ask for? i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on. i'm normally a 6, but the 4 (while fitted) looked amazing and didn't pull.",pos
"Awesome pants. they look a lot better in person than in these pictures. i got it in dark blue. they are very comfortable, and can be used day to night. if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option. it's a bit more dressy than other models, still look casual and fun. i may end up getting a couple more for myself...",pos
I purchased this blazer and its so comfortable. it runs small i am usually a size 6 but had to get it in size 8. i will be getting a lot of use out of this blazer. it can be worn professionally with skirt or solid color dress or casual with jeans. the fabric so very soft almost like a sweatshirt.,pos
"Beautiful! caught my eye online. i had to order then reorder in a smaller size, but it is wonderful. colors are beautiful.",pos
This product i better than the pic. nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it,pos

"Great style and the color, can be dressed up or down. i love it!",pos
"Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain, not as displayed.",neg
"This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit, the embroidery, the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!",pos
I bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frame...i'm 5'1. i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly! i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays. would def recommend this dress.,pos
Never would have thought i would love it so much based on the picture online but saw it in person and it's so cute!!  colors are very rich in person - even the soft pink (not a big pink gal) works so well with the other colors.  great quality with full lining.  i lucked out and picked it up for a steal on clearance with another 40% off!  just love it!!,pos
Absolutely stunning dress. true to size and flows like a dream.,pos
"Every year i'm excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses. i love this one, with the longer length, slimming fit and pattern placement, and cozy soft fabric. delightful, inspires reveries of castles and legends (yes i looked up what ""eira"" stands for and went with it). highly recommended. fit is generously tts.",pos
"I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. 
people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.",pos
"I loved this top when i laid eyes on it online, and in person, it did not disappoint. it is a beautiful and unique top. the color is striking and the style is adorable. i can't wait to wear this with some flare jeans and espadrilles.",pos
"It's a very light material, so you can wear it early spring or early fall when it's still fairly warm. such a cute jacket, has no zipper or buttons though, so definitely more for style/look than for a crazy rainy day use! love it!",pos
"This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging, but turned out to be a disappointment. it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips. and the plum color was much darker than i expected, more of a dull brownish-burgundy.",neg
Super simple top that's comfy. i like a looser fit and its boxy- both things i like. seems like it will be a staple piece.,pos
"I have 2 of these now by the same designer. it's comfortable and will be a staple in my closet for summer, early fall and spring. it is a little on the long end but with platform heels, it's perfect.",pos
These are my favourite sleep pants. the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band didn't cut in my sides.,pos
"When i saw this sweater online i honestly didn't think it was really anything special. however, when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color (kind of an off white/ pinkish) i decided to give it a try. i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot. the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft. i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter. glad i decided to give it a try.",pos
"These pants are so soft and super comfy.
they look great with heels and sandals. 
they will be my go to this summer for sure.
would love them in black or navy.",pos
"I saw this in the store and loved the feel of the fabric but did not want to pay full price. i was very happy when it went on sale. the top clings nicely without feeling tight. i got sp (5'5, 125)as i worried the neckline would slip off. fits perfectly. fabric has a very slight sheen. i just hope it holds up to washing and caution is needed as you may create pulls with jewelry if careless.",pos
"Love the material, pockets, length (i wear petitie - i'm 5'3) etc. i usually wear a medium, but this dress runs incredibly large. i was drowning in it and sadly had to return it. size one or two sizes down if you want to purchase!!",pos
This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away..,neg
"Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on. as the other reviews state, it is short and wide. i like the top so much, i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape. otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box :(",neg
"Definitely shorter than expected, but a super light, airy, and comfy dress for summer nights. a must for summer dinner parties!!!",pos
"I absolutely love this dress. it is super soft and flattering for my body type (petite and curvy). though, i wish it did come in petite, as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better. but that didn't stop me from purchasing as that's an easy alteration. very flattering. love it.",pos
This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!,pos
"Love this blouse--looks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made! looks feminine and edgy on. may size out for taller gals b/c it is a bit on the shorter length. i am 5'5"" and the length is just right on me untucked. the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high!",pos
"This is a really nice white button-up top. per usual, the cloth ant stone material is awesome! ... and a machine washable blouse! the side buttons are a really cute feature as well. i found this top fit true to size, and i took my usual xs.",pos
"I stalked the website to get this in a pxxs. it runs a tad large. this is a beautiful garment. i receive many, many compliments every time i wear it. in fact, nearly everyone comments on it. it is surprisingly warm for a cape. i love that it works so well over my bulkier sweaters. as others have mentioned, the buttons are a little difficult, but i found that they got easier with multiple wearings. i disagree with the reviewer that feels the collar must be worn up. i actually like the collar down",pos
"For reference i am 5'5"" and 118 lbs. the small fits nicely. the style is flattering. i have a big rib age, so as with many back zip styles that area is a bit tight when i sit down. not too bad though. ican wear it to work and out for a date both. colors are a bit subdued but i will enhance the pink or blue floral tones with a sweater, jacket and jewelry.",pos
"Love these soft cozy leggings. fit like a glove. perfect for weekends, lounging, sleeping during cold winter weather. want more of the same!",pos
"I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw it!
unfortunately, when i went to put it on, there was a hole running down the seam in the back. i went to store to exchange, wore the shirt, and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt. horrified, i went home, took a look, both holes along the seam! i will be returning this, i really liked this shirt!",neg
"I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly, but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long, which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies, i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom, but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks, making the price tag well worth it.",pos
"I got this sweater in white and i love it. the photo online doesn't do it justice, it's not frumpy at all and looks looks great zipped up because of the slanted zipper. my boyfriend calls it my claire underwood sweater.",pos
"I generally wear a small or medium in tops, and decided to get the medium/large. it's over-sized, but it lays very nicely and doesn't look ""frumpy"". the back of the shirt is exactly as it looks in the picture. the front of the shirt is more of a solid blue than is shown, but still lovely.",pos
Perfect for day at the beach! i'm 5'6 and the length is just right above knee not too short. fresh and cool cotton. comfortable feel.,pos
"I bought this in my usual size small (i'm a 4-6, 27"" waist, 32b), and it fits perfectly. it's a little loose and boxy but still structured and cute (it fits me like the model). i don't find it itchy at all, and the embroidery is just gorgeous. this is perfect for transitioning from summer to fall!",pos
"This shirt was just really missing something for me. i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric, especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse. i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection. however, the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck. i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking. in addition, the bow seemed to be too t",neg
"Just received first pair in brown...love them and ordered two more! these tights actually stay up and you don't have to keep pulling on them throughout the day. super comfortable and perfect weight, not too thick and not too thin. they will run, so be careful when washing or putting them on.",pos
"I'm not really sure what the big to-do about the buttons is all about - i was able to slip the blouse on over my head without undoing any of them with no problems. yes the buttons are difficult, but unless you're breastfeeding, they shouldn't be a deal breaker! the blouse is exactly what i was expecting. so pretty, feminine and flattering. also, though it is a tiny bit sheer, i plan to wear it with a nude bra and no cami.",pos
"This coat is beautifully tailored and made in the usa of 100% wool the color is vibrant. it looks great when you need a longer coat for the cold. it's almost an outfit on its own. lastly, the size was perfect. i ordered my normal 8 and it fit like a glove.",pos
Loved it. i have receive so many compliments when i wear this. it fit great.,pos
"Love this skirt! the material is so soft and flowy, but holds a nice a-line shape. i do agree with the other reviewers that this does run a bit small. i am a 26"" waist and purchased a 4... and i could probably have considered sizing up to the 6 easily as well.",pos
"I absolutely love this dress! i purchased it in my usual size 2 petite and it looks as though it was made for me. the combination of the placement of the pattern and the cut of the dress was quite figure flattering. the only tiny issues i had were that the dress fell to the middle of my kneecaps and may need a hem; in addition, the dress takes a bit of maneuvering to get into due to the side zipper and the close fit. despite these issues, i feel that it is definitely worth buying and i will be k",pos
"I love this dress, it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me. i am not the tallest person, 5'4"" but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing. perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me, but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast. it's just something to be aware of. i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess.",pos
"Since there was only one review on this i thought i would chime in. i had been eyeing this for months and was able to get it on sale which was a plus since this had a pretty hefty price tag to start. that being said, the tailoring and detail work on it is just beautiful. i am a little worried about how the knit will wear but not worried enough to return it! as far as sizing goes, i ordered a 4 in the last byron lars dress and i am a 4 in this too. it fits snugly, but a 6 would have looked lumpy",pos
I bought this in size xl in the moss color. it fits true to size. it's very comfortable--the fabric is soft. i love the draping of this top. i'm a pear-shape and this type of cut is my favorite. the moss color looks black online but is really a dark forest green. i'd love to see this top made in other colors.,pos
"This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it, even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress, which i feel this is. once i tried it on, i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point, an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft, comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!",neg
Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.,pos
"Nice quality, soft fabric, sleeves definitely make a unique statement. the fit worked for me, although it could have more room in hips (for my hourglass figure). got m, size l was way too big. i am 34d, but the dress can definitely accomodate bigger chest. the color are my favorites in this season.
wear it to stand out!",pos
"I think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years, and this might be my new favorite. one major improvement over years past is the fit...it really is true to size, rather than running large as has been the case in the past. the material is a substantial, stretchy jersey with a nice texture. the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means it's not sheer at all, and it also a nice smooth fit, skimming over less-than-perfect areas. i also really appreciate",pos
"I purchased this romper over a month ago and love it! i ordered a s and would say that it is true to size. it falls well and i love the blousy look on top. it is expensive at full price, but i purchased it with a promotional discount. luckily, before i washed this (as the tag says handwash only), i read the reviews in which some reviewers had said that they followed the directions and it still shrunk. i let it sit in my hamper until today after i read online about using dryel and rayon. dryel in",pos
"I wanted to love this shirt so much! i got this as a gift for christmas in the black. the first time i wore the shirt 3 of the buttons on the back fell off. keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together. needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back. retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem, but i wanted to give the fair warning!",neg
"I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up, i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it, a slight sheen, and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be, but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor",pos
"This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute.",neg
"This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost, but i would just wear a bra of the same color and don't think anyone would notice.  i didn't buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee, in my opinion.",pos
"I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on, is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.",pos
"I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.",neg
"Perfect cozy sweater, nice details. exactly what i wanted to upgrade from sweatshirts.",pos
"I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned.",neg
"I love these shorts, nice material, good fitting, and great look. i sized up, usually an 8 and i ordered a 10 based on others reviews and it was the right choice. these are a great casual short or dressed up with shoes and a nice shirt.",pos

"Bought this dress based on the other reviews and was glad i did. fabric is very nice and soft. it drapes nicely, hiding my tummy trouble area. very flattering and not too short, i could wear it with a blazer to work and also out on a date night. happy with my purchase.",pos
These tailored front flowy back tops don't always work. this is long enough to wear with leggings and quite flattering,pos
I am usually a size o and ordered and xs ...due to the band in the center (not much give) it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part. that being said the cup design is a hot mess. i am a b/c cup size and the top on this could not handle it. i felt fully exposed. i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage. the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small. i still felt to exposed. they are,neg
"I love retailer sweaters, in fact, i believe all my sweaters are from retailer! this cardigan is really nice and i'm so glad i bought it. it will work well with skirts, dresses, pants... it's well made and soft and comfy. highly recommended!",pos
This is not your basic white tee. the ruffle and seam down the front add visual interest. cute alone or paired with a sweater and statement necklace.,pos
Gave this sweater to my mom this christmas and she has hardly taken it off...so cozy and cute!,pos
"I am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it. i am 5'5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses. i would normally buy a small, but sized down to an xs and it was perfect! it's a beautiful dress and very flattering!",pos
"I fell in love with this dress online and ordered it despite some of the reviews that claimed it cut too high in the leg and couldn't be worn as a dress. i thought it was lovely enough to wear as a long shirt even if that was the case. however, when it arrived  the side hems were not cut too high for me and i have successfully worn it as a dress (receiving many compliments along the way). i'm 5'2 (and a quarter) inches, 117lbs. i ordered an extra small and it fits perfectly. the fabric is soft a",pos
"I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall, in order to see which was the best fit. i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online - like it had a nice flow, the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have. i was really disappointed, the sweater doesn't flow like it does in the picture - it kind of billows out in the front and back and isn't flattering. i have a small build, and, frankly, i usually look good in sweaters",neg
"Saw this in store today and had to have it. the pink is a really bright pink - definitely more of a hot pink than it appears in the image online. i am a solid 10, and i bought this in an 8, so it definitely runs a size large. highly recommend!",pos
"Such a cute dress, i ordered the black version. i'm large busted (dd) and the slip thankfully fit (sometimes it doesn't). i'm 5' 4"" and went ahead with the regular, not petite, version and i have to say i think the petite would have been too short. the dress comes to the top of my knees as photographed on the model. highly recommend.",pos

beautifully. 
they're a fairly narrow (cropped) leg, with a slight flare. i'm happy and ordering another pair.",pos
"This is such a beautiful shirt! for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34b) it is a very detailed and tailored shirt so i can understand if your busty why you may have to size up. the attention to detail along with the embroidered butterflies sets this shirt a step above average. the color is an odd shade of olive but i like it and the butterflies have areas that you can see through but not in an im-modest way. i do not feel the need to wear anything under it.",pos
Beautiful dress. the details are lovely. it feels a little bit like a nightgown. i always wear a slip. bust does run a little small so i unbutton the first few buttons. armholes feel a little small also.,pos
"I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect.",pos
"Love this shirt- i got the white/yellow one and with a pair of dark jeans and booties i was ready for anything. i have an hourglass type figure, and sometimes with flowy shirts that is hidden. but this shirt somehow subtly emphasized that in an attractive way!",pos
"Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small, sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.",pos
"I was really disappointed with these pants. they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch. they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist. sadly, they will be going back.",neg
Love this dress! it's so soft & not to short like some retailer dresses. great transition piece! i'm a fan of bell sleeves & can't wait to wear this with boots& tights this fall.,pos

"Just picked up this cardigan in the heather charcoal - so i can wear it in the fall and winter. the design on the border is well done and will show off whatever you wear under this cardi. sleeves are snug and long, but can easily be pushed up to 3/4 length.",pos
Loved this top. great design. comfortable and unique. soft material,pos
"This initially caught my eye online and then i immediately tried it on when our store received it. the dress is simple and well structured with a tight sweater weave that almost has a"" hold u in"" feel. therefore, it fits like a glove on!!",pos
"Love this top. purchased in a size medium, my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely. wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants. i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top. purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more. will be great in spring and summer, cooler days in summer.",pos
"This top is an amazing go to piece, and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto. i will say, that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear. therefore, it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time. good staple for a great price.",pos
Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.,neg
"I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband. and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up. the cut is a disaster, the quality is terrible, and the dress just plain didn't work. the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly, giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one non-existent breast. the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi",neg
"This maxi is perfect! the neckline is sexy but not too sexy (yay for normal bra!), and the waistline is flattering. the skirt isn't very full, but the ruffle effect at the bottom gives it nice movement. it could easily be dressed up or dressed down. i can't imagine that this wouldn't be flattering on anyone. it fit totally true to size for me.",pos
"Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it's not heavy, it's weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.",pos
"This too is easy to wear, skins the body nicely & the color is very pretty. some of the retailer tops have issues for me because i find the necklines too low. not this one. the placket lays flat & doesn't expose excessive cleavage. the details on the blouse are pretty & subtle. the top washed well in the delicate cute. just hang it to dry and it looks great!",pos
"I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket, and the removable collar gives even more versatility. i am short so i opted for regular xs (i'm 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight. i love military green color, it's a happier neutral than black or brown. without saying, it goes with everything and flatters all body types.",pos
"These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes, i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these.",pos
"I love this top, it is a cool style mix between mensware and women's. the collar is gorgeous, making it feminine and beautiful. i normally wear a size large in retailer, i would size down. returning my large for a medium. a beautiful shirt for many occasions.",pos
I love this vest! it's perfect for day and dress up for the evening. very comfy!,pos
I sized down in this and it fit perfectly! i normally opt for petite in skirts but i stuck to regular for this skirt and it was much more flattering . adorable and well made!,pos
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.,pos
"This cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks. i love the fit of the small (5''3"" and small/medium build). would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home.",pos
"I love this dress. the fit is spectacular and if there were any problems with the hook and eyes in the front coming undone as stated in previous reviews, it has been corrected! the dress does not come undone and it moves beautifully with you walking, sitting and bending. i wore this to a holiday party and the color is just amazing! a coppery and brown/gold pattern. very flattering! i will purchase more byron lars dresses for certain!",pos
"It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable, but the picture for this product is very deceiving! it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page, but it is considerably short. i am nearly six foot tall, but thought by this picture it would be lengthy, not at all!
it is a beautiful sweater, might work better for a shorter stature.",neg
I wanted to add my two cents because i was worried when ordering the pants from previous reviews that they would be to tight as it had been suggested they run small. i didn't find that to be the case and think they run true to size,pos
Love the bright colors! made really well!! super soft and vibrant!,pos
"This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit, length, and color. the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy - feels soft like a boucle type knit. the sleeves are 3/4 length and the weight is maybe a medium-weight (not super warm). i wouldn't see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter, but for right now it's perfect!! fit is tts :)",pos
I absolutely love this piece. it's a beautiful and chic piece that is perfect for any occasion,pos
"These shorts work well for shopping, running errands, or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers. they are not too short and are true to size.",pos
I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!,pos
"These pants are beautiful. great fit and great fabric. really comfortable and elegant. i am tall 5'8"" and have a long torso so it's nice to find pants that are high waisted.",pos
"Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3"" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip, but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price.",neg
"When i spotted these online i knew i had to try them out! in the past charlie pants have always been too baggy in the legs for me when trying the regular sizes on in the store. well, these are described as 'slim, tailored' in details, so decided to order my usual size 6 regular. upon arrival, they were baggy in the thigh area, the rise was fine but the crotch area -pardon me- was a little on the short side. buttons were difficult to slip into the buttonhole & unbuttoning was a job! guess the hol",pos
"I feel like an indian princess in this dress! it isn't very forgiving, make sure you don't mind showing some skin - but there's some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times. great colors; boyfriend loves it.",pos
"The is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee. i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty. i'm 5'1 ,103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size. it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist. love this and the price!",pos
"When this arrived in the mail, i knew there was a 50/50 chance of a sheath dress working with my body-type (athletic on top, larger on bottom). i usually wear size 6 in a-line dresses, and i found this dress, size 6, in the sale room, and barely squeezed in. ordered size 10 and love it.

"I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color, size l (my usual size, i'm 5'8"" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy, but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase.",pos

"Love tiny. i am 5'7"", 125-128 lbs depending on the day, and a 34a. i also have a very long torso, and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me. this one, however, was a huge miss. i ordered online in my usual tiny xs. it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated, so it looked boxy on me. however, the worst part was the placket. the description doesn't note that it's held together with a tiny snap. that snap takes nothing to undo, and then",neg
"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)",neg
"The colors are amazing. so vibrant and plentiful. the arm holes are fairly generous but not bad. i think it just adds to the loose fitting nature of the dress. i got a medium.. i'm 170 with a small chest. medium is my norm for maeve. the buttons in the back are difficult, you need help getting on, but getting off you can do solo. this dress makes your shoulders look really good!! it sits in a very flattering way.",pos

"You have to give this dress a try - yes, it runs small - i'm usually a 4 in retailer dresses. / 32dd 5'5"" 130lb - i couldn't button the top button with my bra on but i could without it on - it fit perfect every where else. it is very flattering in every way. it's 100% cotton, lightweight, and soft. the flare does not have too much fabric and is actually slimming unlike other fit and flare dresses. the sz 6 fit more comfortable and i could wear my bra which looked better and gave my breasts a lift",pos
"This is another one of those darned swing tops. i can't even with this trend. this shirt has such a nice print/color palette going on but it's ruined by the swing cut/henley combo- it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized men's night shirt/smock? i don't know, it was just not at all flattering. i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut. i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes.. this just made my",neg
"Really cute top, normally order a s or xs. based on reviews, i ordered a m and good fit.",pos
I love these so very much! by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer. i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them. they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull off....but very tastefully do. i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve t-shirt. worth every penny. if your size is available grab them...you will be happy you did.,pos
"Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months, but fit & feel great. love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for ""active"" wear.",pos
"I am not sure who in the world could really wear this as a dress without belting it...definitely a super weird cut. extreme a-frame. the fabric is just absolutely gorgeous and it is so well made otherwise. i thought about trying to size down but it would be too small in the shoulders for sure. i am going to keep anyway. i've already worn it with jeans and a t-shirt and as a topper with a denim shirt dress. it actually looked fantastic with both. i'll get a lot of wear out of it, just not the way",pos
"This tunic has nice, soft fabric and nicely done embroidery that make it stand out. it's comfortable and the fabric is very nice, but it is not flannel as advertised. the tunic is made out of a double-gauze cotton, which is a great fabric with a casual look.",pos
"This kimono is absolutely wonderful. i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation, but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather! goes with pretty much everything. highly recommend.",pos
This skirt is shimmery without being too much. rich colors and perfect fit tts nice elastic middle so comfortable and gorgeous.,pos
I purchased this top as a swim suit cover-up and it is perfect! i was counting on the model in the photo being tall so that the top would be longer on me and that was true. great product.,pos
"This top is great! it looks much better in person. it's still kind of a faded look but it's not as light as shown here. also, the exact location of the plaid is different on each top. it runs just a tiny bit large but i liked it loose so took my normal size. there is another fabric lining the front in a very cute print. will be a nice, loose and cool top for summer. love the tie in the back as well.",pos
This pjs are adorable!! they run tts and are extremely comfortable!,pos
I ordered online. i sized up one size. it fit perfect. so flattering and so pretty. then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuck...badly. 30 minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back. the zipper is that awful.,neg
I bought the red and it is gorgeous. i love how it hangs - heavy but fluid. i usually wear a 4 but i bought a 6 and it was perfect.,pos
"I wore this unbuttoned with a moss green tla tank top, faded, ripped, rolled up stevies with gladiator sandals and turquoise jewelry and it looked great. this is an amazing piece for your summer wardrobe that can be worn so many ways.",pos
Wore it to a cousins wedding. loved it! probably one of the best dresses that i have ever worn. lots of compliments. felt great dancing the night away.,pos
"While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!",pos
"I ordered this in grey first but didn't care for the black lace ---- so, decided to try the cream/beige/neutral and i just love it. i have areas i am trying to ""cover up"" and this really fits the bill without looking too much like an oversized tunic. the back is the clincher. different and surprising. washes excellently, but i did line dry as i was afraid of shrinkage. if there are any left you won't be sorry and the neutral color looks good on almost everyone!",pos
"I'm about 5'5"" and normally about 120 lbs so i purchased the small. i'm currently 9 months prego, but i couldn't resist this jacket! i purchased anyway and although it doesn't fit over my belly right now, i'm looking forward to being able to wear it soon! it will be perfect for the chilly office or a casual day. the fabric is beautiful with just the right amount of stretch. like others have said, it has a bit of a navy-ish tint to to it, so it's not truly black. thanks retailer for offering anothe",pos
"I like the warm neutral color of this piece and the figure-skimming shape with waist definition. it is a soft and warm layering piece. sadly, the sleeves were too long for me and have long zippers at the cuffs so rolling them up didn't work. i wish i had caught this piece while they still had my size in petite!",pos
I love simplicity in clothing and this tee fits the bill! i put it on and instantly feel basic elegance.,pos
"I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt",neg

"This is a lovely sweater - the ""moss"" color however is really camel, which is what the photo indicates. it fits tts, is all cashmere, and is knit in a brioche stitch that gives it loft and texture that can be seen well in the detail photo. i am generally not a fan of raglan sleeves but in this case it works with the overall construction of the sweater - one that features interesting decreases, lines, and angles. it is very soft, warm, and lightweight, and can be worn as a casual piece or dressed",pos
"Love this top! the quality is great and the pattern is even cuter in person. i'm 5'4"", 125 lbs and bought my normal size s which fits perfectly. it's pretty flouncy and roomy, which is nice because it hides my post-baby tummy. especially love how the back covers my bottom which means i can wear my skinny black leggings underneath. definitely recommend!",pos
"I love the paisley print, very soft and comfy, flutter sleeve look is cute,perfect weekend wear.",pos
This is a great summer top! love the way it drapes and the quality of the material. bought the ivory and went back for the rust but my size is sold out. my only complaint is that it doesn't come in way more colors!,pos
"I love these socks so much! i ordered the beige and red pair with the polar bear design and they are my new favorite socks. these are comfy, with great stretch and just the right amount of cushion. however, the best feature is the cute little frill around the cuff! i want to order more, but i don't care for the other designs as much as the pair i ordered. instead, i will be keeping an eye on this brand to see what they come out with next!",pos
Love this dress in the orange print! i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersome--it is! but i'm willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress. and it is adorable! easy and comfortable to wear--and i just love the orange pattern print! took my usual size!,pos
"This blouse is a perfect creation: perfect-weight cotton, many, many details, and color, all perfectly executed. there's fullness to the body, so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot, humid locations this summer, and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look. there's no mistaking quality when you look at this piece! i bought the medium for my 130#, 34f, size 8 blouse/tee frame. this is the blouse you will have for years, and you will enjoy",pos
"I'm stunned by the bad reviews by others. i love this dress! it is an amazing, feminine, detailed, exceptional work of art, and lucky for me -- who usually takes 14s and 16s -- that it runs big. there is stretch to it, and it fits great! lucky, lucky me.",pos
"This skirt is great and you can't beat it for the price. it fits more like a pencil skirt on me, and looks sort of a-line on the model. very nice work appropriate skirt. though the slit comes higher than i expected. my thighs are tattooed so i put on some black tights and it looks great with a blouse and cardigan!",pos
"It's embarrassing to admit but i am buying this top for the second time because i've misplaced the first one and i fear that if i wait too long trying to recover it that it will be a sold out item and i'll never be able to have it again... hence the decision to repurchase. i just love it that much. i'm sure that now that i have the second top the first one will mysteriously show up, lol!

anyway, this top is a very flattering off the shoulder style. one of the things i really like about it is",pos
"I was really excited to get this top in the mail; unlike other reviewers, i didn't find that the top fit small, but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didn't look good with the billow-y torso of the top. i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls, but i'm very tall and broad shouldered, so it didn't look as good on me.",neg
"This is a beautiful sweater. the photo doesn't do it justice. the model is wearing too large a size. i wear a l in moth and definitely looked better in the medium. the price is too high but the 25% savings thanksgiving weekend helps to blunt the pain. the lining is soft but was wrinkled on all the sweaters. the coloring is very flattering and, with care, this should be able to be worn for years. it can be used as a dressy coat sweater or fabulous over casual clothes. i wasn' particularly impress",pos
"Normally i like to purchase from the store so i can try things on first, but this top wasn't available locally. i guessed on a medium. i'm 5'5"" and very curvy and the medium fits just like the picture on the model. just a hint of a sleeve and nice and drapey-loose over the body. the embroidery is just beautiful. the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars for quality is that i had to sew two buttons onto the back, my top came without them.",pos
"This swimsuit is amazing! i am 5' 4"" and about 135 lbs, and ordered a small. however, i am returning it for an extra small (just a personal preference as i like my swimsuits a bit snug so they don't get loose when wet). the fabric is very forgiving and stretchy (which is why i'm exchanging for a smaller size - i can slide the size small up my legs with ease), but the fabric is also very sturdy (so it seems, i haven't worn it in the water yet obviously). overall, very cute and surprisingly flatte",pos

Want to combine super comfort with super style and quality!! stop here and buy these!!!! you will not be disappointed!!!,pos
"I absolutely love this blouse! it's easily one of my favorite retailer finds in several seasons. it is quite roomy, so anyone hoping for a more form fitting cut won't find it here. this is the type of fit i prefer for summer though, as missouri is just disgustingly humid and i can't stand to wear anything clingy once it heats up. it's sheer, so a cami is required. it's also wrinkle prone, but the fabric is almost like a gauze and is not meant to be perfectly pressed and crisp. it's perfect to thro",pos

"For the sale price, this is an amazing deal. i tried the white version of this shirt on in a size 10 because, being on sale, that was all they had available in the store. it was unfortunately too large with the 'v' of the shirt plunging rather low and the sleeves hanging off my shoulders, and i didn't buy it. when i came back a few days later, i found this in a size 6 in black. i honestly don't know my shirt size in numbers, but i'd consider this one a small to medium so i'd say it's fairly true",pos
I really liked this tank. i purchased it in the green. i went with my regular size 2. yes it's boxy but it's a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer. i'm planning on using it on our vacation to the beach . it is thin and soft.,pos
"These are nice dusty rose pants. they have a great textured design on them. they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch! i will say they are not soft like sweatpants, definitely feel like a poly-blend but the look makes up for it. the material is a little on the thin side and they are not lined....but not see-through either.",pos
"This top is so beautiful and well made, and the detailing in the back is gorgeous. it's unexpected and makes this piece really special. it does run a tiny bit large; i've gotten retailer chambray a before, and they usually shrink a touch in the wash and then for just right. i haven't washed this yet, but even a little large it fits well and hangs nicely without being overly baggy. get this, you won't regret it!",pos
"I saw this dress in my local retailer store and had to try it on. i cannot say enough good things about this dress! i love it!
 like other reviewers said it runs very big. i am 5'8"" 138 pounds and usually wear a size 6 but got this in a 2. fits like a shirt dress should once i sized down.",pos
Love this top!! perfect date night top! you can dress it up with a cute pair of heels or wear it around doing errands in some flats.,pos
"I bought this to wear to holiday parties, but it would work for any special occasion. the embroidery is gorgeous and really pops on the black background. the dress itself is a brushed cotton that is thick enough to not to show every bulge. i said it runs tts. i bought the size 2 and normally would wear a 2 or 4 in retailer dresses. the dress is fitted through the torso and flairs at the hips, so you may want to size up or down depending on your body type.. i did not have any issue with the armhole",pos

"First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person (which i personally love over the tan). i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas, but they are holding up and not stretching out. there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket. overall, if you're considering this jacket, take the plunge like i did. order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if you're hoping to layer.",pos
I was excited to try this dress on in person and so glad i did. it's actually really cute. the material is soft and super comfortable. the dress hits just above the knee and the tie in the front accentuates your waist. i was pleasantly surprised at how cute it really is. i'm excited to wear this to work! worth the price.,pos
Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats- the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight. the coat has an odd shape - not a line or straight. the medium was large on me. the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges. sadly this coat will be returned.,neg
"I love this tee. i am long waisted and so many tops right now that are on the shorter side look silly on me so i was happy to find this. i'm 5' 5"" 118, 34b and bought and xs. it fits perfectly. the asymmetry is darling and the stripes are perfect for spring. it is a nice weight and i felt totally worth the money. it looks great so far after three washes and hang dries.",pos
This is better than the original tla t shirts from last summer. better quality/not sheer. great fit! i bought both the white and the purple. love tla tees!,pos
These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.,pos
"Love this top! simple, yet so stylish.",pos
"This is just the perfect sweater in my opinion. i got it in the rose, which is a gorgeous subtle color that will go with just about anything. i love the knit pattern and the buttons, and the sleeves are nice and long, which is crucial for me at my height (5'11""). overall i just see myself throwing this on over everything, so i'm sure i will treasure this for years to come!",pos
"This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small, i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely.",pos
"Soft very forgiving and flattering top, wish it was not so pricey",pos
"Love this so much because it's so soft, pliable and fits wonderfully with all of my fall wardrobe.  i ordered the plum color, which looks brown to me.  was advised to size up and glad i did.  i bought large petite and my stats are 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35.",pos
"I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges. but, the first thing that set me off was the color and the material. the color is more street sign yellow than a soft, warm yellow. the fabric is a thin, sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper. i was anticipating a thicker shirt-like fabric. when i tried it on, i liked the idea, but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costume...or a parachute. i will defin",neg
"I bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week, but it's cut way too large that i felt like a football player. this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame. also, the cut is way too big. i was swimming in this.",neg
"This is way shinier in person than i expected, but i like it. there are gold threads throughout which stand out. i love shiny things so i was pleasantly surprised. i agree that you could size down if you wanted, but it looks cute roomy and loose i think. really soft. i will wear this to the park or dressed up for dinner. love the double duty aspect. i'm a little bummed about the fabric content, but that's it.",pos
"I ordered 3 different styles of jogger pants and these were definitely the ones to keep! true to size and instantly comfortable due to the soft material they are made from. the taupe color i got will go with a lot, too. these are great pants that you won't be sorry you bought!",pos
"Unfortunately, this dress did not work for me like the other reviews. i am 5'8, 130lbs, and the dress looked like a tent on me (size s). there was just way too much material at the bottom. also, while the dress is lined, both layers are quite thin- not see through, but i would not call them substantial either. for the cost of the dress and the material, it wasn't worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better.",neg
Beautiful blouse - the material is great. long enough to wear over leggings but i've also worn with my flare jeans. somewhat fitted at the top and then drapes out in a gorgeous way. one of my new favorites.,pos
"I was really looking forward to these tees working, after reading the reviews. unfortunately, they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans. trying to keep it age appropriate.",neg
"This will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim, nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily, but i will deal",pos
"This is not only comfortable but incredibly flattering. being 6'0"" it's also long enough for me.",pos
"I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected, but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles, especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable, and if you are large chested, i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh",pos
"This is the perfect top. it is adorable, and the fit and cut of it is forgiving.",pos
"I purchased this in both the black and the turquoise and wish they made more colors! this top is perfect for our florida 90 degree weather! i am usually a medium in tops (size 6-8), broad shoulders, size 36c and i purchased this in a 6p and a 6 (as they were out of petite in turquoise). i do prefer the 6p as i am 5'2"". i would say this runs generous as there is ample room to move. i wear mine with a nude bra on the turquoise top and the bra straps show a bit, but they are almost covered by the s",pos
"I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd, i  just couldn't make it work on my body.",neg
Saw this hanging in the store. it is cute front and back.  it is flattering as well. i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night.  looks amazing with a denim jacket,pos
"I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened, i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece",pos
"I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3"", +/- 105 lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics, so that may vary a bit. however, the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash, but sometimes that's worth it.",pos
"I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin. i was expecting higher quality, especially for the price. i was disappointed. it is a pretty dress and fit great, but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper.",neg
"I love everything about this tee. it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees. the fabric is soft, and the tee is very comfortable. i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors. i actually love both colors. the red is a nice slightly brownish red. i wore that color with a pair of plaid (white, teal, & taupe) shorts, and i got compliments on my outfit. the color will go with more than one might think. i haven't worn the green one yet. i hope this tee comes bac",pos
"This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!
i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.
the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.",neg
"I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c, bought the 0. there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model. 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric.

unlike another reviewer, i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer. wi",pos
Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.,neg
"This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i",pos
"This dress is extremely comfortable and looks great on. i'm 5'3"" and 34dd and the m petite fit like a dream with even a bit of room at the bust. the length is perfect with sandals or even up to 2-inch heels. perfect for travel and summer entertaining!",pos
"I ordered this in my usual size small (36b bust, 5'5"", around 116 lbs), but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn't cinch in at the waist at all, rather bubbled out a bit. the tunic ""flaps"" laid strangely as well, like they were too small almost. the high cut sides were indeed high cut...showing the waistband of my leggings. apparently that is a new style, as i have seen a few other tops like it around, but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on",neg
"Unique and well-made skirt, sure to turn heads.  embroidery is lovely.  def a statement piece for any wardrobe.",pos
"Even in my usual petite small size, this looked bulky and made me look stumpy. disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality. i don't even know if going down a size would have helped. as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe.",neg
"Pilcros always fit perfectly and these jeans are no different. the style is great and a little different with the slits on the side. i bought the gold color which is a little brighter than pictured. for that reason, i'm on the fence about keeping them. i wish there were other bold colors to choose from since most of the other choices seem washed out.",pos
One of the most beautiful sweaters i've ever seen. i love it!,pos
This vest is great. i'm wearing with my red striped turtleneck dress i got on sale here. i can see this going with so many outfits. mainly those dresses that might feel a little tight around butt and hip area- this will cover it all. worth full price imo. tts. i'm a 10 and this in m is perfect.,pos
"I bought one of these tees for myself and one as a gift -- both in green, which is really a beautiful dark teal color (as pictured). the fabric is so soft that the gift recipient said she wanted ""an entire jumpsuit made of this fabric."" :) the shirt is long enough, loose enough and substantial enough to wear untucked, as pictured, but lightweight enough to tuck in to a pencil skirt. i am usually an xs or an s in tops, and i ordered the s in this one. the larger size gives the slightly loose fit",pos
"I love ag stevie cords! i'm 5'4 and pear-shaped and the 26p fit great, the length and mid-rise are perfect! very comfortable and can be dressed up for casual work environment or down for weekend. the material is a bit thinner and not as soft as versions from previous years but still very nice and perhaps more versatile. wish petite had more color options.",pos
"I bought this duster in the blue color and really like it. i am 5'11"" so love the longer length. the large was too wide so got the medium. the sleeves were a little snug on my upper arms but after wearing it for awhile they loosened up. i think i will get the white too!",pos
"I wore these pants for the first time yesterday to two parties. before anyone asked for my name, they complimented me on the pants. my husband loved it, my friends loved it, and people i didn't know loved it. it's worth every penny i paid for it. i bought these pant to bring on my trip to italy later this summer.",pos
"This dress is way prettier in person than online. fits like a glove. a little tight up top as are most side zips. i did not have to size up, however.",pos
I ordered the floral blue dress. i am a size 8-10 and ordered the medium. it did not find that it was large on top as others had mention. i love the smoking but would also look great with a belt and boots. it makes a great all weather dress.,pos
"I have a closet full of dresses and very few have the quality and attention to detail as this gorgeous dress!
often times when ordering online the dress that you actually receive will have a different fabric placement than the online photos.......and it can detract from the overall look.....but the one that i received is exactly as pictured. the gold details hit in all the right places.
the quality is shocking! looks like a $2000 dress.
true to size however, the chest/bust runs a little big.",pos
Very comfortable and looks really good on me. that's very important!,pos
"This shirt is very soft and fits nicely. as with a lot of maeve tops, the arms are a little snug so if you have muscular arms you'll definitely want to size up. it won't make the shirt too ""blousey"" because it will still look really cute tucked in in the front with ankle jeans and a trendy belt. i wish i had gotten this in the blue before it sold out because it is lovely!",pos
"I'm 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34c and the xs fit perfectly. very soft, feminine top. i got many compliments the first day i wore it. wire it for business casual, but looking forward to wearing it with flare jeans for a more 70's look. highly recommend this great sale on a wonderful top.",pos
"I am 5'3"", 130b, small waist, wide hips. dress fits perfectly, a little longer than i had expected (hits about mid-calf on me). great quality corduroy, nice medium green color. very unique, sort of vintage feel piece.",pos
"I bought this online because i love the print on the dress and i was not disappointed. it is gorgeous! the waist on the dress is much looser than in the picture, but i am fine with that. i am 5'9"" and the dress length is accurate as shown in the picture.",pos
I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.,neg
"I love boiled wool paired with classic silhouettes and this bonette combines best of both. the fabric is soft, not too substantial but still warm for my climate, goes great with many outfit combinations, has a flexible cut for my body type. i chose to to buy the size small and while it's a little tight in the upper sleeves (because my upper arms are chubby) i can work with it when i wear the right top. the medium was a just a bit too boxy for the profile i wanted but i may get it any way in the",pos
"I love this top, the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely, both front and back. it's also very comfortable and soft, allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft tee-shirt. the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up. sadly, it's sold out in in my size online and in the stores, otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price.",pos
So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.,neg
"Was not expecting to like this - tried on and super cute, comfy relaxed fit. looked good with leggings i had on but color will be great with jeans too. will wear both unzipped and zipped.",pos
"These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops. 

the fabric is nice and sturdy. the colors are more vibrant than online. 

the design however is terrible. when i put them on i double checked to make sure they weren't on backwards- the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets. the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a ""1920s circus diaper"" look which is not good. 

they're also really tight compar",neg
"These are great pants. i was nervous because when i saw them at the store they looked pretty linty but after wearing them a number of times they are not bad. i have to run a lint roller over them occasionally but not more than other black pants. i wear these to work and they are very comfortable. kind of stretchy, but very flattering. the higher rise than the other stevies makes them work really well for work-allows them to look less ""jean"" like. i highly recommend these-can't believe they aren'",pos
"Ordered a size 0, my usual at retailer... very flattering, fits well",pos
"This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.",pos
"I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.",pos
"I really liked the casual style of this top, but i was disappointed when i put it on.  it's cut weird- the shoulder cut-outs are smaller than pictured and just don't seem to hang right.  they don't hit where they're supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured, more like 3/4 which i didn't like.  the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off.  i tried xs and s.  both fit weird.",neg
"The dress is really frumpy standing up. something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy maw-maw nightgown. the lace is really pretty, though",neg
"Runs large in arm holes. have to wear bandeau. love this print and flow of dress. loose but still flattering due to arms and shoulders . love the overall look. midi length for this 5'6.5"" gal. size s worked best -36c-125lbs",pos
"This sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece! i think it can be easily dressed up and down. the quality is quite nice and should hold up over time.

the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit. i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts. but honestly, i tried the medium as well, and it was much different... just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired. for reference,",pos
"I bought this skirt in the store a few months ago, because i anticipated that retailer would sell out of my size considering how great the fit/look of this skirt is. sure enough, they've sold out of the size 2. normally i wear a size 4, sometimes 6, in skirts depending on the cut and where it's from; just last year i bought a skirt from retailer in a size 10! for me, this was a skirt i needed to try on to get the perfect size, but it's absolutely adorable and a great deal at the sale price! it's mod",pos
"For my 5'9"", 36 c bust, hourglass frame, and 170 lbs, i got the medium and found it fit well. a bit snug but i didn't want to go to large and have it too loose at the top. my thoughts below:
__________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfortable due to being part modal.
- the pleating on either side on the shoulders just drapes so lovely with the cowlneck. it just gives it an edgy look that i really like.
- this ""grey"" has actually a minuscule houndstooth-like or checkboard-like appearance that's ha",pos
"The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice. they are a very rich green and pink, which were a popular color combination in the 70's. (i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6"", 130 pounds, and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy, the square on the back pulls it in, so it doesn't fit like a tent. perfect for boots now, sandals lat",pos
"Love the quality of this material, and how the lines fall on the back. i got a a medium petite because the small was sold out, and i like how it fits. petite sits around the hip area and it's not too long which i like. the color is definitely more of an orange/tangerine color - not red. great cover up sweater!",pos
"I was on the fence about this cardigan. once i got it in the mail, it's cute! it will go great with a long tank or longer t-shirt. worth the sale price! i ordered a small and is true to size.",pos
"I agree with other reviewers. it is beautiful but too tight around the chest. i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest. i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable. sadly i had to return it. i am 5'4"", 134 lbs and a 34c, by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual.",neg
I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.,pos
"This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5""1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!",pos
"I'm very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy, but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews. this skirt is more amazing in person. at first, the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person. but, as usual, moulinette knows how to put things together. when worn, everything comes together, the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way. the skirt runs large (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 h",pos
"I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.",pos

Super comfortable and on trend with the embroidery and beading - wore it day after i received to the airport over tee shirt & jeans and got compliments left and right - love it!!,pos
I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece.,pos
Great sweater for casual days. just the right length and fabric weight. very versatile. fit is true to size not oversized.,pos
"Was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress. i have already a few events lining up for the summer months, and i could see this working on those hot summer days. i'm short and curvy so i tried on the large in store (i'm busty) and ended up ordering the petite l online. the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room. i love the 3/4 length, i feel a great length when you're only 5'1, will look great wi",pos

It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.,neg
"This dress is incredibly soft, comfortable, and essentially lined (i mean, look at all that intricate embroidery... your skin has no idea it is there). the colors are lovely (the embroidery is sort of a soft peachy cream lined with gold) and the dress is even prettier in person. the neckline is low, but not too revealing, and, though i normally avoid shirts without sleeves, the cut is flattering around my arms. the cut of the hem is also flattering. in some ways, the belt seems like an extra pie",pos

I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 12 & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 14 or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5'8 1/2 & a 36d.,pos

"I've been wearing these shorts for years, i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length. the fabric quality on these shorts (and many many other retailer items) has gone down. sure, they're great when you try them on in the store..soft, comfortable, flattering, but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on. i wore these several times, sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall, and a",neg
"I really like this dress. i tried it on in the store and i had to take it home with me. the print is fun and bright and interesting, without being over the top. the grommets give it a little bit of edgy balance to the sweet, flowy shape.

a note on the the fit: i am a 12/14 and the 12 fit well. it is a bit loose in some places, like the waist, but it certainly doesn't look like a maternity dress. i think the looseness is a good part of the overall look. i am high-waisted, and the waistline hit",pos
"A nice rayon peasant shirt - like the sleeve length. good for a fuller figure, covers all the bad sports and very comfortable.",pos
"I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky, loose fitting, professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return.",neg
"This dress is beautiful. swingy and fun, and the floral pattern is just stunning for fall and winter. i am planning on wearing it with black tights and ankle booties. could be dressed up or down- very versitle. fits my tall curvy frame perfectly. love.",pos
"They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.",pos
"I bought this dress for my bridesmaids and it fit all 6 different body types wonderfully! it is a very classic look. the material is very nice, a little heavier and more formal.",pos
"This is a great addition! it's comfortable, pretty, and can be dressed up and down. most importantly it's slenderizing and a great length for me! i bought it in my regular size, but bought the petite size, noting the model is 5'10"" and where the dress stopped on her. i'm 5'6"". the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me! it also comes with a lovely, blue slip! such great quality for the price!",pos
I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.,pos
"This top comes in 4 lovely colors, too bad only one of htem looks decent on my skin tone (purple), though i might have gotten away with the silvery grey.
fit: nice falttering line, flares at the bottom and is loose aroun d the waist, so if you ahve a problem area, nice coverage.
feel: super soft - nuff said ;-)
versatility: i am not sure it will look great with everything on my body type, but definitly a nice pair of jeans (flare or skinny with boots),a and may try the pencil skirt look like the",pos
"The minute i put this sweater on, i couldn't wait to take it off. it was way too scratchy for me. so, for those with any type of sensitivity to wool, this is not the sweater for you. otherwise, i thought the design was quite cute.",neg
"Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.",pos
"This product looks great on the model, but for anyone with a normal body type, the band in the center is way too tight. i'm a 34a and wear a 27 pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips. the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph, it is truly lavender and purple. i really wanted to love this swimsuit, but instead i had to return it, pay for return shipping, and i am out about $20 now. very disappointed.",neg
"For myself it brings out the playful side of me. it is flows and just looks lovely. i wore it with a white denim skirt, and booties. i know white, and it looked great. the fabric is beautiful, and in the sun it is breathtaking",pos
Love it fits great very comfy goes with all,pos
"Ignore the nutty negative review because this sweater is beautiful and really looks like a hand knit sweater. the quality is excellent, with two side pockets that are lined. it's really soft and so comfy and thick. just perfect for my southern ca evenings all year long. 
so comfy you can wear it as a robe!
looks just like the photo; i got the m/l and it fits like an extra large, which i like in a bulky cardi.
super gorgeous! what a steal at the sale price.",pos
Love this top. so soft and it fits true to size. i am a 36b and always wear a large. i am a size 12 in most tops and dresses. this top is flowy and comfortable.love the purple color. wish there was a large in blue left so i could order that too. love it!,pos
I love these pants - they are very soft but the linen is thick and high-quality.,pos
"As soon as you get up close to this sweater, you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of material-almost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high. i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day. the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all. it wasn't for me at all even thou",neg
"Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet, but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined, and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i",pos
"I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12, hourglass), these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds, just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.",neg
"When i spotted this online i just knew it was a 'must have'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me, but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well, the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i don't think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh",pos
"This black dress with raised white embroidery is lovely and flattering. the fabric has a nice texture and is medium-weight cotton, and machine washable. the dress is unlined. it's a bit hard to get on and take off even though the buttons can be undone, which helps. there is a tie at the waist, drawstring-style. i only wish my store had the petite size, as i am wondering whether the xs that fit me in the store will still fit as an xs p.",pos
I bought this shirt because the reviews convinced me to. i bought it in the blue color and it's really cute. the design on the sleeves is also great and the back of the shirt looks cute too!,pos
Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints,pos
"Had a feeling when i saw this that it would be a great top. love the way the elasticized neck hugs tightly and has two little back buttons. the beading is elegant and subtle. the body flows nicely, not overly billowy. definitely true to size. interesting ocher color; a yellowy-green. this is one to own.",pos
"Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8"" 135 lbs., with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material, light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!",pos
"I bought this dress in both colors. it has an easy fit, is very comfortable and works well for a day dress, running errands, play time, and general casual. i am small framed and somewhat slender. i ordered the xs. the fit is easy loose, the fabric just right for the type of dress, like a favorite summer sweatshirt! i wish it came in other colors",pos
"I really love this dress because it can be dressed up with wedges or heels for a wedding or cocktail party, but could also be dressed down with a cute pair of gladiators. i love the pockets too! i'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who needs a go-to summer dress for many occasions.",pos
"This dress is quite the stunner! i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem. four stars in quality, though, as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition, as opposed to rayon + viscose only. still, a versatile dress, for day or night. i love the length of the petite size (please note i'm 5' 4"") the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees. a keeper.",pos
"I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all, this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed, because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over, but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week, and",pos
I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f,neg
"Feels great, flows nicely, and love the pockets that hide pretty much everything from a lipstick container to a phone.",pos
"This dress is so flattering! i absolutely love it! it hides a multitude of flaws. the sleeves are just the perfect length for me, as is the length of the hem. the waist also sits right where i want it in the regular sizes. the material is comfortable and has a little give to be a little clingy on top but flares perfectly on the bottom not too far out that it makes your bottom half look huge. just perfect!",pos
"I have several of these shirts and love them. i can dress them up or down, and they look great. comfortable and soft, and lose enough to be flattering but not bulky. great buy!",pos
"By itself, this dress is a disaster. it's semi-maternity and offers no shape at all. however, with a belt, it really becomes the sweetest sweater dress. i can't believe how flattering the dress becomes with a belt, the skirt falls perfectly , it's perfect, especially with it's rich colors.

for $50, you can't go wrong and i'm positive you need this dress. boots, heels, jacket, whatever, it goes up and down, it's perfect!",pos
"This was on display when walked into my local retailer, it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on, instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale, but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!",pos
"Google ""mr burns see my vest"". because that's me wearing this vest, dancing around the house singing because this vest is wonderful. my three year old nephew declared it ""cozy"" and anytime i wear it he cuddles up to the vest. bonus! it's flattering, comfortable, warm, machine washable, and goes with nearly everything. i would like a onesie made of this material.",pos
"This is a gorgeous dress, but i did title my review ""worth the trouble"" because of the buttons which a few other people mentioned. i ordered this from the website and when i tried it on at home, a button snapped right in half. my mother put on all new buttons that were stronger but look exactly the same. of course, i shouldn't have to do that to be able to wear the dress, but i love eyelet and was willing. the new buttons cost about $2.00 so not a big deal in the end.
 i agree with another revi",pos

words can't describe the beauty of this dress!
i hope they will restock it cause i would order size s (didn't know how it runs).",pos
"My mom pointed out this dress in the store a while back and i said ""cute, but no way i could pull that off. ""i am a short curvy and busty lady and have never been able to wear strapless dresses. i ended up ordering it for a wedding and it was a perfect fit!!! i got the petite small and the fit up top is snug but comfortable and holds the ladies in with no bra needed. amazing. the fabric is dreamy and this dress is so easily dressed up or down. hides flaws, excellent all around.",pos
Like the color and the dotted fabric. the length is good. the fabric on the back is a nice touch. fits well and hangs well.,pos
"These leggings are great because they are comfortable, stylish and can be dressed down or up. great pair of fun leggings to wear. i'm 5""3' and 180 and so i'm not a skinny girl, but they are flattering on me. i love them!",pos
These pants are perfect for any closet! they can be casual weekend or paired with a light top and heels. very comfortable. love the detailing around the pockets.,pos
"What?! i can't believe this got so many mixed reviews! i wasn't sure what to expect and now that i've received it, i think it's absolutely perfect. it's flattering, the length is great, it's tts, and the color is beautiful. i have no issues with the skirt whatsoever either.  i'm really pleased with this purchase and i can't wait to wear it.",pos
"This is the perfect pencil skirt! the pattern is flawless!
the top shown with it here online is outrageously expensive! i paired it with a lace turquoise top that retailer has in stores and you can also wear it with a wine colored top. i would not wear it with black because you just lose the stunning colors.
if you love fall colors this skirt is perfect!!",pos
"When i first saw this too online i thought it was beautiful. i was right. when jt came in the mail, i really loved how the embroidery was intricate and detailed. the colors also popped making it a great shirt for spring, summer, or early fall.",pos
I have two pair of these jeans. one at the original length for heels and one hemmed for flats. i'm ordering another pair because i wear them constantly.,pos
"I am a curvy girl with boobs! this dress was perfect. it hugged in all the right places and had room for my bust! i did go up a size...however, i normally have to do that anyway for the top to fit.

this dress is funky, and i look forward to wearing it with tights and boots in the winter, very comfortable. it has pockets!!!",pos
"I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.",pos
"Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small, but the xsm worked better for me with this top.",pos
"They are exactly as picture. i have a lot of extra skin on my midsection, due to pregnancies. they are a little high waist so they grab all the midsection perfectly. the fabric is good quality, the tones are just beautiful... it is a little bit see through on your bum. i always try to hide my bum so no issue for me.",pos
"This dress looks so plain on this model you'd never guess it looks so adorable on. i saw it as i walked into my local retailer and tried it on quickly over skinny jeans i was wearing with grey suede boots and it looked amazing! it's a perfect teacher dress. wear it over tights or jeans during colder weather, chunky sandals during warmer weather. it has side pockets i absolutely love. you must try it on to believe it. the fabric is soft and of great quality.",pos
"Just bought this for easter and it fits beautifully! not only is the cut very flattering, but the colors and fabric are perfect for spring!",pos
"Comfy, will be great with a sweater or vest over it.  love the pink color.",pos
"I splurged on this dress when it was first in stock a year ago and haven't regretted it for a minute. it is my go to dress for work, cocktails, and once, two weddings in one day! the print is gorgeous and the fabric is super comfortable. i love twirling in it as the dress has just enough stretch with a little flounce. the length is ladylike and the sleeves provide perfect coverage for my arms. the seam between the bodice and the skirt hits right at your natural waist and the look really flatters",pos
"I bought this is a size small, i'm 5'8"" 140 and the fit it perfect. it is a very pretty red and looks very cute on. i'm very happy i bought it but i did buy it on sale otherwise i may have hesitated because of the price.",pos
"Love this top for spring - great with athletic leggings, regular leggings or jeans. it is a lot longer in the back, which i like as it covers my butt and makes leggings work-appropriate. great quality. true to size - i am 5'9"" and 128 lbs - xs fits perfectly. fabric is a little wrinkly but that is intentional. lighter material so it is good for spring weather, but sturdy enough not to be see through at all.",pos
"This top is well made and fits me like a glove. i am only 5'1"" but have a very muscular build. the xs fits perfectly--slimming around the torso but roomy enough in the shoulders and arms. the fabric is a nice upgrade from typical flannel.",pos
"This sweater is beautiful!
the lace is gorgeous and the sweater is soft and cozy.....rare to find a top that is stunning and comfortable at the same time!
the lace is very high quality, and enhances the sweater in a very sophisticated way.....adding that little something special.
the color keeps the overall look elegant and appropriate for any age.
runs true to size.",pos
"Loved the styling, versatility, fit & quality of this top! length was good, not too fitted, perfect piece under cardigans & jackets. will look great with jeans, leggings or skirt. very happy with this purchase.",pos
These are super comfy and so flattering. i feel like the picture doesn't do them any justice! they would also look cute paired with wedges!,pos
I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.,neg
"Really wanted to love, the top was very flattering and loved the material: very swingy and forgiving. but way to much material, i was drowning in it. sized down to x small but no go.",neg
Dress is awesome and makes you look skinnier.,pos
I love everything about this dress. beautiful vibrant color and fabric. i got the sp which is a perfect length for me to wear with the jasper & jeera nijar sandles. it is very flowy and full but i love that about it. happy i was able to snag a petite size but i think the regular would have been ok. i could have gotten away with an xs but the small fits great!,pos
This sweater is so soft and comfortable. looks dressy with skirt and booties or casual with leggings and flats.,pos
"I don't know why i didn't pay much attention to this tee (the yellow), but i didn't. i saw it in the store, thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it, and no surprise, it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i'm small, i have several tla tees in medium, so i tried on a medium and a small. as",pos
"I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4, 107 pounds and i bought the xs, which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually.",pos
I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.,pos
"I ordered the white ""denim"" online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was. i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it. the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering, but too sheer for me to wear outside the house!",neg
Yes! this dress is so lovely. i wear a size 6. a size 6 in this was perfect. under slip over a delicate overlay. heading to italy and this will be so perfect. drape is so flattering. colors are feminine. cut is lovely. effortlessly elegant and reads much more expensive. don't hesitate. a special one.,pos
"Walked into the store and the first thing that caught my eye was this dress. great pattern and fabric, a quality, versatile piece. i am a size 4 and purchased an xs petite, seems to run just a tad big.",pos
"I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it's the perfect between-season item.
since i don't like garments that have a ""boxy"" fit, i was concerned that this top wouldn't work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy.",pos
Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(,neg
"And not in a good way. everywhere i went, i left a little of this sweater behind. within hours of having it on, i was picking balls of fabric off the couch, bed, and the sweater itself looked like it was molting. great style, fabric and fit (although a little on the long side,) but there's no way i can keep it.",neg
"I loved these pants. the fit well and were flattering. unfortunately after three wears, they came apart at the seam. very disappointing and frustrating.",neg
"I bought this in red in xs (5'5 115lbs). it's really cute and flirty, but not in a little girl way, which some ruffle tops can look. the material is nice. a little over priced, but isn't everything from retailer?! the red is a perfect red imo, it's got an orange-y undertone to it, looks so good with white jeans and black sandals. if you're inbetween sizes, i would size down but otherwise pretty true to size. i wear everything in xs from retailer and the xs fits perfect.",pos
These pants are beautiful and so comfortable. the liner is a nice surprise. they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket. i'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale!,pos
"I bought this in a large, i'm normally an xl. it is a very large on the bottom. i really like that style so the extra fabric was good. i tried on the white and orange. the white is sheer and i didn't like the fabric as much. the orange way really cute though!",pos
"The ""movement"" in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some, ""yeah, i can wear these attitude!"" not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is ""thick"" enough to hide flaws. i am 5' 120 lbs and i ordered the 4petite. i am usually a 6petite. the size 4p fits perfectly. i ordered the apricot color. great neutral. i'm so happy i was able to get a pair -there's a reason most sizes are sold out! i have short legs, and my legs are medium in size. i worried about the thigh",pos
"Tried this on to see if the size works in regular size, and i love the fir, it si very feminine and flattering. i will have to go back for it. both apttenrs are really nice, and it also comes in balck in my store.

neckline is super flattering.",pos
Great jacket. love that the hoodie insert is removable so i can wear just the outer jacket for work.,pos
Got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work.  more personality than a plain t-shirt but still comfortable.  got lots of compliments.,pos
"The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater, or a sleek turtleneck, and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt.",pos

"I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it's a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu",neg
This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.,neg
"I love this summery blouse. it sits at high hip, so no tucking in! the sleeves are fluttery and flattering to the arm. i own this same pattern in a knit, and like it so much i got the woven when i saw it. the only downsides are that it has to be ironed and it the sleeves are too big to layer under a sweater.",pos
"This is one of my favorite tanks i have ever worn. the swing style means you can wear it with any pants, and the straps are wide enough to accommodate a serious bra. i usually wear an l/xl but am wearing a m in these, so definitely size down at least once. you will love this!",pos
Bought this is black and white... love them but washed the white by hand and it shrunk...,pos
I love all the pilcro chinos. they fit great and the material is so soft. they also wash very well.,pos
"I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.",neg
"I purchased this dress in our retailer store. i usually wear either a 0 or 2 petite (5'1"", 115 lbs.). i was able to wear a 0r in this and it fit perfectly. i paired it with a sparkly belt from retailer for a cocktail party and received lots of compliments.",pos
"Great shirt! i am a tshirt wearing girl so i like to have a lot of different styles. this is more than a tshirt- great style and thicker than expected. great fit, overall love it",pos
"I purchased this dress in my regular size small as soon as i saw it pop up on-line and found it to be tts (34d-27-35), it hits just to my knee (i'm 5'4"") and it actually reminds me of the way maeve's devery dress looks and fits which is really, really nice. i'm finding this dress by floreat to also be quite slimming and the embroidery and colors set against the black is just absolutely gorgeous! the material is super soft, the v-neck isn't too low and i love the pockets so i'm very happy with my",pos
"Was looking for a top with this style. i ordered this top wondering if it would fit in the hip area after reading the size chart (it showed a close fit.) the answer is yes! there's room to spare, which is a good thing. i like the nubby front material and the hemline's asymmetrical style. i'll be layering this top with sweaters and jackets all winter. very soft feeling fabric. wouldn't mind another one in a different color!",pos
"Really cute top, the material is soft and feels like great quality. love the loose cut and slight detail to the simple shirt.",pos
"Top is very cute and wearable, fit is boxy but nice.",pos
"This sweater is very cute. i got a medium, i'm broad in the shoulders and a 34c. i wanted it a little loose. threw it over a tshirt and was not itchy at all. i feel it is light weight and perfect for our mild winters in florida. can't wait till the weather cools down to wear it.",pos
This blouse has a very cute style. the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer? there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami. it also felt slightly on the small size - almost too tight for my normal size.,neg
"The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped, but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!",neg
I just bought this jacket for my mom to take with her on a trip to europe. it is perfect! perfect packing piece that doesnt wrinkle and is a substantial enough weight to wear on chilly evenings. considering buying an additional one in my size...,pos
I bought this dress for a cruise i'm going on in january. it's so light and comfortable. i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. it will look really cute with a jean jacket and some booties. great price for this dress! you can't pass this up!!,pos
"Fun top, 5'4, 135 lbs and i ordered xs. it was too wide and boxy so exchanged for xxs and it fits great. i like the fun slant to the side. not tight on stomach which is great! :) great top.",pos
"I really wanted to like these, but they just didn't look right on my 5'3 sorta bulky frame. i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings, so maybe i'm just not the right target for these, but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try. the waist was too high for my liking, and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look.",neg
"Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!",pos
"This top is light and airy, but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big, but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.",pos
I just loved this online and love it in person. so feminine and delicate. just perfect for summer get togethers.,pos
Fabulous dress for both quality and design. the embroidery is gorgeous and the long sleeves make it practical to begin wearing immediately. true to size and flattering. looks darling with booties.,pos
I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.,pos
There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.,pos

"So i ordered both sizes in this, small and xs.  i'm 128 lbs. and 5""4 and the xs fit me.  at first i wasn't sure about this piece but after getting it on it starts to grow on you.  the top part of the jumper fits really cute and the bottoms are very wide and can be long.  i did get this at a great price so i'm going to keep it, don't know how many times i will end up wearing but thought it would be really cute to wear out on date night with my husband.",pos
"I couldn't decide whether to get it in the black and white stripe or the blue, so i bought both. these t-shirts are incredible--soft, comfortable, fit well (i'm 5'2 usually a size 2 in retailer clothing, xs fit true to size for this shirt). the blue is vibrant and, as another reviewer noted, there's a tiny black stripe in between the blue and white. the black and white is actually more of a cream/offwhite but still pleasing and versatile. sleeves roll up easily, which is a preference of mine. they",pos
"I love rifle paper, and when i saw this dress online, i knew that i had to have it. this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture. it's pretty and delicate, and can easily be dressed up or down. i found this dress to fit true to size. it definitely has that ""baby doll dress"" fit to it, but i love it! this is a dress that i'll feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again.",pos
"I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now, i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist), and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards, the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.",neg
"I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.",neg

"I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light, the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.",neg
"Lots of stretch in fabric so pants fit well. length is perfect for me. i'm almost 5ft 6 in and they hit at bottom of ankles with slightly extra fabric so flats, heels, or boots work great with these pants. i bought size 29 and i'm 135 lbs.

Highly recommend these jeans! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream. the wash is flattering on them as well. i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these. they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size.,pos

I purchased this jumpsuit in the store and i am so pleased with it. i am usually a 10 or 12 top and the large was good. the med was too tight on my bust. love the print very feminine without looking like pjs. cream background is beautiful. fabric is light and cool and i love the pockets. i was hesitant about the short length but i like it. this is a special piece. it's hard to find jumpsuits like this.,pos

"I had such high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3, 105lbs, the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress, but regardless, they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.",neg
I love how you can wear this with a t-shirt or blouse.,pos
"I bought this dress online and have to say the material is really soft, has a great weight to it, and i bought it in the red motif. i just wore it to work this past week and received a ton of compliments on it. i wore it with black nylons black heels, and a cropped leather jacket. it is so figure flattering and so comfortable to wear. i typically range in size from an xs to a s, and the s fit me the best. i'm 5'9"" and 130 lb. it is truly a lovely dress!",pos
Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.,neg
"Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey, but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at",pos

colors: can't tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove.

"Very flattering! i am petite, but have large breasts. so, i expected this dress to look boxy on me. but the flowy fabric falls perfectly on the body and shows just the right amount of shape. the pattern is beautiful and perfect for the cooler seasons. the dress is also very versatile. it can be dressed up with heels and a jacket, or down with flats and a denim vest or jacket. i know i'm going to wear this dress over and over this fall and winter.",pos

This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l,pos

"Boy is this a winner. the fabric has quite a bit of stretch, so it is form fitting but with enough structure that it doesn't make you bulge out in weird places. i can wear it with a blazer as a (admittedly dressy) day-to-evening look, and i can tell i'm going to get a lot of mileage out of it for the season's holiday parties. i am bigger on bottom than on top, and sometimes that can end up with weird bagginess around the bust for me, but not with this dress. i'm tall #5'8) and so the length is g",pos
"Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey.",pos
"This is a great layering piece. got in orange color and it is really a beautiful shade. i am 5'3"" 36dd and went with a m. very flowy, nice length (more on the short side), and not see through. i am able to wear without a bra, where the ruffles cover any possible chance of seeing anything ;). i have a black came from another brand and have literally worn it to pieces. goes well under a jacket for work, a kimono, wrap, denim jacket, just anything! i was a bit disappointed it is ""dry clean only"", h",pos
Fit is tts and comfortable. the color didn't suit mine but if the color works for you then grab it because it's a beauty,pos
The jeans are soft and comfortable.  they are the perfect staple in my closet.  more colors please!,pos
"I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it! i'm 5'5""and 118 lbs and ordered the small. the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets. i've been wearing it with a tank underneath and it's been the perfect sweater for fall weather. i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but it's actually less bulky than other ""real"" sweaters i have.",pos
"I always wear dresses because fl is hot. this one is easy breezy and fun. it's trendy without trying too hard. nice lines, the fabric is nice and soft and washes well. the pattern is pretty, i got both colors. i always get compliments when i wear this dress.",pos
"This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned.",neg
"Love this skirt, i ordered a small, i'm 5'1, about 120, still losing some baby weight, so the elastic band is really nice because it will still fit once i get down to 110. really love the cut, it falls just above my knees in the front, longer in back. i wore it to church with a cream top with victorian lace around neck, tucked in, and added a belt for a nicer finish, although the band looks good without the belt too. i got tons of compliments from everyone. definitely a score.

"This dress is absolutely lovely, from the neckline to the fabric. really feels like a well made dress. i will say that it ran larger than i thought though, so keep that in mind. it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest. still gorgeous though!",pos
I live in los angeles and this is the perfect beginning of fall jacket! i've worn it with dresses and with jeans. definitely has enough extra room to slip a hoodie or small seater on underneath when it gets colder. it's soft and stylish. the only downside is that the pockets aren't really deep enough to put anything in.,pos
"These cords are great--lightweight for fl winters, and the bootcut flare bottom is super cute with ballet flats or booties. i am 5'10"" and typically a size 8; the size 29 fit perfectly. they have a little stretch to them, which is great. very flattering--wish i could order in more colors!!",pos

"I was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy. this top fit the bill. the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch. i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments. it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out. it does run big so i recommend sizing down. also, the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem. great top!",pos
"This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan, but the quality and feel are better than usual.",pos
This top is simply amazing! it's a statement top everyone should own! the green is so rich and full of life! and the floral pattern is just beautiful!! i got so many compliments on it and i felt like a million bucks! confident and trendy! love love looovvveee this top!,pos
"Love the colors!! i'm 5'2"" and the regular goes down to my ankles like a petite dress would normally. if you get petite, it would be as high as it is on the model. the material is comfortable and i can see this as a pretty versatile piece.",pos
"I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom, 5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac",pos
"I tend to peruse the sale section when i am avoiding my work (quite often). i came across this top, but had never seen it before it was put on sale. i was intrigued by the sleeves, but concerned that the pattern might be too ornate. i was happily surprised when i tried it on. the fabric was thick, which i find highlights curves and hides rolls. the detail was enough that i could dress it up, but not so much that i felt awkward wearing jeans.",pos
"I ordered these in both colors. the red is much deeper in person, more like a burgundy than pictured here. these tees are very slouchy. if you wanted a more fitted look, size down. these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans. the overall quality seems very good, although they are thinner than i thought they would be (they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos).

"I love this dress. i would have never picked it off the hanger in the store, in fact i went right past it. however, when i was in the dressing room trying something else on i saw two girls wearing it and it was adorable. i immediately tried it on and loved it. i think it runs really big. i am normally a size 8/athletic build and i bought the x-small. i small also fit but was a bit too baggy. most tops/dresses at retailer also run big so it makes sense this does too but there is no way i am a true",pos
What a flattering top! great with jeans or shorts. i'm a sz12 and l was perfect for me. love the colors - got lots of comments.,pos

I purchased the bird design top for my 17 year old daughter. the fit was true to size and it's a very unique item for casual wear. it looks nicer in person than in the photo.,pos
"Seeking the perfect ""go-to"" dress? this one will work for day or night, and it's an ideal match for transition seasons. the best part? the cut. swing dresses and shifts can ""tent"" my slightly ""top-heavy"" frame. this dress brags a side-zipper and slight tapering through waist to create an a-line. the small petite fits tts for me at 5'4 size 2 to 4. the fabric is a high-quality, textured fabric - wrinkle free, and a great pick for travel. best investment i've made this spring.",pos
"I loved the delicate and feminine print of this blouse at first sight. the fit was perfect - just enough room to be flattering and comfortable, without adding any unnecessary bulk. the style and print could even be paired with a more classic skirt and pumps and go to the office. the length was also spot-on - it's not too long to be a tunic, yet long enough to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings on an errand-running day. the blouse is very lightweight and sheer, making it that much more comfo",pos
"This dress makes my heart skip a beat. it's beautiful, soft and colorful. it's a lovely midi length which can be tricky for 5'5"" lil ole me but it's perfect. it has slits up the side for an easy breezy look. the fabric is so silky & pretty form fitting if you buy the right size. i'm a solid 4. have bought heaps of dresses from retailer and i can't stop, won't stop.",pos
"This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.",pos
"This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box!

i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot.",pos
I absolutely love this shirt. it's a simple tee but the open back adds cute detail to it. i ordered a small and it fit perfectly. color is beautiful also.,pos
This top is so comfortable to wear. the way that it hangs makes it as light as air. wonderful for hot weather. the pattern is beautiful!,pos
"This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use. 
touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt. 
although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything. 
just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size.",pos
"I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length. another customer had a similar review, but i still took a chance that it would fit well. the sides of the shirt have slits, and because the shirt is too short, it shows the skin on my hips. the rest of the shirt fit fairly well, but i'll still need to return this top.",neg
"This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions, depending on what you pair it with, which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres",pos
"Just love sweatshirts & ponchos, so what an unusual twist of style! ordered my usual size s during the promo. looks pretty much as in the pic. oversized arm openings are created by a string attached to the sides of the garment. it's ok but may eventually break off. maybe i'll secure w/ snaps or just sew it on by hand. wore it yesterday w/ just a tank underneath to lounge around. later wore for casual dining. it turned cooler & changed to a grey t-shirt underneath along w/ dark blue denim skinnys",pos
"I love this dress! it's cotton, but thicker/ higher quality. i'm going to wear it for nights out and to dinner this summer, and it's thicker material, so i won't even have to wear a bra with it ! it's a little lower cut, so be careful. i'm 5'3 and the extra small hits me right above my ankle",pos
"I have an hourglass shape and a large chest, so it's difficult to find dresses that don't like i'm wearing a sack or are too form-fitting to be appropriate. this dress is prefect for accentuating my waist, while still looking appropriate for weddings and other nice events! the color is perfect",pos
"Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.",pos
"I thought this top would make me look extremely boxy, but i couldn't resist the stripes and the cut of the top. i did size down, and so glad i did! adorable .... fun and flattering! and that's coming from a curvy girl, with a ddd bust. soo soft!!!!",pos
"Vibrant, lovely and quite long! this maxi works for leggy bettys - i stand 5'11"" in my stocking feet, and the dress hem grazed the floor. not quite as voluminous as the photo suggests, but stunning nonetheless. runs a bit small. i normally wear xs to s, and i tried a xs in-store, but it fit just ever-so-slightly too snug. i didn't try a size s, but i suspect it may have fit ever-so-slightly too large.",pos
"I ordered this top on a whim and never in a million years did i expect to love it as much as i did. while it is by no means work appropriate, it is a fun top for a night out. the material is light and flowy and it drapes perfectly over my post baby tummy. i tried it on with jeans, shorts and white pants and it really looked great with all items. wish this came in a few other colors. for reference, i am a 36dd and a size 12, took the large and it looked flowy without being maternity topish.",pos
"I have these pants in the brown & red colors, and i love them both equally! they are stretchy, and stretch out a very little bit as you wear them, but retain their shape & neatness.",pos
"I loved this dress and it fit perfectly. i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight, and i am really curvy. i did however have a problem trying to take it off. it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back. i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too. i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldn't. maybe it was me, but this dress is too much hassle. if i went any highe",neg

the only color i saw in person is the black on, and it is calssic, so i went with it. shall wait for petite verdict!",pos
"Should have listened 2 a previous review! while this is a very well made garment, it really does remind me of a bathrobe, and will be returning :( too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great. also...this runs very large. the extra small was more like a medium.",neg

"I tried on the xs in the store and decided to size down (and get xxs petite). it looked much better. the length was flattering, and as others mentioned, the bottom is nice and flowy. it is comfortable, and the orange color is flattering and i love the striped detail on the sides. good casual dress, but i can dress it up with a bejeweled belt. i am 115 lbs 30dd chest for xxs petite...",pos
It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.,neg
"This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine, but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support, especially for an unlined bra, and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.",pos
"I just need to write a review on this sweater because it's the best!!! i currently own the cream/blue stripe sweater and have recieved many compliments. what i was most happy about it was the fact that i have washed it several times and the sweater looks like new and has held it's shape. i have ordered the gold one as well and it's still on backorder, waiting for it to arrive :) don't procrastinate, it's worth the price.",pos
"Got these shorts in both colors: the blue-gray and the red-pink. super lightweight in hot humd weather, and keeps a crisp shape (doesn't get wrinkly and saggy like other linen shorts do). really nice quality interior finish and both front and back pockets are a usable depth.

if you're between sizes go for the smaller as they do stretch a bit over the day. i got these in a size 2 and they get a little loose on my 33""-25""-37ish"" frame. i'm 5'2"" and the petite was sold out, so i don't know if t",pos
"The tank looks nothing like the one pictured, mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also, i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.",neg
"It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.",pos
"This dress is gorgeous! the store only had a size 12, so i am waiting for my size 8 to arrive. very pretty navy color. 
super cute. love all the embroidery detail. my niece is getting married in june and i can't wait to wear it!.
i normally wear a 6 or 8. judging by the fit, i think the 8 will be perfect.",pos

"I ordered this dress in navy for fall, and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe. i am 125 lbs and size 27 in jeans. i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small, and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy, making it more modest, but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figure-accentuating look. the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel. the navy flower",pos
"I opened the package and the dress is two pieces. it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over. the sweater was too short for me, as i am busty and would not work. i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didn't try it on.",neg
"First, this picture does not do this shirt justice. in fact, the hanger does not do this shirt justice. you must try this shirt on! it drapes so well. not as soft as some cloth & stone tops, but it is still very soft. the slightly stiffer feel makes it easier to dress up. there's no pockets, which is nice in a button down. it drapes in a very flattering way. i've never been happier with a cloth&stone garment. i normally wear a small in this brand, and that is true for this top as well. however,",pos
I love this top. it looks as great in person as it does on-line. it does require some adjustment while wearing because it slips up onto the shoulders more than i prefer. the quality is nice and it is very pretty. it is great with skinny jeans and heels for a fall look.,pos
"This shirt is so cute alone with jeans or dressed up with nice jewelry, a scarf or cardi. its just the right weight, true to size, drapes nicely and its very flattering. i""m sorry i didn't order more when i had the chance. its already sold out in the colors and sizes i wanted. excellent quality as usual -- thanks again retailer!",pos

"This is a beautiful dress! great and flattering fit, comfortable, adorable print (the blue is stunning), and nice movement. one can't really see it in the photos, but the skirt is actually pleated. imo this adds interest and originality to the dress. i've been getting lots of compliments. get it while you can!",pos
I purchased this jacket as a gift for my daughter for christmas. i thought it would look nice on her and i love retailer. she was very surprised and loved it. she wore the jacket the next day and it looked lovely on her. a very unique and beautiful addition to her wardrobe.,pos
Looks and fits just like the picture. fabric is nice and soft. looking forward to wearing this tunic as soon as the weather cools just a little,pos
"These pants are so great, light, comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made, and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants.",pos
"This is the softest most comfortable dress ever. i bought a large because it was the only one in stock at the store. i'm 5'9, 135 and it's a little loose but still flattering and comfortable due to my height. if you are tall you will not be disappointed w this dress!",pos
"I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type, which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman's frame, but it definitely works for me. i'm 5'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress.",pos
"I just got this top today. the print is just as beautiful in person as it is on the web. it is so incredibly soft and comfortable. i tried it on and it fits just like the photo. i am 5'8 so i can get away with the blousy effect, but, i think that is part of why it is so charming. i think you could dress it up or down really well. i am really pleased.",pos
I just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it! it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual 6 so i bought the 8 and it fits just fine (34d-27-35). the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage 30's/40's and so cute. i didn't find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this. i highly recommend!,pos
"This top exceeded my expectations. i got it in the gray striped pattern, size small. it's probably the combination of the pattern and the removable padding that makes it very flattering on my small chested figure (i would imagine big chested gals would not find enough support in this one though). the fabric is very soft and comfortable with just enough stretch. overall, very happy with this top. but does it have to be so expensive, retailer?",pos
These pants are amazing. they are so comfortable and fit true to size. i typically wear a 28 or 29 depending on the pants and the 28s fit me perfectly. i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants. i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive. i want every color!,pos
I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!,pos
I have been searching for these pants my whole life. i have them in several colors. i wear the moss most often. i'd recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes. they stretch a bit as you wear them. one other thing- after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly.,pos
"This top is great and perfect for fall/winter. i've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far...great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look, or dress it up with black jeans and boots. great layering piece as well. the fabric is soft and comfortable. the fit is nice and relaxed, but tailored on the sides to give you some shape. the colors are beautiful.great buy, i highly recommend!",pos
"This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant, beautiful pattern, the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me, so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color, it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!",pos
"Online this dress caught my eye but the reviews seemed to indicate there was something weird with the length so i did not want to order it online and have to send it back etc...because i am 5'5"" and did not know weather to get the petite or the regular! my local store had it and i bought a regular small and it is not too long. it comes just to the ground in the back like any other maxi. it is super comfortable and gorgeous! i am not sure where i am going in it yet....but it was just too pretty o",pos
"Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable.",pos
The online pic does not even do this beautiful blouse justice. in person it is stunning and goes with everything.,pos
"These are really stunning. they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams. i love the mirror image pattern. they're just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on, but once on, they actually fit perfectly. so, i think that's actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit. i'm 115, 5'6"" and i got the xs.",pos
Cute top and flattering to wear. fits nicely and i'd say true to size. can't wait to wear it.,pos
I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug. you need a big chest and small legs and bottom. too bad. it's very cute.,neg
"In my opinion, the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase. adorable cut and style, comfortable and cute. it's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans. love this!",pos
"I have these pants in the blue/grey color and like them so much i got them in olive. wash well, fit perfectly... easy to throw on and look great!!",pos
"I purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered. all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry. the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable. the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build. i felt these were in general true to size. no doubt i will wear these all winter!
thanks antro!!",pos
"I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason. the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it. i can't imagine how they got it to fit this model so well. i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves, so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue. unfortunately, i had the same problem. i am a c+ cup size. perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust. i ordered t",neg
"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",neg
I can't stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric. i don't consider that high-quality.,neg
"I love these leggings so much i bought them in every color/design!!! they are amazing!
super stretchy and great for an active lifestyle be it pilates, yoga, playing with kids at the park or coffe with the girls.",pos
"Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3"" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small, but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite, but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows, yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say, i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts, the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared",pos
"I love wearing this. it is a little slice of summer, which i am desperately hanging on to. the color pops, it's so very comfortable, & the back is a work of art! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt, or down with capri style pants.",pos
"This coat is simply beautiful. i love the slits on the sides, it makes it unique and sexy. i would suggest that you go up a size so the silhouette is not disturbed by any pulling or tugging. i'm so happy with my purchase!",pos
"I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4"" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small.",pos
Blue jeans that fit like a dream & they were on sale.,pos
"The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful, but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look. i have a large chest, but the similarly cut blouse (without the textured fabric - from the same designer) fit me fine. this one is just cut differently. i even tried sizing up and down - to no avail. the photo on the model seems misleading because i don't see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone - even with a smaller chest. i was so",neg
"I was so curious to see this skirt. it looks just like pic. really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric. my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric. i love maxi skirts. i am 5&#39;8&quot; and 136 lbs. it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric. i have slim hips but this made them look larger. skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness. loved it and someone else might love it but for me, it was too much. wish it worked!",neg
"Best jumpsuit ever! so soft and always gets compliments! get one now before they're gone. also it is supposed to be tied in front! i'm 5'3"" and the small petite is just perfect!",pos
Chic and comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i'm usually a small/medium and thought the medium had a better overall look - sleeves were just a little long. the detail on the sleeves is kind of like the inside of a sweatshirt and makes it look a little more polished than the average athleisure top.,pos
So you're thinking this is a red and black skirt right? nope. it's an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex. spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line. it's really god awful.,neg
Fun top for day or evening.,pos
"When i saw this online, it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood, but with looser arms and a generally looser fit. just be aware it has bat wings or something (not sure what it is called). there isn't one picture included with an arm lifted, so without a really close look, the arms look loose, but normal. i returned it :(",pos
"This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased",pos
"I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous. it's seriously unflattering. i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it's still massive. but the slip is tiny. 

it looks so cute in the picture. but not good in person.",neg
"I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.",neg
"Unlike the other two reviews , i found this dress horrid. i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s. it was just too much fabric for me. . i have a small frame, so it was just so overwhelming, the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me. colors were nice and fabric was soft and light.. the belt made no sense as others have said. length was good. i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldn't take it off fast enough. i literally ran to the post office and back it goes. this is my",neg
I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect! i wear it all the time. it's comfortable and it's cute! plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it.,pos
"This jacket is totally adorable. i wore it with a man tailored shirt with the color up and the sleeves poking out.
it has a great swing to it and is very comfortable! it is sized perfectly. and i got it on sale!!!",pos
"I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well, and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer, i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back, so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders, but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu",pos
"This fits me more like a tunic so i wear it with jeggings. i am 5'4 and usually a 10-12 petite and the s fit well.
the arms are stretchy which i like since i have an athletic build. love the butterfly pattern !",pos
I am usually a regular xs with retailer tops. i took a chance and went with the xxs in blue and am not regretting it. super comfortable top. fits perfect and will be great for work.,pos
Love this cardigan! it is a really a sweet and sexy top. so flattering to curves and yet conceals too. the material is wonderfully soft and stretchy.,pos
"I love these shorts. would buy them in every color! the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too. not too short, not too tight. very soft comfy feel.",pos
"These run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand, mother. such a bummer because the quality is totally on point. i'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess. whatever, i don't mind having a size that's so much larger than all my other jeans. i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process. i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control. it's not retailer's fault. so annoyed.",neg
"I love simple, comfortable tops with interesting details and one that i can easily throw on without much fuss. this top is made for people like me!!! the ribbed knit is super soft without being too thin, the lace is quite pretty without being too delicate. normally, tops like this have the lace portion sewn to the hem but this top actually has a whole layer of lace under the knit outer shell. so, it's like wearing a layer of lace and ribbed sweater on top of the lace. the good news is, the lace",pos
There's just the right amount of billowy grace in this dress. the fit is perfect and the material moves and breathes with you. cute with a jean jacket on chillier days too.,pos
"This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors. i purchased the blue motif. the problem is that the model(s) are small busted, which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds and a 36d. i usually wear a small in antro tops. i purchased this online, and was excited upon it's arrival. when i tried it on, i was horrified. it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me. the front did not lay well (flat) at all from the chest d",neg
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than i'm used to in my closet, but that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. it runs a little large in the waist. also, the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured. mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh. however, i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come.",pos
After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,neg
"Love these tanks so much i have them in every color. i wear them layered under blouses, thermals, henleys, blazers, etc. i'm typically and extra small but the small fits perfectly.",pos
This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.,pos
"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i didn't notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this, i bought a small. (i'm 34a, ~125 lbs, 5'8"".) it's loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans, the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'",pos
"I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow, this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back, the slightly puffy sleeves, the side slit), and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot, so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i know the price seems",pos
"Immediately loved this when i saw it online and even more in person. i'm only 5'1' so i tried the petite sizing first but ended up buying the regular in an xs for the slightly longer length. the regular fit me like the model in length and i probably could have taken the xxs except the sleeves were too narrow in that size. i like that the cuffs are long so if you have to turn it up (like i do) it doesn't look weird. also, i found the fit flattering at the hips, following my hourglass shape withou",pos
This dress is beautiful. the neckline is not too low and the straps are wide enough so you can wear a normal bra! the waist is very flattering and the ruffle at the bottom is not too much. i am short so i ordered the petite and it is a perfect fit. now i just need some warmer weather!!,pos
"Picked this up in the white, and it's adorable. i'm a 2 in maeve blouses, usually just to fit my bust. i picked it up in the 2 because that's all my store had, and it fits. it's definitely tight across the bust, but not constricting. the shirt has no give, but it's still comfy, and to be expected from 100% cotton. the peplum is very dramatic high-low, and poofs out in the back also a little dramatically but gosh that's what makes it so gorgeous! great blouse, so precious.",pos
"This dress embodies the retailer brand. the design is unique, and form fitting for just about any body type. beautiful saturated colors and a great cut make it an all around classic. i wish for more of these designs. i originally ordered my usual size 4, but went down to a 2. this dress runs large. looks great with heels or boots as pictured. i am 5'6"" 134 lb. this dress has a timeless quality that you will wear for years to come. at my age, i try to buy things that i will wear for many sea",pos
"Love this top. it is exactly as pictured online. it's a beautiful coral pink color - perfect for summer (i think the description says ""red"" but it is definitely pink). i love the swiss dot material, the bell sleeves, the ruffled bottom. they all work perfectly together to make for an adorable top. it almost seems as if it can be worn off the shoulder, due to the elastic neckline, but i prefer it on, as pictured on the model. 

the fit is tts. i ordered an xs and that is what i usually wear fro",pos
I was fortunate to buy one of the last petite mediums in this style! the knit is soft and comfortable and doesn't seem likely to snag. there are a variety of stitches through the upper areas which add subtle differences. the colors are fantastic. this will be great for the cooler months. it looks fabulous with denim.,pos
"I loved this jacket it is very cute until i washed it! i followed the care instructions and it still does not wash well. the arms shrank about half an inch making them a little short, i have been rolling them up",pos
"Eva franco has done it again by creating another fabulously flattering, unique, and compliment grabbing skirt. it runs true to size and is very easy to move in and wear. this is my 10th skirt of hers and i love them all.",pos
"Ordered online and love it,exchanging however from s to m 'cos the fit is so perfect and i want to allow for extra room at the festive season:)",pos
"I purchased this dress in my normal small size - via online. i exchanged it it for a medium in the store as the shoulders were just a little too tight for me. i plan on wear it with tights/leggings as it's a little to short on my 5'9"" frame. well made and the bodice has so much detail but not over the top.",pos
I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!,pos
"I ordered this dress online but it turned out to be too small. i loved the color, fabric, and overall quality. i should have ordered one size up.",pos
"Tried this on a whim in store, and it might not look like much on the hanger, but this beauty fits perfectly and is quite flattering! it is loose without being billowy (still has nice tailoring for shape), the fabric is light but good quality, and the pattern is super cute. i was shocked when i saw that the price was much lower than expected - this is a true win, even at full price. for reference, i'm 5'7"" 128lbs and took my usual size s.",pos
This was exactly as expected. i ordered my usual size medium. fit well. good quality fabric. it's one of my comfy weekend go to items.,pos
"This is a great dress! it's cut nicely, is flattering, and it's not too short. if i put it on, i look put together in a matter of seconds. the dress fits true to size. one thing, i would agree with the other review that this is not really ""tweed."" instead it is made out of a patterned stretchy material that is a little thinner than tweed. the colors are really beautiful, and while the blues and reds are more intense in real life, it looks terrific.",pos
"I love this dress. it is super cute and comfy. i am 5'7 and a size small, 4 and 36c and i got this dress in a 4 and it fits great. a 2 might be a little more fitted on my waist but the 4 is comfortable and looks great. the length is perfect, not too short at all.",pos
I love that the dress slip got a different pattern. very easy fun for summer but you can also layer it in fall,pos
These pants have great style and movement.,pos
"This top is so soft and with a henley neck opening and longer ribbed shirttail hems, it not only feels heavenly against the skin but it gives off a casual chic vibe. it is also great for layering under shorter sweaters and sweatshirts to give my staples a little oomph. it is a bit sheer so cami is a must. i am also not sure how well it will hold up after washings, especially since it's priced quite high. i love it so much that i will most probably end up keeping it it is true to size. i ordered",pos
"This is a quirky, whimsical, uniquely designed top that's sure to get a lot of comments and opinions (and hopefully good ones!). i really love it. think it is what it is, a fun, conversation piece.  and isn't that what's great about fashion? tts, very comfy, yes boxy, but i don't think in a bad way. the ruffle on the bottom is adorable. would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties, or even a darker denim. hits mid bum. nice quality too.",pos
This skirt is stunning. the red is so vibrant. this will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come. it can be dressed up or down. love it!,pos
"This is the softest flannel ever! while i don't think i'd wear it outside, it is super comfy just lounging around. it runs very large, but since it's a flannel romper, not a problem. absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes!",pos
"In nature pilco fashion, these jeans are amazing. i wear them rolled down, they have a slight boot cut, but not overly. i am 5'10 and the bottoms fall right to my heel- meaning the hem doesn't drag on the ground-finally the perfect pair of jeans. they also do not stretch out and keep shape after wearin all day! highly recommend, although a little pricy for pilcro, worth the splurge.",pos
"After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!",pos
"I have wanted a boiled wool jacket for years. finally. i got the gray/navy. soft, warm and classic. i expect it to last forever. it is the right weight for out door wear in warmer climates or late fall/early spring in minnesota. the sleeves are long, but push up nicely, and roomy enough to go over a long sleeved blouse. i paired it with the tartan charlie trousers, and it is very polished for work. soft. but someone sensitive to wool might find it itchy. i agree that it is a little boxy--but i t",pos
"This dress is even better in person than in the photos online. the colors are vibrant, the material has a nice, warm weight to it, and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special. i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons, as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it didn't fall off.

the dress does run a little small, i think - i normally am an extra small, but the small fit me very well.",pos
"This is a super cute peasant top. super light weight and perfect for summer, looks good with jeans or shorts, perfect for summer, spring, or fall. colors are super pretty and bright.",pos
"A great wrap dress with many buttons, the dress stays on better than any other wrap dress i ever owned.",pos
"I ordered this dress in both a petite xs and regular xs and the petite fit the best. for the first time in my life i did not have to shorten a maxi dress and i am 4ft 10""! 
the color is a beautiful dark blue( not sure why the color online says charcoal) and the opening at the chest area is a little low, but nothing that double sided tape can not fix.  another bonus, as other reviewers have stated,  is that you can wear a regular bra. lastly it does not wrinkle, so you can bring this on vacation",pos
"This is a super cute t-shirt!  it runs a little big and not as long as some t-shirts which is good.   it hits mid-hip on me and i'm 5'7"".    i got the gray at my retailer store and liked it so much i ordered the black one too.   warning:  the black one is actually a brownish-black which i didn't like so back it goes.",pos
"I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas. it looked adorable (and long!) on the model. however, it doesn't even cover my butt, that's how short it is. if you're anything over 5'4"", i'd say it'll be too short for leggings.",neg
"I bought this in the store because it was irresistible. generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks. the colors are delicious - they go with everything in the grey-rose-blue pallet. the fabric is superb, heavy and glossy, good for cold weather. the size is generous in the upper body (not so much in the hips). i usually take a small or medium. there were only smalls left in the store so i couldn't try an xs. the reversible inside fabric is a complete",pos
"I bought a petite, size 2. i am 5'3"", 111 lb - it fit perfect with a tiny bit of room. looks just like the one pictured. length on me was about 1 inch lower than the model. very bright with multiple colors. has a nice stretch. very cute.",pos
"I got this when it went on sale (in navy and coral colors), awesome dress for any occasion! as far as complaints go about the straps, its meant to be low-cut! i really like the basket weave bodice although that does make it more difficult to zip up, but i found it was easier to just slip the dress on zipped up since the stretchy fabric gives quite a bit rather than deal with the zipper. i normally wear about a 0-2 in most retailer brands and have the dress in both sizes (didn't notice a big differ",pos
I tried on the petite in the store and loved it it's just the color kind of washes me out a bit... nut i did love hte fit and style...,pos
"It's like a coat for your legs, and lined with some silky fabric. the only flaw is a slight bulkiness where the fly hooks up.  i am a little sad that they don't have a petites, because i think this is proportioned for women 5'5"" and over, and i am only 5""3"". also not recommended for anyone with a tummy pooch. so tall women with somewhat flat abs - snap it up. it's a fabulous look for you.",pos
I got the blue print and i love it. easy to match with any bottom really. i like that it can be made strapless.,pos
I love this dress! wasn't much on the hanger but fell in love as soon as i put it on. almost returned after reading the reviews about the fabric content and printed design instead of embroidered but tried it on one last time and decided to keep it. the silhouette is just stunning. absolutely stunning. this will be a classic piece in my wardrobe that i pass down to my children one day.,pos
"This is a very flattering blouse, but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size, so order down. the fabric is 100% cotton, gauzy and light. it is very soft on the skin. i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on, but i decided to keep it and i'm glad i did. it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer, and because of the lightness of the fabric, it does not app",pos
"I am a big fan of maeve tops. i love the beading and structure of this top. despite the fullness of the design, the fit is flattering",pos
"I purchased the blue (a bluish gray), size medium.

the entire top, including the fluttery sleeves, drapes wonderfully and is sooo soft. i wish i could wear this top/this silhouette every day! it's versatile enough to do so, if only the other colors were flattering to my coloring. 

sleeves: i'm thrilled to find a shirt that fits/flatters my proportional curves and sports sleeves that don't grip my biceps. often, i must choose to fit my arms or fit my torso, unless i want the additional step",pos
"I just received my duster . i love it! the coat is as pictured. the fabric is medium weight denim with some stretch. it feels like a denim coat that you have worn for years. i'm 5'8"" and the duster hits mid-calf. i'm a curvy size 14-16 and the xl fits perfectly. the only issue that might arise is that the sleeves are long; they fit me perfectly but i have long arms. this will be my new go to coat for fall.",pos
"The second this dress arrived in my store i knew it was a must have. i am all things bohemian and this dress encompasses everything wonderful about a free fitting, feminine bohemian dress! first off the sleeves are not fitted. they have quite a bit of fabric to them (big armed ladies rejoice!), but have an elastic cuff so you can wear them high or low. the only fitted part to this dress is the lace panel (which still fits true to size), and the slip underneath (which appears to have a bit of str",pos

as stated before there is no flare as depicted in the photo but still super cute!
nice with flats, easy to dress up with some sexy heels.",pos
"I got this skirt because its elegant and can be worn in three seasons. it is stylish and can easily be dressed up or down. i usually wear an xs in bottoms and this runs about one size large in the waist area. still, i am keeping it and plan to have it altered. it is cute and completely worth the extra effort",pos
"I disagree with the reviewer that says these are more straight-legged. for me they fit tight throughout. sits perfectly on the waist with just enough stretch, but they still look very structured. i'm 5'0, 110 lbs and the 26 fit me perfectly. the length was perfect for my height. often pants are too loose in the ankle for me, but these are snug and perfect to wear with booties.",pos
"I received this dress in both colors (oatmeal and blue) for christmas, and i love them! they are super comfortable and great with leggings. i can wear them just to lounge around the house or dress them up a bit for church. i am 5'10 and 140 lbs and i got the small. it fits true to size. i would definitely recommend!",pos
"The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft. but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it. i wanted to love it, but it just wasn't working for me. i'm 5'8"" and purchased a s. it fits true to size, however it was loose around the waist and just wasn't complimentary on me. this will have to go back.",neg
"This tank caught my eye when it first came out couple of months ago, love the colors and the embroidery especially. the colors on top beautifu and it will complement any skin tone and the bottom is neutral so that this top will go with any bottom. this flows too goes great with skinny jeans and flats or put a strappy heels on and it's perfect for evening outings.",pos
Purchased in a small. usually a 4-6-8. i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing. great for those tighter dresses. the fabric is sheer but not super see through. the tassle in the back is so creative. it closes enough in the back to not look weird. i have so many plans for this piece. black is the perfect color too. the collar colors are perfect too.,pos
"Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers, i had to size up one size, but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5, 125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.",pos
If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it's flowy comfortable and a must have!,pos
"I tried a size x small on in the store and i am 5'4"" 120 lbs. i had trouble getting my head through the dress, and once i did it felt so tight at the neck, as if it was chocking me. the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no. i would not recommend this dress for those reasons.",neg
"I wore this dress yesterday for the first time and got several compliments. its unique and super-pretty in person. it hides flaws well and the material is nice. i must have bigger arms than the model because you can barely tell from the picture what the arm slits look like. i don't mind the way they look, but..the way the piece of fabric there grazed on my arms all day kept making me feel like my bra strap had fallen down. speaking of bra straps, the neckline is wide and i felt like i kept havin",pos
"This is absolutely beautiful.  but i am only 5'6""and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model. one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone.   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots.   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black. to me it is navy and purple. i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think you're going to have to do navy or denim.",pos
"This adorable dress has surpassed my expectations! i ordered an xs and s and am keeping the xs. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the xs fits like a dream. it's not sack-like at all. the top is fitted, and the bottom flairs very flatteringly. the bell sleeves aren't too long like some i've seen. the color and print are the epitome of fall! the length is perfect; it's long enough for work but short and flirty enough for evenings out. i can imagine wearing with heels or booties.",pos
"I have a hard time finding slacks that are a step up from jeans and that is why these are such a great find. they feel great, fit well, the price was good even before i got them on sale, i love the color and they seem like they will be easy to take care of. wish they came in more colors..",pos
I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i can't wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.,pos
"I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats. i have tried several different brands and these are amazing! they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for. the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom. i am 5'2"" so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress can't fix. i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som",pos
I have this in both the black and red. great design. very flattering and soft. the red is the perfect color. will get a lot of west from these for many years.,pos
I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of. if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only. also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view.,neg
"I bought this dress for my bridal shower. it's beautiful, tts. i usually wear 2/4 in retailer and the small was perfect. i tried on in store and the dress had a few snags and defects. they ordered me one to be delivered to my apt and it was perfect. the back is pretty too!",pos
"I saw this on a model in the house and home catalog. it looked very comfy but with an edge of elegance. i saw it in store in the navy and loved it. the other color is very washed out, not good for me being a blonde. i didn't try it on, and got a small as it looked as it ran a little large. i'm 5'4"", 130 lbs. and it fit perfectly. it hits above knee, a little longer than on model. it hangs beautifully and the blue color is stunning, looks expensive. i received a few complements the first time i w",pos

This romper is adorable!!! i love the long sleeves!,pos
"When i walked into my retailer store i was immediately drawn to this top. the online photo really does not do it justice. in person, it is stunning. i'm petite and usually a size 4, but the only sizes available were a 0 and a 6. it looked large so i tried the 0. it actually fit much better than i expected, considering i have a 32dd bust, but the seam across the chest was too tight. however i did not have a problem with the armholes, even going down two sizes. i have narrow shoulders, so maybe that",pos
"I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide. i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online. the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model. i am 5'1"" tall and weigh 110 lbs. i believe the petite would have been a much better fit. i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available.",neg
"This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.",pos
"Just what i was looking for. soft, cozy and warm.",pos
Just received this dress and i am in love! the colors are beautiful- perfect for both summer and fall. the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch. i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer. it was completely sold out in my size 0. however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color (and now lined yay!) i had to buy it. would defin recommend!!,pos

I took a chance and ordered extra one for my daughter-without ever running it by her first. i'd first seen the sweater in the store when another customer was tracking it down. it looked so nice and unique i couldn't forget about it even though i didn't try it on at the time. very happy i got it on sale-and so i got two-luckily we go to our different workplaces in different towns!,pos
This sweater is beautiful but runs large all over. i ordered a m and returning for a small. hopefully that works.,pos
"I picked this up this weekend. so gorgeous! i usually don't do maxi length. at 5'3"" it can be overwhelming. but this is so flattering! this is floor length on me. i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame. i'll pair it with a cream blouse (pictured) to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look. i'm usually a 4 and the small fits perfectly.",pos
"I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews, but i don't agree. these are going back. i ordered a small. i'm 5'5"" and 135 pounds. i am usually between a small and a medium in pants, but the small in these pants is huge. i could definitely fit into an xs. but i also don't think they are very flattering and don't like the feel of the fabric. it's too bad. i love the idea of these.",neg
"My normal size 32 fit tts. the length is great (i'm 5'9). i love the button detail on the bottom, makes them a little unique.",pos
"It's a little roomy, but this shirt is spectacular.  i've gotten so many compliments on this one, whether worn with jeans, work pants, or shorts.  all-weather.  as other reviewers have said, the material is sort of sleek-feeling - not traditional cotton.  for me, i love that, as i've been able to wash stains out of this shirt more easily than i otherwise would.  i am normally a tiny, tiny petite, but i ended up buying this in the xs regular because the style worked even though it's a bit loose.",pos
"They fit over my fatty belly and make my legs look good. comfy. nice and not cheezy with a bunch of 'look'. more than i would normally pay, but i like them.",pos
"The top is nice, good quality, etc.... but how do you keep the 'off the shoulder' off the shoulder? mine keeps inching up until it's just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline.",neg
I love this sweater especially the color. i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange. the fit was perfect. i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings.,pos
Fits great & super comfortable. i love this dress!,pos
"Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back, 36c (34d), short waist, and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought, so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front, but not as a high/low top would be. rather, it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater, and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2"", and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid",pos
This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.,pos
"This dress is beautiful. i ordered this in the mail and literally said ""wow"" when i took it out of the packaging. the color looks more like champagne in person and the flowers look fantastic on it. i was worried that it might look a little awkward with so many things hanging off, but instead the flowers really compliment the entire ensemble. it really just looks like a work of art. i'm usually a small in retailer clothes and that size fits me very well. i absolutely love this dress.",pos
"I like that you can dress this shirt up or down. go out, or lounge in it! very comfortable and i would recommend buying it.",pos
"Comfortable and loose fitting- perfect for summer weekends when you just want an easy dress to throw on. can go from home to running errands to going out for lunch. good color, too!",pos
"I looked at the other reviews before purchasing and this is the one time it didn't work out for me. a lot of people said to size up, so i ordered a medium and it was far too big on me. i reordered my regular small and it's perfect. it's shorter, obviously, but not so short that it is unwearable. i can't wait to wear this out!",pos
"I love lightweight coat-jackets, of which this is a great example. they effortlessly pull an outfit together and give real personality to simple staples. the unstructured linen, while indeed lined, gives this coat a casual drape for spring/summer. i see it paired with bright red joggers and a white t, with chambray or white linen pants, even as a chic beach cover-up. i un-tacked the cuffs to give the sleeves a simpler look, but it's decidedly day and casual as opposed to evening or work wear. fu",pos
"This dress truly is a work of art and i am becoming a little obsessed with byron lars' clothing line. this is my 3rd dress by him and i have been a size 2 in the other dresses. the 2 does fit in this dress but it is a little snug. not sure if a 4 would look as good because it is meant to be form fitting. the panels trick the eye into making you look thinner too. my dimensions 32c,26,33. it fits perfectly in the hips and waist but is tight on top.",pos
"I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.",pos
"I'm not sure what it is with ag. i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans, in blue, black and white denim. i wish i could say they're all great, but unfortunately there's a big variation in how they wash, depending on the fabric content. i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring, but after washing them once i can see they won't be a favorite pair. even with cold water and hanging them to dry, the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes. at this price po",neg
"The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage, which was a nice surprise, because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short, 5'3"".  neckline is fem",pos
"Being a 34d, i was nervous about the gaping between the top two buttons given the other reviews i read. they're right - it totally gaps even when standing still. so i took it to the tailor. they sewed the seam between the top two buttons. easy fix for a blouse that otherwise works. the color is great (i got the red one) and i like the fabric. i didn't think it hit awkwardly at the bottom seam. looks great with skinny white jeans.",pos
The quality of this jacket is outstanding. color combination is very chic and sophisticated. jacket is warm but not bulky.,pos
"This is a stunning blouse! you can't tell from the photo, but it looks very 1930-1940's. i am so happy with this blouse, it is gorgeous. i'm an xl, and purchased this blouse in xl and it fits wonderfully. it fits nice and flowy and i feel i don't need a cam underneath. i highly recommend it!",pos
"I was a bit apprehensive about buying the top, after reading the reviews.  surprisingly, i love the shirt!  it's very feminine; soft; light for the hot months; and, figure flattering.",pos
I ove the interesting details on this pullover. it is super cozy on and i love the arched hem and extra long cuffs. the crew neck is wide and comfortable but not so wide that you need another shirt underneath. great easy pullover with jeans or leggings.,pos
"I tried this (black motif) on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in love...after sizing down! i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large. i am typically a s, but sized down to xs, and the fit was not even slightly snug. the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped ""skirted"" bottom..very funky and arty-looking. i am 5'5"" and the regular length was great on me. as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer, i also can't wait to layer it",pos
"Bought this as ""transitional"" wear post baby #2 & i love them! will probably end up wearing them all winter long! i love that i'm 6 foot & they still are scrunchy at the bottom which i honestly wasn't expecting.",pos
"Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute, someone had clearly bought this, worn it, and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!",neg
"This dress is perfect for weekend errands or i could see dressing it up as well. the material is a heavier weight, will not wrinkle and the pockets are an added bonus. i purchased the small in this dress and it is perfect. for reference: 32d, 27, 35",pos
"I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy, i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately, it is. normally i wear a size s, so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline, but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately, this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.",neg
Every so often the perfect pair of bottoms comes along. this style was it for me. i'm tall 5'9 so the length fits perfect for a crop wide leg trouser. i will be able to wear these in the summer as they are light weight enough and also into fall before it gets too cold. can't wait to wear them. extra bonus i got them on sale. if you are short these will probably be more like a long leg trouser on you. also fit true to size.,pos
"This top is gorgeous. the colors are lovely, design and quality are impeccable, and it is versatile. this top just happened to catchc my eye and i am so happy with my purchase. it fits tts. i love it!!",pos
"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month.",pos
"I love everything about this sweater. it's well made, the color is lovely, and best of all, i can wear it with skinny jeans without feel ""overexposed"" in the back. i think my husband thought it was rather shapeless, but i like the look of a bigger sweater with a skinny pant. a must buy at this great price!",pos
"This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing, mailing it back.",neg
It is a great sweater that is soft but also warm i love the pretty design,pos
"I was thrilled when this shirt arrived.  it is as cute in person as in the catalog.  it's soft, it fit perfect, and it looks great with shorts and pants.  it will be my ""go to"" shirt this summer.",pos
"Perfect. easy , effortlessly beautiful design and just my favorite pajama ever. i'm not my ideal weight right now and these make me feel attractive again.love!",pos
"I hesitantly ordered this cardigan after it spent weeks in my basket. i love it! i am usually ""large"" by retailer brand standards at 5'4"" 145 lbs, but the small fit quite big and i'm glad i didn't go for the larger one. it is super unique and cozy. i gave it a 3 on quality because the knit is a bit itchy and the fibers do come off on other layers. it also is longer than i expected, it hits about my mid thigh.",pos
"My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower, and of all the lingerie i received that day, this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.",pos
"I love these jeans. the wash is nice enough for work. they fit well around the waist and have just the right mid-rise height, to make them stylish- not mom jeans at all. i am a pilcro convert. very comfortable too.",pos
"I really liked these leggings, so comfy! they are so soft and the waistband is thick(about an inch wide). i am a size 10 in pants, i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles. these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip.",pos
"Love this ripple-front top. fabric is beautiful, love the lining and the fit is perfect. looks great with pants and skirts. i also love the sleeve length. i purchased this in both white and black. great for spring and summer.",pos
The most important thing is that my husband said he really liked the dress when i put it on.,pos
"This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove. i'm a true xs, bra size 34a. i ordered the small. this was more than worth full price!",pos
"This dress is very cute and well made. unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust. the arm holes were too big yet the bust small, very weird fit on me. i am six feet tall with 38c bust, maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you. it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric. i love the dress it just wasn't made for my tall figure.",neg
This dress is comfortable and cute. i wear xs and this is true to size. the only thing i don't like is the neckline. it is very low cut. will have to wear a cami underneath.,pos
"This dress is very comfortable, lovely, and versatile. i know i will wear this often throughout the spring and summer months because of it's elegant ease. i purchased a small and am a 34c and 28 waist; fits perfectly.",pos
I love the loose vibe of this top. the bold stripes are super cute. i can dress this up or wear with jeans and sneakers. get this top ladies!,pos
I love this tank. i didn't find it to be see through at all. it runs true to size. it's super comfy and the lace up detail makes it more fun than a plain old tank top. it's a great basic and i love the lilac color.,pos
Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it's a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.,pos
"This dress is very flattering on. it fits close to the body but the layers are thick so it doesn't show too much. the material is stretchy and very cozy. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs and a 34c and the medium fit perfectly.",pos
"If you haven't yet joined the jumpsuit bandwagon, now is the time! this jumpsuit is absolutely stunning! classy, elegant and a stand out piece. i purchased at full price. i have a hard time with jumpsuits as i am quite tall and they usually look like an adult onsie on me - this jumpsuit made me feel beautiful, put together and graceful. i cannot recommend it enough! fit is true to size, i am a 4 and purchased the 4. not too short in the crotch and i am almost 5'10. form fitting but still a bit f",pos
"I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy, poor quality for the price.",neg
"Didn't work on this curvy gal.
sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.
major pass.",neg
"I have an hourglass shape, so this skirt is winner for me. classic a-line fit but with a modern hem. it's subtly shiny, very stylish, and comfortable. paired with a tight shirt and heels it looks extremely sexy. a sale price makes it all the sweeter.",pos
These jeans are so soft! fit is great and i love he higher waist as well. i can tell i will be wearing the heck out of these.,pos
Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress.,neg
"Cute top, perfect by itself or for layering. i sensed it would run large, so i ordered an xxs, 115 lbs, 5'2"".",pos
"The bra is comfortable and the design is good. however, the sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits well with minimal support. not sure about quality. this one might have to go back :(",neg
"I love this dress. however, it's not what i expected based off the pictures. 

the modeled photo indicates that it's a shirtdress with a drop waist. no. it's a smock dress with more of an a-line silhouette that begins at the shoulders. the waistline is more of a detail, like the button placket, than a structural quality. it's very youthful and whimsical. 

that said, it is quite beautiful. the fabric does not wrinkle easily, as another reviewer guessed. my daughter wrinkled it sitting on my",pos
"I am petite and ordered size small, and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice, but in terms of the waist and length size, both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all, and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item, unfortunately.",neg
"This blouse is stunning. i have been wanting it for some time. i finally broke down and purchased it. i am 5' 8"" and about 160lbs. i generally wear size l /size 10. i bought this in a large. i need a medium for sure. i could get away with the large, but it's very flowy. i think the med will be more flattering. i am planning to exchange for a smaller size. i would recommend this blouse for sure. if you want it, buy it. it's often times sold out.",pos
This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?,pos
"I ordered this in large since it was the last one available. i normally wear a med, but i do enjoy the oversize look in silhouettes like this one. the armholes are very low, but since i have hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) this does not bother me one bit. i'll just wear a super lightweight tank underneath for coverage/protection. also, the oversize fit allows me to wear a long sleeve for layering if i desire. i love the flow and fluidity of the material and will be wearing this one a lot.",pos
"This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.",neg
"I wanted this top so bad i ordered one size up (only size left in navy) and it is a little big but i still love it. so fun, love the color.",pos
This is a great dress for summer and very flattering!  i am 5'4 and could have pulled off the regular length but chose to go with the petite so that i could wear flats.,pos
"I bought two of these in red and taupe. this is a great sweater for those of us who can't wear wool but need to stay warm. the cowl is adjustable with buttons, so not overwhelming even on a small person such as myself (5'2""). the texture is yummy and so are the colors. softness factor is over the top, too. i wish it came in black. have not washed them yet, so can't attest to that feature, but i am very happy with the quality, so far. thanks retailer!!!",pos
Omg!! i just received this dress and it is absolutely gorgeous!! fits me like a glove. lovely rich reds and quality..... for reference i'm 5'2 and 99 lb and the 00 petite was perfect i could have even gone with the 00 regular. if it's within your means i highly recommend. :d,pos
Fits very strange. odd cut. does not look well on.,neg
"Adore these jeans! great length, cute cuffed details. could do cartwheels in these :)",pos
Absolutely love this jacket!! i convinced my girlfriend to get one too; we could not be more pleased. slightly oversized throughout the body - this is true no matter the size you buy - with great contrasting sleeves and back. the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist. perfect spring/summer weight. can be worn with a sweater/sweatshirt underneath. it's a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket - looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeans/chinos. perfect for mus,pos
"Gorgeous top, and generous to fuller figures. i meant to order an xl but somehow ended up with the l. was positive i'd have to return it, but it was perfect. went back and bought the white. it's one of those wonderful pieces that feels classy and fun at the same time. very flattering fit.",pos
"Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!",pos
"This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!",pos
"Such a pretty little sweater, gorgeous detail. i wish it were a bit longer, it was too boxy for my large chest. otherwise it fits tts. i wanted to lie inside of it and take a nap. so comfortable. please make more sweaters in this knit!",pos
"This blouse is so much cuter in person! and it's more golden than yellow so it's not as bright which makes it easier for blondes to wear. i tried it on thinking i'd never be able to pull the color off but loved it enough to try, and wow so perfect! i had to get it and it was on sale. love this and happy to add it to my antro collection!",pos
"I bought this online. this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer, when i received it.

i will be returning this.",neg
This dress is breathtaking! it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels! can be dressed up or down with jewelry & heels.,pos
"I haven't taken this off since i got it. and since then, i've ordered two more colors. it's definitely sheer, but the blue isn't see-through, though i expect the lighter colors are. it is a distressed look, but super-soft, comfy, and perfect to wear over work out clothes or dressed up with jeans. really a nice summer top for hot days. i'm 5'4, 135 the and the xxs is perfect--drapey, but not baggy. very flattering straps too.",pos
"This dress makes you feel like a little kid. it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress, for sure. i wish it had a little more definition to the waist--it just barely works for larger chested women, definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless. the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that it's hard to pass this one up. it's just too beautiful. i recommend it, but it's probably not for everyone.",pos
"I wanted to love this blouse, but the peplum came too high up on my waist. i have a short torso and i'm busty, so the placement of the peplum just didn't work for me. it is a very pretty color and fit fine in my normal size, but the peplum just didn't work on my short torso. i think this would be a very pretty blouse for people with a different body type than mine.",pos
This tunic is beautiful! the color is a vibrant blue. i can wear it with jeans or dress it up with my white linen capris! i ordered the small and it fits me perfectly!!!,pos
I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering. i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide. bummer,neg
This top is absolutely gorgeous in person. i am usually a size 12 in everything..pants and tops but this one i ended up getting a size 10. definitely size down otherwise the top will slide back on you and the arm holes will be crazy big. but it's a great top for summer. very cool and light. and the v-neck back and front is just so pretty. great buy!,pos
"I think these jeans are amazing. they are very flattering and most of all comfortable. i often will go up a size when buying white but i didn't have to with these. they also relax very nicely as you wear them. buying white jeans has always been a challenge, often they are to thin and not that flattering. i don't feel the same about these, they are the perfect summer white jean. i think i need another pair!",pos
I agree with other reviews.  this is perfect to throw on for running errands or just hanging out at home.  super soft and comfy.  got the blue and now want the grey.,pos
"I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite, sadly when it arrived and i tried it on, it was very boxy, stiff like, and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back.",neg

I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.,pos
I bought this dress on sale and it is perfect! i wish that i would've invested sooner and picked it up in a number of different colors. the cut is amazing and the cutout on the back is sexy without exposing too much skin.,pos
"A couple of months ago i bought the white in this top in my usual size small. it's cute & flowy & like to wear it with ankle or capri leggings. have worn with shorts as well. casual & cute! plus i love cotton anyways. 5'3"", 117#. think i'll go ahead with the other colors since the heat will be arriving soon....",pos
Love! love! love this tunic! i was worried about getting the regular size because they don't have my size in petite anymore but im glad i took a chance getting the regular size. my daughter said its just perfect on me. very pretty!,pos
I bought in white. great for a lightweight cover up. well made and cozy!,pos
"I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still, the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them, i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.",neg
"This is the kind of blouse you want at your reach when dressing on a humid day. cotton enhanced with beautiful detail. a very classic timeless, ageless piece. i bought the medium, which fits perfectly (size 8 top, 34f). my only ding is that the neck opening should be stitched less deep; there is a gap. funny thing is that, in the photo, the model's blouse is pinned exactly where i'm talking about. i didn't take off a star because i had a dressmaker fix the problem, but this was annoying. i wore",pos
"Really cute sweater, well made, but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !",neg
"This jacket is very well made. the denim is quality and very soft. the other fabric isn't as heavy as the denim, but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it. i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams. on the interior, the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too. handy for your phone. fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be. love it.",pos
"Beautiful piece, very well made and drapes well!!! i love it!!!! runs a little big, i'd go a size smaller.",pos
"I love this top! i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more. i can pair it with blue jeans, my pink pilcro chinos, and even my turquoise pilcro shorts. i love that this tee doesn't have the rolled sleeves, so it's a little more finished looking. i tried on both the small and medium and both fit, but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that. for reference, i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, 32d chest. i do think $58 is hefty for a t-shirt, so you could roll the",pos
"I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.",neg
Great tank top! loved it so much that i ordered 3!,pos
This top reminds me of something out of the 40's. it is super comfortable and just makes a very clean look,pos

"This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)",pos

I purchased this in the red (really more of a brick color) and wore it so much that i went back to get it in black too! i received a ton of compliments when i wore it! the fabric is a nice weight and it hangs beaufully. looks great over skinny jeans or leggings. i plan on wearing it year round!!,pos
"I absoluty love this dress! it hugs in all the right places, giving a sexy yet very classy look, very much a ""mad men"" look. the quality is fantastic and could easily pass for a vintage dress that has been kept safely preserved. i would recomend every lady has one of these in her closet, especially when you need to feel just a little bit prettier!",pos
These are the best jeans ever! never wore pilcros before and only ordered them because they were on sale. so glad i did! now i'm hooked!,pos
Lovely foxy sweater. i dressed it down for work but would look fantastic with a pretty skirt too!,pos
I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w,pos
"Soft, silky, lined in silky natural fabric, hangs great without being weighty. extremely flattering on my xl short body. i'm petite, but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes, so they go just a hint over my knees--exactly what i need. lovely details: sequins and weighted tassels. highly recommend!",pos
"I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect, the cut was great, etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person, and sad that the slit came right to my knee, which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(",neg
Very comfortable. im 5'2 so i ordered the petite and its a perfect length. no need to roll up. slightly slim fit but not overly tight. typically order everything online and didn't need to return. ordered charcoal color which is simply a faded black/dark grey.,pos
"I saw this in the store and wanted to try it but couldn't justify buying *another* denim shirt at this price. then it went on sale! as others said, this does run a bit small though the chest/shoulders, so i sized up one size. it's still slightly fitted, but my broad shoulders are used to that. i was afraid that the pleats would give a maternity look (although my chest size is not that large 36b)-- it doesn't do that on me. it's loose but not overly so--kinda like the current swing top trend! the",pos
"Loved the material and the style. unfortunately, my fears came true when i received this swimsuit, and there wasn't enough support despite a review i had read. as a 36d, i thought the halter would be enough support, however, the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely. i am sad i won't be keeping this though. the material is heavenly!!!",neg
"Gorgeous top/tunic. runs true to size. i paired it with jeans, but i love the look of the white pants in the picture. beautiful and flows nicely.",pos
"This is a very sexy skirt. very slimming...a great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe. dress it up or down.
the slits are high, so you are exposed like a short shirt.",pos
Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.,neg
"I love this blouse, it looks great under a blazer dressed up and great with boyfriend jeans.
it is loose and flowy, the neck line is low. i bought a medium and it is a little large but fits with the style of the top.
i happen to love the fabric, it is soft and feels great on the skin. one of my favorite fabric combinations is rayon (viscose) and cotton.",pos
"This dress is very pretty in person, and perfect for warm and hot weather. the material is comfy and breathable, and the length is perfect. for reference, i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses, and ordered this in a medium as well. at that size, it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large, but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body. i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist, so i would say it fits true to size for me, but w",pos
These are so comfy. i will wear them for 3 seasons. so worth it - especially on sale.,pos
"I love this dress, it's the right length and its very soft and comfortable. it is not really denim, just a soft grey material. i tried on the blue one in the store before ordering the grey and found that the small fit better than the medium - i'm typically a medium. usually in this brand i have to size up but in this case i sized down :-)

i highly recommend this dress is you are looking for a simple shift dress that you can just throw on and go.",pos
"Tried the xs in store (and 115 lbs, 30dd, 5'1.5""): fit like a glove, the chest part was fitted on me, the white is almost not see through, but nowadays, that seems acceptable (see though). the material is typical of meadow rue, cotton like, and airy. it is a basic white with styling. the top part also has some dimension, i overall thought this would look nice with my white shorts or with some nice jeans and blazer.",pos
T.la has another winner in my book. i decided on the blue and thrilled with the tee. it's a soft blue almost light periwinkle. fabric isn't so thin so it not see through. thank goodness. i actually love it so much i'm ordering the other color as well. i absolutely would recommend this cute tee. love love t.la.,pos
So soft and comfy. looks equally good buttoned as open. can be worn as a tunic top over leggings or jeans. the charcoal color is chic and i liked the different patterns on back and front.,pos
Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.,neg
"I love this shirt. it's different than other summer tops. it's pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size, and runs true to size. on a windy day the front will come open, but only to your stomach.",pos
Wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle,pos
"These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeans.
i loved the higher rise because they don't feel like they're will fall off like many low cut jeans do.
the material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever owned.
love the braided styling around the pockets.
the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.",pos
"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t",neg
"This romper is one of my favorite purchases. the material is great, the fit is very forgiving, and it is very comfortable. it is easily dressed up or down. i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well.",pos
I love this shirt! i received many compliments on it when i wore it to work with a skirt.,pos
"I am a brand loyal ag fan. best washes, best pocket placement and these are no exception. they do run a little big. i usually wear a 26 or 27 in the stilts depending on the fabric content. i tried these in the 26 and 25. both fit, but i went with the 25 because these will stretch at least 1/2 size. the distressing is the right amount, however i gave 4 stars because one area is directly over the knee which i don't care for. solved it by having a seamstress reinforce the back of it with a similar",pos
"This dress looks way better than pictured online. it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight (not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items i've purchased before) and lays great! i purchased a size small, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and thought it was true to size, i can't wait to wear this! warm weather, sandals and a tote for running errands!",pos
"It fits perfectly, slim but not clingy, and it has a beautiful pattern/texture to it. its surprisingly warm for how thin it is and its a great layering piece.",pos
"I ordered this on the black friday sale. one reviewer mentions that the fabric is thin, and i ordered it anyway because the design was unique. besides, i have another bailey 44 dress and felt that i knew what to expect on quality. when it arrived, i was pleasantly surprised. while not thick, the fabric is a better quality than my other dress. plus, the style is unique and flattering. i am 5'4"", and it hits 2-3 inches above my knee. i will definitely wear it to work with knee boots!",pos
"I love pj's and other assorted lounging pieces, and this one is exceptional. in fact, i plan to buy the pj bottoms made with the same fabric. i tried them both on in the store, and ultimately decided on the chemise because it is very special.
the fit is tts. fyi: 36c, short waist, broad shoulders, 5'3""
i normally wear a m/l in a chemise, and i chose a m in this one. there is plenty of room, but it is more fitted to my shape as a chemise should be. the piece shows curves, without showing bumps",pos
Just received my second pair of pilcro in the red. i loved the color and needed a back up pair. perfect fabric for year round wear. length is great for my height. love every pair i own. this is my 12th pair. love love them.,pos
"Picked this up end of season sale, but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it. it runs a bit large. i'm usually between a s and m at retailer and i'm a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably. i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose. it's definitely not a soft flowy t. mix of t-shirt material and linen. the main part of the t is cotto",pos
"I bought these in pink and added taupe to my wardrobe because one pair is not enough. i found a tiny variation in size between my two pairs, but for the most part they are true to size. i love the just below the navel rise. they pair well with strappy or fringe sandals. i haven't worn them with boots yet, however i think they'll be great since they hug in close to the calf and ankle without being tight. buy them in the size you buy jeans or one waist size smaller if you're sometimes this or some",pos
I just received this and absolutely love it !!! i love cold shoulder designs and this one is unique and so well made. i am usually a size small and it fit perfectly. i would say it runs true to size and will look perfect with white or black pants and a cute sandal. i am so glad i got it. love the quality .,pos
The dress looks better than the pictures online. it also arrives quite quickly after i placed my order. i am about 126 lbs and 4p fits me perfectly. the embroidery is so radiant in multiple colors against the navy blue dress. i am very please with this purchase.,pos
Love this cardigan! i've been searching for a comfortable lounge type of sweater and this is perfect. the sleeves are a bit tighter than the body. but i would wear it over a tank top so it is comfortable. i am 125 lb and 5'5' and i ordered my usual m.,pos
"I wanted to like this coat so bad! i loved the bright red color and design, but when i received it, it seemed very cheap and just too large. i returned it.",neg
Very happy with this top! love the design--very different. also like that the front panel is different fabric. buttons also are a fun detail. great shirt to transition from summer to fall. i usually wear xs or s--ordered this in xs and perfect fit. going to be a favorite.,pos
"So this is a pricey tee but i ordered it on sale?still pricey. i?m really surprised how much i ended up loving it and wearing it. ordered it in the light red, size xs and it has become my go to tank for the summer?i wear it every week. the armholes are a tab long on me so i wear a black sports bra underneath and it does peak through but not in a tacky way. if you don?t mind the price i would pick this up.",pos
Love this top-that simple,pos
"The print and style of this dress is pure 60's. so fun! the black and white is especially striking. normally, i would wait a bit until the weather warmed up a bit more, but this dress is so cute and flattering, i just couldn't wait. the outer layer is actually sort of an open mesh. it's not extremely delicate, but could snag if you're not a bit careful. however, its the fabric that really makes it stand out so it's well worth it. i'd say the fit is true to size except if you're busty. i normally",pos
"I got this planning to wear to a wedding, but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony. i've definitely gotten some mileage out of it! like the other reviews said, it is long, but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges. love it!",pos
"Loved these in the store but the 00 was sold out everywhere and i noticed the fabric was very stretchy. i bought the 0 petite online and was worried about the length. they fit great. i'm 5'5"" .",pos
"I love this shirt, very comfortable and has a nice drape. i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest, so i returned for the next size up.

very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.",pos
These pants fit great. the velvet material is a sleek look . these pants can be casual by day and are easily dressed up in the evening.,pos
"First off, this runs very large. i'm normally an 8 and sized down to the 6 but probably could have done a 4. it looked like a tent on me. the top part is lovely, i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering. this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now.",neg
Great winter maxi. soft and comfortable fabric. good quality. stretchy but not too clingy. fitted in all the right places and very flattering. petite was unavailable so will need hemming.,pos
"I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly. i love the simple, yet girly look of this top. the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch. it looks even better in person than in the pictures. the material is very soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans and flats or boots!",pos
"I bought this as a swimsuit cover and it was exactly like the picture. so soft, very good quality, fit perfectly. definitely worth it for this price!!!",pos
I love this dress! it has pockets in front. timeless. fun. dress up or down.,pos
"I expected this to be a pretty basic peasant top but was pleasantly surprised with all aspects of my purchase. fabric is soft and flowing with a perfect feminine vibe. it has a nice liner and the length and fit are perfect. can be dressed up or down as you like it. does run a bit large but it's due to the style, not the sizing. i ordered my usual size and cannot be happier with it. go ahead-press the button!",pos
"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!",pos
"I am 5'4"" 120lbs, got xs. it was huge on me. had to return it. very trendy, great quality, unfortunate design. not worth the money.",neg
I had eyed this simple yet stylish dress for awhile but hadn't tried it on yet. i managed to snag the orange version during the tag sale - $40 for maeve?? it is super flattering and will be a wardrobe staple for years.,pos
"I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well, no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.",pos
Wore my new red cardigan for the first time today to work. fit is tts. this is a true red and not neon or orange tinted. it wraps nicely in front and has a nice flair at the hips.. i also like the detail in the knit. i like to push my sleeves up and love the fact that they don't slide down my arms all day. i'll wear this cardigan a lot.,pos
"Purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly, if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect, it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate",pos
"I got this in a l, and probably i am a m. however, the waist pretty much fit, but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way. i don't think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress. this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust, but a small waist.",neg
Like the other reviewer said it&#39;s hard to get on and i had to size down like i often do at retailer. but it&#39;s so pretty and it&#39;s not too short like most rompers. we host thanksgiving every year and i&#39;m so excited to find an alternative to a dress/pants so i can work &amp; cook in style.,pos
I agree with the other reviews - runs small. would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable. waistband doesn't stretch all the way around. bummer.,neg
"This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique, however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down.",pos
These jeans are soooo soft. fit is great and the wash is a unique inky grayish color. perfect for fall. love.,pos
This is a great pair of trousers for work but can also be dressed down. they are very flattering and runs true to size. they're also a bit highwaisted which i love. my only complaint is that they are unlined. i'm not sure why a nice pair of wool trousers would be unlined. however i'm still giving them 5 stars because the fit and quality outweigh the one con.,pos
"I ordered this dress on a whim because of the lush colors and the sale price. to my amazement, it has become one of my go-to dresses. it is far more handsome and flattering in person. i ordered a m for my 5'9"" and 36c frame and the fit is perfect. contrary to how the back of the dress is shown on the model, the back is not straight, but flows whimsically thereby adding to its famine appeal. at this price, it's a no-brainier purchase.",pos
"I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers, but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws, the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck, not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining, this is a spring and early fall dress",pos
"This is a beautiful skirt and such a great piece to collect from erin fetherston.

the design and cut are very flattering on a variety of body types. i have more of a curvy shape and love this type of cut to accentuate my smaller waste (rather than fitted dresses/skirts that hug).

there are several linings that help give shape and volume. the stripes are made of ribbon. it's so gorgeous, i've received many compliments. i've paired with a sequin tank and glitter keds by kate spade...it's a dynam",pos

Very comfortable. super cute! my husband says it's the cutest bathing suit i've ever owned (and i've owned a lot)!!!!!,pos
"Sadly, this has to go back. i am 5'5"", 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful, the detail is nice in person, even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles, loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.",neg
"I saw this in the store and wanted to try it on, but ran out of time (a week or so ago). i thought i would need petite, but surprise, it does not come in petite...so i started obsxessing that i had to try it on, whcich i did yesterday. mistake, because i love it, and even if it is not peite, it workedc (with heels), and online it already says only a few left, so my size will not make it to sale... so i bought it full price.

cut is very flattering, and colors are great. also can be worn any seas",pos
"This is a stunning, flattering, well-designed and sized, magnificent, and yet wearable, comfortable summer blouse! i am a busty, 34f, size 8, and this lovely piece makes me look amazing. i most highly recommend to any woman. the 100% cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of ""give"". i experienced no pulling at the chest or back, which can happen for me. the bottom 2"" of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top, so you may not need a cami. the combination of leaf print/crochet",pos
It is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day,pos

"I like this sweater. i bought it in small and medium because it was 25% off and i didn't want my size to sell out. im keeping the small. im 5'5"" and 140 lbs and hourglass. the medium was way too much fabric. its still roomy in the small, but its lush looking and soft and will look pretty with jeans and high boots. i ordered the one in the beige as well but i think the lavender color is prettier in person. i think the beige may wash me out. hope this helps.",pos

love subtle squares, glad they still had my size at sale! :-)",pos
"This dress was not what i had hoped! from the online pictures, i had high hopes, but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap. the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress. needless to say, it's going back!",neg

I love this top. the color and the embroidery are beautiful and unique. i love the soft cotton arms and back. wish there were more colors.,pos
"Love these pilcro jeans, my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs, they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist, not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!",pos
"This is a perfect change of seasons into cooler (colder!) months piece. 

colors

It was hard for me to pay full price for basic white button-down but i am so glad i did. the high-low and split back detail give the shirt a unique look. it looks cute with jeans and wedges as a dressed down option. i bought this to go with the shoreline skirt and it looked really good together. this is a staple that can be worn multiple times and for many years.,pos

This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you're not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it's also very long but i'm short so this would be perfect for taller frames.,pos

"I had been looking at the dresses and jumpsuits from this designer for a while and decided to order this jumpsuit. i'm usually an extra small in jumpsuits, and wasn't sure to get the 0petite or 2petite. i'm 5'3 and about 115 lbs and the 2 petite is perfect in the legs and waist, but a little wide across the chest (i'm a 32c). the material is soft and feels very nice and like good quality. it's perfect for dressing up a little in the summer and i'm going to think of ways to transition it to the f",pos

"Beautiful color. emphasizes a small waist; top is fitted, so if you're curvy, beware. i'm a 32 ddd and size 10. skirt is roomy. agree with other reviewer that zipper is not smooth. reminds me a little of a prom dress i had in 1987... which could be good or bad ;)",pos

There were just too many pleats to this thing. it was not flattering. it looks fantastic on this model but not on me. oh well.,neg
"I bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer. it's perfect! being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin, i love all shades of green, and this green dress is no exception. the color is lovely and eye-catching and cool. as to the sizing, i usually wear a size 8, but to make sure due to the design, i ordered an 8 and a 6. there wasn't a great difference between the two dresses, but the size 6 top was a bit more fitted and looked bet",pos
"I've had my eye on this cute knit top for awhile and when there was a sale, i picked up both colors. they fit me like they do the model, a little loose and swingy, but not overly so. the colors look spot-on like the picture. i am rather top heavy, (34dd) but with the colors being darker on the top portion, i feel like this works without accentuating my bust too much. i am 5'4 and weigh 149, the medium worked out great. the knit is soft and it appears to be made well. the only drawback is a rough",pos
These are the perfect combination of comfort and beauty. i highly recommend.,pos
"This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.",neg
"I love workout dresses and skirts. i sport them in both yoga (if they have an under layer of shorts, obviously) and in high cardio classes-as well as for things like tennis. i like the extra breeze a dress/skirt will get you, and find them to be really comfortable. i really like this dress as it is not a super bold color (it is hard to find workout attire that is not neon colored). i prefer things to be a little more relaxed and less ""look at me"" like when i am working out. this dress is flatter",pos
"What a beautiful, comfortable material and the colors are stunning. i'm so disappointed at the unflattering cut. it fits like a shapeless tent, even the arm holes have big gaps that aren't snug. i am 5'2, 105lbs, and ordered the xxs petite.",neg
"The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest, jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit, can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better.",pos
"This is a great basic shirt. it has room in the midsection so you can tuck in or not. it is also extremely soft. i am 5'9, a 10 and the m fit just right.",pos
"This dress is as flattering as wrap dresses usually are. the x-small fits well (dress probably runs a tiny bit large as i go between a small and extra small), though i did move the tiny snap at the neckline down as it fastened too high for me. the dress did snag slightly in one spot but overall, it is really very flowing and lovely on, with unusual colors that look nice with late summer tan and gold earrings.",pos
"Love this top! has a beautiful shape, and it wasn't too long on my 5'3"" frame. puella always makes items with lovely, soft cotton, and this is no exception! awesome piece for summer!",pos
"I love this vest-it is a work of art in its design and construction but extremely wearable, absolutely gorgeous on, and perfectly warm and functional. my favorite thing i've ever bought at retailer.",pos
Love this dress! it's exactly as pictured and the fabric design is so pretty. will look great with a cardigan for fall but also will look nice for summer with the cutout in the back. nice too that it has a detachable slip.,pos

"This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress ""sack"" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats.",pos
"First, thanks retailer for not putting itchy wool or fur in this! it's so soft! gorgeous bias for is super flattering for those of us with less than perfect bodies. for reference, i'm 5'5"", 32dd, 28, 38. size xs/s was perfect.",pos
"I love this dress. it fits like a dream and is incredibly flattering. i vary between a 4 and a 6 in dresses, and the 6 was too large on the bust but the 4 fit great! the dress is longer than in the picture, the model must be wearing heels, but it doesn't quite hit the ground with flats. the fabric is light and airy, it comes across a little more formal in person but is versatile enough to be worn more casually as well.",pos
"I was doubtful when i first tried this on. the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well, more so in dresses than tops. also, it looks cute but not great on the hanger. this a must-try-on dress. it's just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity, but also feel easy to wear. the print and cut are flattering. it has pockets!!!! also, the length is nice, close to knee length. the fabric is good quality. doesn't wrinkle easily. i'm surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr",pos

"Well made dress, but too much fabric for my taste. it lays a little heavy on the body & does not give a slimming affect. the colors are vibrant & pretty, but the dress is too long, as well. as other reviewers have said, the front is too low cut, but turn it around and it looks & feels better. didn't work for me, sadly, i'll be returning it.",neg
I love this shirt. i have it in red. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.,pos
Best jeans! fit is amazing! buy them; you won't regret it!,pos
I saw this shirt on a friend and had to buy it right away! it has the comfort of a regular tee but the frills at the bottom give it that retailer look! true to size.,pos
The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it's short-waisted. it's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty.,neg
On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.,neg
Love love this skirt! such a pretty green color and a great quality. this will be a staple in my closet for years to come. and i love a skirt with pockets.,pos
"I expected this dress to be pretty, but was happily surprised at the level of beautiful detail. it's hard to tell in the pictures, but the dress has a black background with tan embroidery all over, and white embroidered eyelets. the full lining is bright blue and it peeks through the eyelets, with the slit on the back and the inside of the neckline lined in bright orange. the slit on the back has two buttons closing it - a really cute detail. it fit me comfortably (i am 5'7"" and 130 - got the si",pos
"I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that it's a much lovelier color in person, but that's about it for me. thoughts below:

pros:
- tts. i ordered the medium for my 36c, 5'9"" frame and found it sufficient.
- the color is much nicer in person, as the other reviewer mentioned. it's a richer brown. think ""mocha latte"" in terms of color.
- the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it",neg
"This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack.. living in l.a. it's 90 degrees one day, and 60 the next. the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate. it runs true to size and is very comfy. thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner.",pos
"When i tell people i invested in a ""horse sweater"" i don't get a lot of encouraging comments, but when they see it they understand. so cute, different, and cozy for cold days (winter is long where i live). really works as both a sweater and as a coat.",pos
"I ordered this dress online in 8 p in the orange color. the length was perfect but the dress seemed big. it was a lot of dress. so i went into the store and tried on a regular 6, but the dress was a little long. they didn&#39;t have petite in stock so they had it shipped to me and it fit perfectly! i am 5&#39;3 and 150 pounds. i don&#39;t think this dress would work if you have a big bust, i&#39;m a 36b so it fits nicely around the chest area. the length of the dress was also perfect!",pos
"I purchased this top at my local store this past weekend, and i have to say i already know it will become an easy, go-to top. it does run large, so consider that when choosing what size to order. i generally wear a medium, but purchased a small in this top.",pos
"This dress looks better when wearing, i am 5.8 regular size s or 6. cup 34 d and fits perfect. length and width. in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length. the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length.  but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily. i wish the slip is the same length as the dress. i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric. i hope it helps.",pos
"I love this shirt! i got the one with the skiiers. for reference, i got a size 2 and i'm 5' 6"", 135 pounds. it's a bit tight around my shoulders, but not enough to make me want a size 4. if you have broader shoulders, a 4 would probably be good. the bottom flares out a little and is cut shorter than other button downs. it's too short to really tuck in comfortably. the print is absolutely perfect. the shirt is soft and very flattering. it's pricey but super cute!!",pos
"Just ordered this in a small for me (5'6"", 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (5'3"", 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth i'll need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60's) and myself (30's). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos.",pos
I love this top so much! the fit is super flattering and forgiving in the tummy area-win.,pos
Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.,pos

"I just saw this in the store and had to pick it up. i just love this green color and can imagine it going with a number of different types of tops/dresses. i personally think this looks best with a chambray button down shirt with this vest over it, paired with slim fitting black pants and boots.",pos
"The neckline is beautiful, whether pulled forward or slipping back. the pure merino knit is very fine with the two front panels cut on the bias. raglan sleeves with high armholes. it is a tiny bit itchy, and normally i'm not too sensitive, but that may improve with a handwash in eucalan or something similar.

"Bought the green in the store. wore them every week for 3 weeks so i bought the bronze color too. i usually wear a 26 in pilcro because they do give a little during the day. i had to go up to the 27 because the thighs were a little too snug for me. there's a zipper at the ankle so getting you foot through isn't a problem. the fabric is sturdy. it almost feels like a brushed cotton (soft to the touch). they zip up the side so are very slimming. i'm 5'4"" 120# for reference.",pos

many years to come!!!!!!!!!!!",pos
"This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing. i love the overall design and colors. however, when i tried it on i was immediately itchy! the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be. in addition, though i ordered a size medium, it fit very large - almost too oversized. the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big. it's too bad, i really loved the look but i'm not the type to layer. if you are, go for it, but get a size smaller than you normally would!",neg

i am on the short side so i ordered in regular and petite and due to the length the petite is better. 
the material is soft and comfortable to wear.",pos

I very rarely buy at full price but had to have this on and it is worth it.  i sized down and fits great. tons of compliments!,pos
I loved this shirt online but when it came to my house i loved it even more. super comfy and really flattering! i love it!!! runs true to size!,pos
Loved this skirt. it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer.,pos

"Love this top, the cut is nice and is similar to the previous one that was denim, love hte colors, but they looked awful on my skin tone unfortunately.

sizing is true to size, i tried on the regular size, not petite, and it was fine (my usual 0 or 2, went with 0 as tjhis top is a looser fit, 2 would be boxy). the lace part is a nice added detial, the plaid is soft flannel. color is a salmon colr, with navy, but the dominant color washed me out (i am fair). love it otherwise!",pos
"This tank is so light and made with great fabric. i bought this to wear over pants - black jeans, classic denim, this fall, maybe with a jacket over. 
i purchased a size medium, and it is loose and comfortable.",pos
This top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe! it looks great with jeans/jean shorts. it's relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut. the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well.,pos
I love this shirt! lightweight and versatile! perfect for all seasons,pos
I can't stop wearing this. it's perfect for layering! the fit is great-loose but not a bag. i love that it's a wide open knit.,pos
"This dress is beautiful. i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress. in my mind, it takes me back to the 20s and 30s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early 20th century. the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear. i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls.",pos
"I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1"" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic, but in person, it really caught my eye.",pos
"Very long shirt, i have to tuck it in. i love the lipstick design and its great quality material. its really soft and cotton breathable.",pos
This fits a little short on me and i'll have to wear a shirt underneath even with a high waist pant. i still adore it! get it for the price!,pos
Beautiful and delicate!!,pos

2. the white is very sheer, but a nude bra won't show through. the navy is not see through.

3. i love the asymmetric hem in the back.

4. i'm a little concerned that the raw edge on the hem won't hold up in the wash, but i plan on hand washing these anyway, bec",pos

"This is the best dress. i received it last week and have already worn it three times. perfect fit. casual and so easy but the length and front details make it so fun. thicker than many other ""tshirt"" dresses... but light enough that i wasn't overly hot on super warm days. def recommend!!!!",pos

"This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer. i was so excited for the shirt, it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures. the flax is very scratchy, marring the softness of the rest of the fabric. the top half is totally sheer, requiring a cami. the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way, unnecessarily adding visual pounds. finally, the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches long--wh",neg
"I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good, not too right or lose. i took a size medium, which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me, also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i don't feel like i see myself all over town.",pos
"I've returned multiple pairs of trousers this fall because they were low quality/ wrinkle-prone wool and unlined.  the material on these, however, is high quality and weighty, wearable in fall, but also great for our much colder winters. the herringbone is gorgeous - dark grey and black with subtle flecks of red, dark pink, and gold. they are also beautifully lined so will keep their shape and not itch! true to size for cartonnier: got a 2 and tried a 2 in the monica flannel trousers. gorgeous!",pos

"Denim is a little heavier than my other pilcro stet jeans, but i love the wash and the broken-in wear on the upper legs and pocket. i mostly appreciate how little they stretch out during the day, just enough to be comfortable but without losing their shape. they seem a bit more fitted in the hips than the waist. but, i prefer jeans that aren't tight in the waist, so these are perfect for me. i purchased the same size as all my other jeans and they fit just fine. i am 5'6"" and the hem fell right",pos
"This top is very gorgeous and chic. it is very tight at the bottom, but i feel like it will stretch a little over time, it is also very long which i love, because it can be rouched up to a great length if you are curvy. both colors are great, i bought both and love both. the sizing was correct, if you want it to fit like it does on the model shot. if you want it a little more fitted, size down, but it may be very tight on the bottom. all in all i love them and they are definitely a great find fo",pos

Extremely well made tank top. great for work or a night out.,pos

I wish summer was longer so i could have the opportunity to wear this more. much more eye-catching and unique in person than the photo. 5 stars.,pos

"Really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner. the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different. it fits tts, but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress, which is nice. i am 5'9, 145 pounds, and the size 6 fit me perfectly.",pos
I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!,pos
"I had my eyes on this top ever since i saw it online. i couldn't be happier with it. it is very comfortable, flattering and unique. i think it will wear well into the fall with black skinnies.",pos
No only is this a beautiful update to a basic white top it is incredibly soft. i couldn't pass it up and wish it came in more colors!,pos
"True to size, very pretty.  as pictured expect that it is more peachy and not this light.  i like it and will keep it but just be aware that it is not a pale pink as in the picture.",pos
This is my go to top during the not so cold winter days.. can't be dressed up or down..,pos
"I just ordered this top and so far really like it, it is pretty and feminine and comfortable. the one thing i would note is that the lace running down the center has holes which you can see through, unlike the lace to each side. it's not extremely noticeable, but i am planning on wearing a cami under it. i ordered a small and it fits pretty well but is definitely on the looser side, i wonder if possibly the extra small would work for me, but i'm fairly tall so i went with the small.",pos
"I purchased this amazing tunic in-store in the plaid pattern, and couldn't be more thrilled with it. i can already see myself overwearing it, because it's so pretty and easy. i typically wear an xs, and sometimes petite styles. the regular small fits very well. i'm sure the xs would have been alright, but i like the way my forearms don't feel constricted where it buttons, and sizing up seemed to help with gaping by the button holes. i love the way this looks with a variety bottoms and shoes. it",pos
"I'm a power-walker. i bought this tank in 3 colors and rotate through them. they're great for working out with a nice sports bra underneath. i also wear them with leggings. so cute! love the colors, the fit. yes, they're thin. i don't think they'll last for years and years, but with the sale price they are such a great deal.",pos
"Such a cute skirt! the fabric is comfortable and light, and the the tie in the front helps conceal some of those ""tummy issues"" a lot of people want to hide. :)",pos
"I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was, however, pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side, noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much",pos
"Love this dress! it is tighter in the chest area than maybe expected, but not unwearable, though i am smaller chested. it will be great for hot summer days as it has a light lining.",pos
"These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome, and they even stay opaque when you sit, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!",pos
Purchased to speak at an event. not only is it very eye catching and i garnered many compliments it fit like it was made for me and was comfortable to wear. i questioned ordering a 4 and possibly could have worn a 6 but with the elasticity to the material there was no problem with movement or sitting and i felt hugged in in all the right places!,pos
"I had been eyeing this sweater since it came in for the fall mostly because of the beautiful purple color. it finally went on sale and i scooped it up. like most reviewers, i luv that you can wear it two ways. i prefer to wear it closed as i do not have the slimmest waist and this sweater hides this well but it looks just as good open and drapes well on the sides. this sweater looks a lot better in person than online like most of the retailer sweaters. i have hand washed this a couple times alread",pos
"Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement",neg
"When i first saw this in the retailer catalog, i thought it was beautiful. i am a sucker for floral prints, and unique color combinations, both of which this top has. i'm 5'3"", 120 lbs and a small bust at 32b, i usually wear a size 2 but it was a little loose all around so i'd say it runs big. they had the size 2 at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation. it's a little loose but very flattering and very good quality, i definitely recommend it if your shape is s",pos
"This is my favorite shirt ever. i've had it for years and it still looks great. please, please bring it back!!",pos
Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described. color and fit was spot on! thank you!,pos
I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,neg
"Cute in theory, i love the bright colors, the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe, however, the fabric is cheap, and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional, but with the shirt i received, it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam, so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on",neg
"I have been stalking these pants since they first showed up on retailer's site. i have never even tried on anything like this before though, so have been waiting patiently for a review to get an idea of what they might look like, fit like...etc sale plus 30% off was incentive to take the plunge without a review though. i am wearing them right now and they are so comfortable and pretty and just...everything summer. perfect!!!! i am not a ""shorts"" person, generally wear skirts and dresses. these are",pos
Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.,neg
"This is a lovely, romantic skirt that hangs nicely. it is lined except for the ruffle on the bottom. as others have said, the waistband is stretchy and molds to your shape. it is high waisted. i called the store to hold a size 4 and 6 for me to try. when i got there, i finally settled on a size 2, so it runs a bit large. i have a 25 inch waist and 36 inch hips. if this fits your style, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",pos
"I am very particular about jeans. it's not just the look; it;s the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over. the mid-rise wide-leg crop is perfection. i'm 5'7"" and a size 8. these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel. great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well. i highly recommend.",pos
"I bought this dress to use for maternity photos and it is perfect! i love the flow of the skirt and the elastic waistband worked perfect. i was able to fit in a size 2 (normally a size 0) so i hope to be able to wear it after pregnancy as well. i was worried about the bust area being too small, and while it's a tight fit for me currently it still worked.",pos
"I think this is adorable and am so excited to have bought it. it is really flattering. i love how it hangs-- it's loose enough without being unflattering at all. it's a little retro. it feels really soft! i hope it holds up well. 
i'm 5'1 and and 103. i got an xs and it fits perfectly.",pos
"Love the fit of this dress! i'm 5'2"" 120 and the petite extra small fits perfectly. the waist is slimming and the cut is not too low. also great pattern.",pos
"I love love love this top. i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often. i think it's feminine, chic, and classic. i've worn it several times and i each time i've had more than one person comment on it. i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large. the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves. i usually just unbutton those anyway so no",pos
"I'm usually a small or medium in retailer tops, however, jackets i tend to wear a small......liking a more fitted look. this jacket i also purchased a small, but there is plenty of room, so might have even worn an xs. anyway, the material is great, is well made, wonderful pocketsi, super comfy, but maybe a little too warm for summer nights. i cuffed up the sleeves......had no issue with the length. i'm 5'6"", 36c and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. happy mother's day to me!",pos
I am very happy with this shirt. i don't like skin tight clothes. i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack. it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots. i love the way it flows while i walk. very flattering on. would definitely recommend!,pos
"This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size.",pos
"I loved this jacket! it's exactly what i was looking for. i set out to find a lightweight sweater or jacket that would keep me warm and also versatile enough to wear with different outfits. this definitely fit the bill! in addition, it's really soft and not at all itchy, which was a concern i had since it was wool and i ordered it online. i have received a bunch of compliments! i definitely recommend it!",pos
"This sweater is beautifully detailed, however, it seems too spring like to be for sale before christmas. very pretty. the cut may not be for everyone. it is like a peplum on the bottom and looks best open, as shown, on my busty top (36d) it seems cut slightly large but i am keeping my usual size medium. i'll keep for early spring! colors are as shown, detail better in person.",pos
"I got this shirt as a gift. it's cute and very comfortable. it is,however, a little thin so you may need to wear something underneath.",pos
"I love love love these white jeans. the crop style is great as i am 5'1"", so the fit is perfect for an ankle jean.
these fit the bill in every way. they are so comfy!",pos
"Love this shirt...got it in the ""blue"" but i will say the print is a very dark navy, almost black. i'm 130 lbs, 34d and the size 6 fit me fine. so i would disagree with other reviews that says it runs large. this is perfect to hide muffin tops with the slight swing style that has a little flair!",pos
"Omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it. i tried it on and fell madly in love! i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world. it is soft and cozy. comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam. its almost sold out already, so grab it if you can cuz its divine! does run a little big, so i got a 0 instead of a 2 and its perfect.",pos
"I love camisoles like this, and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length, so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted, but not tight.",pos
"A little more see-through than you would think, but has super cute smaller details! also needs to be ironed, a lot.",pos
"I love this shirt, love love love it. i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hidden.
but i've owned it for 6 months and there are already 4 holes in the shirt. and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines. the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart. the whole point is to be able to wear it. but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again. :(",neg
Fabric much heavier than looks in picture. also nothing mentioned in the description. great color and fit but i live in florida.,neg
"Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.",pos
This is so awesome. i love how it fits. it's great quality. it's flattering. it's casual but put together. love. fits true to size. i bought it in white as well.,pos
"I know it's for warm weather, but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall/ winter. i bought 2 sizes a 4 & 6, because i wasn't sure on size. the 6 was way big on me, but the boxy cut of the 4 left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath.",pos
"So bummed. i was really hoping this top would work for me. i got the black in regular size 4 and the pink in petite size 4. both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section. i have a sort of short torso, wear a small 34c, and am have a defined waist. when tops are bulky, it gives me no shape and just looks terrible. i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure. they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck out.

Love this chinos.  they fit tts and the blue is vibrant.  bought them in pink too.  for reference i am 5&amp;amp;amp;#39;5&amp;amp;amp;quot; and weigh 122 lbs and bought size 27.  the fit is a bit slouchy much like in the photos.,pos
It was love at first sight. the only problem was that it didn't come in my size. i took a chance and order a size smaller and it worked out great. its a great item that can be worn in the spring and fall. exactly what i was looking for.,pos
"This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2"". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.",neg
"I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect! i am 5' 8"" and weigh 145 pounds with an approximate 10"" difference between hips and waist. the size 27 fit perfectly. i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen. they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening. they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron. i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey!",pos
"These jeans really look very nice on. they are 99% cotton and 1% elastaine. if you want the look that you see on this model, order one size up. i am 5'9""/136 lbs. bought both 27 and 28. decided to keep the 28. mainly because the lower part of the leg was fitting too tight in the 27, looked more like a skinny jean but bunched up at the knee -- they are tapered. (i also own a pair of 100% cotton levi's wedgie in foot hills in size 27 which fit a bit different than these -- the foot hills definitel",pos
"The neck is so big on this sweater, i couldn't make it lay right. the shape of the sweater is odd. it is really wide on the upper torso, but tapers near your waist. it did not look as depicted on the model. the sweater is a lovely color, i liked the two-tone, but overall the fit was too weird for me. material is soft and it felt really nice on, but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck.",neg
"Love this dress! the colors are a smidgen darker than the photo shows, which i like even better. super comfortable, nice flow, great fit. definitely will be a favorite of mine for this summers",pos
"First of all, the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad, but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.

at any rate, i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing. in the summers, i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t",pos
"This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.

the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.",neg
"I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package. it's a very vibrant print in the red print, almost a picnic vibe, and the material feels soft and high quality. it runs very large though, i usually take an 8 or maybe a 6, and am busty, and in this i am pretty sure i will need the 4. i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on! but i will return the 8 and get the 4 in the red, as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much.",pos
"I was looking for something to wear on jeans fridays. this tunic is super cute and looks great with jeggings. i did find the sizing small for me, but i am busty.",pos
"Dress is so comfortable. great for town or resort. 5'7"" size 6 34a and i got a size small.",pos
"I disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy. i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online. i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i wore it with black skinny jeans, black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket, and did not keep on the entire night. i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in. :) i really love it. maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change",pos
"Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight, while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6"" and the size 6 is perfect for me.",pos
"I'm so excited that retailer is bringing back some of the gorgeous fabrics and details they used to have. the all over embroidary is beautiful, the cotton/silk blend is delicious, and there's enough shaping that the top doesn't look too boxy. i did end up sizing down for a slightly more fitted loo and for a smaller armhole. i also picked through a couple of tops to find the one i wanted, since the embroidery pattern wasn't centered on some of them.",pos
Love this turtleneck! it's perfect for fall and to layer. i'm usually an xs in things from retailer and this is no different. i definitely recommend.,pos
"Love, love, love this jacket! i'm able to dress it up or casual. the hint from a review i read to button the lapels back worked awesome. good quality, has a bit of stretch for bulky shirt to wear underneath. would definitely recommend if like the military jacket style.",pos
"Love this vest! since i am 66 years old i was hesitant to try on this vest because it was out of my comfort zone as to style, but my daughter convinced me to try it on. it is absolutely darling and looked so chic on. my 27 year old daughter bought it, too, so it is stylish for any age. the fur collar is fun and the fabric is very nice and the vest is well made. it can elevate jeans to a dressier look but still have a casual vibe. having a coupon the day we shopped made the decision to buy this e",pos
"I love the weight of the material; sometimes crinkled gauze looks cheap; this does not. the lace trim is more 2-tone than the photo suggests, but that is not negative, and the color of the dress is more salmon than peach, again, not a negative. the length is as it is on the model, just below the knee. i wore it to what turned out to be surprise party for me at the beach! i paired it with huge silver hoops and silver flipflops. i felt special, stylish and comfortable. it was a good dress for some",pos
"I am mad for plaid--this dress is my new favorite!! why? i'll tell you!! the picture online does not do it justice, but you must add a belt. the dress is cut lower in the front, but has a great stitch to keep it from gaping open over my d cup chest. the material is soft and breathable. the xsp was perfect for my 5'2"" frame, my typical size.",pos
"The material is velvety smooth, and not quite so pink as pictured on the website. more of a dusty brown rose. well made, nice fit. flattering on my petite frame. a wonderful third piece to complete or elevate an outfit.",pos
"I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned.",neg
"I tried this skirt on in the store, it fit like a glove (that doesn't happen very often for me) but couldn't find the right top to pair w/ it so i passed on it, but when i got home i found the perfect top already in my closet! so, i ordered it online, it doesn't seem to lay quite as nice as the one i tried on in the store, but i'm keeping it regardless. highly recommended this skirt! fits tts.",pos
"This is a gorgeous shirt. it actually looks more fitted on than in this picture, where it looks more shapeless. even though i love tunics, the online picture wasn't appealing to me -- but when i saw the shirt in store and tried it on i loved it. wore it to work today and loved it even more. it's great quality, gorgeous design, lovely tailoring and details throughout.",pos
"I ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise, it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern, interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals, and the gray and beige look good together too.",pos
"Since there isn't one where i live, i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s, and yes, it's a tad large on me, but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.",pos
"I love this blouse! it's very flattering- gives the illusion of an hourglass shape. the fabric feels soft and flowy, and the pattern is pretty; it does need a camisole underneath because it's kinda sheer. it does run small! i usually wear a size 0 in retailer clothes, but i bought a size 2 in this shirt and the sleeves are still very snug around my forearms which is unusual for me.",pos
"I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6"" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them.",pos
"I have this sweater in ivory and raspberry. it's gorgeous. holds up well on had wash cycle also. it's so flattering. i'm so so happy i bought theses. i am 5'8"", athletic build and a normal medium, this runs large. i bough smalls.",pos
"I just bought these jeans today & they are really cute & comfortable on. i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well, they are made well & they are always on style. i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully! comfy & stylish!",pos
"This is the perfect dress to transition into fall, either dressing it up with wedges or down with a leather jacket. i have never purchased this brand, ranna gill, but needed to size up which is rare for me when i shop at retailer. it is comfortable and lightweight. i marked it down one star on quality because for the price, i have already noticed some of the black lace stitching coming undone.",pos
"Nice light weight fabric, drapes well.  awesome detailing.  have worn twice already with lots of compliments.",pos
I saw this top and loved the pattern. meadow rue is one of my favorite brands for tops at retailer. the pattern is lovely and the fit it tts. this top is comfortable for running errands and can be dressed up too. very versatile for spring.,pos
"This skirt has a more dusty black background than the website lets on, which i love. the floral pattern is delicate and subtle, and the tiers give this gorgeous skirt the perfect amount of flounce. it is so versatile! the quality is excellent. the skirt is fully lined. it will take me easily through three seasons (the weight of it might make it a bit too warm for summer). i'm so happy i bought this!",pos
"I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4"", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha",pos
"I love this dress; however, b/c of my broad shoulders i need to size up. i would say if you have a straight and slender frame then it's tts. the bottam half was fine it was a tad bit snug around the arm pits for me. it is very cute for spring summer. it is sold out.",pos
"I got the small petite and this fits beautifully, as on the model (i am 5'2""). i do think that it flatters a flat belly more than it would flatter a fatter one! it would certainly hide any belly, but the drape works best if you're streamlined, i imagine. if you've got a tapering torso, go for it! depending on your bust, you may want to pin the overlapped fabric just to be sure of hiding the bottom of your bra. not that i've found it a problem.",pos
"Super light and soft. haven't worn it out but expect to wear with jeans. it will be cute and comfy. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs and bought a small, fits well.",pos
"Omg i am absolutely in love with this dress, i saw it on line and knew immediately that i had to have it! i decided to go into the store to try it and it looks even better on than it did on the website. the a-line shape is very flattering and the retro pattern and colors are amazing! the only down side if there even is on is that it is a little tight across the chest but i am a 36ddd so sometimes that happens, i just took a large rather than my usual medium. other than that, this dress is my fav",pos

"This is a beautiful blouse and well made!!! i read the previous reviews and i'm usually between sizes 8 and 10, so i sized-up, and ordered size 12 and it fits well. i purchased the pink, and it's soo pretty! i'm very satisfied with my purchase, and i highly recommend this blouse.",pos
"I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss, copper and burgundy. they are soft, well-fitting, pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material, and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better, but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials, this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.",neg
"Love, love, love these leggings! a soft, colorful, comfortable way to show your artistic flare.",pos
"This skirt is a real ""dress up"" piece. it is simply stunning and indeed appears to have been designed by an artist. the aqua blue lining adds a definite pop of color while the shimmering knit outer layer is simply lovely. i plan to wear it out to dinner with friends this weekend and know that i will receive lots of compliments",pos
"Lovely dress, but i would recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally do.",pos
This shirt is super soft and comfortable! luckily it's a good length and not at all short!,pos
"This dress is light, airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan. 
this dress is a keeper!",pos
"This is such a cute dress, and i don't know why know one has reviewed it yet. its different and fun, i have worn it to work once and have gotten several compliments on it. i found that it does run a bit short so i wore it with leggings.",pos

more dressy than what it appears in photo",pos
"I saw this today and decided to try it on, it fit perfectly! i have a generous bosom 36e, and a large fit without gaping or the button issues a previous reviewer noted. the fabric is comfortable, no itching. too bad it's 90 degrees, i'm ready to wear this.",pos
"A friend of mine has several of these jackets and i always asked ""where did you find that from?"" the answer? retailer vegan leather jackets! i bought 2 when they were on sale and i love both (grey and dark brown/purple). they are super comfy and surprisingly warm. can dress up or dress down for any occasion. i can't wait to buy more!",pos
Way too long...the sizing is incredibly off on this product. order a size or two down.,neg
"I bought this jacket in a regular and returned it to the store where they had a petite, it is lovely.  i live in ca so it is perfect for an evening out.... remember not to buy this for warmth but a light cover up.  it makes an outfit out of anything else you might want to wear.  looks great with black under it or off white.... also looks great with the beautiful soft pinks that are out this season... or cranberry.... you will love it...",pos
"I ordered this shirt in the xl in both colors and i am in love! as a large chested lady, with a bit extra around the middle, this shirt is super flattering and perfect for everyday summer weather. i'm sure i will be wearing this all summer. yay retailer!",pos
"This sweater is so much cuter than the online picture makes it look! i think the model is wearing it too large. anyway, this runs kind of big, so size down. it's kind of short in the front, but it hits at a nice, flattering spot. love it.",pos
"This dress is gorgeous! the color is perfect for spring/summer. the dress does run wide/loose. i read reviews before ordering and i am glad that i did. i am usually a petite size, but the reviews recommended going with the regular due to length and the design at the bottom (and wanting to be able to bend over comfortably). i am 5'2 and about 116lbs. i ordered the 2 regular and it worked well. i received many compliments!",pos
"I love, love, love this top! the color is beautiful, a pinkish-orange, about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big, i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2, i'm almost 5'7"" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first, once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely, so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning,",pos
"I noticed some reviewers didn't like the loose shape of the dress. it is indeed a dress with a looser silhouette than most! but that's what makes it unique and expensive looking! i loved the extra material in the dress, especially in the back, it flowed gracefully and beautifully. i can imagine wearing this dress for many occasions and feeling instantly chic with minimal effort! :) it was also very figure flattering! i ordered the size l and it was a perfect knee length, so i would say this dres",pos
"I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern, but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off. i tried them on and loved them! they will be perfect summer pants because they're so light and not clingy at all. the material is great. these will also be really fun to wear at the beach. i could stand for them to be about an inch longer, but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length. definitely worth trying o",pos
"I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black. not this one! this is truly b&w! i love the stripes, the length (at the knee, 5'5"") and the pockets! time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable. the collar seems to stay down which makes it look 70's but fabric tape easily fixed it. overall, i love it!",pos
"These photos do not do the vest any justice. i randomly saw this in the sale section at my local retailer. tried it on and it was super cute, but i did the whole ""walk away, maybe you'll forget about it"" thing. that did not happen. i ran back to retailer on my lunch break the next day, and thank goodness, there was still one left in my size. it actually drapes in a flattering way, and it looks polished. it's so versatile. i would not have looked for this vest based on these photos, but i'm telling y",pos
Received this in the mail today and was disappointed. i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all. the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body. needless to say i will be returning this item,neg
"Comfortable casual, hip. i have the black & white color which is a bit thicker than the other colors which i prefer as i recently had a baby and need a little extra fabric. i wish the fabric was a bit softer but the cut is so flattering there was no way i was sending it back. i wish the other colors were in the same thicker fabric and i would have ordered more. my new go to top. the black ribbon on the back is my favorite part.",pos
"I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here....this has to be the best thing i've ever purchased. it is so soft and beautiful. i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ...fits perfectly and doesn't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing. it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that's so perfect, a little different and not a defect. it is not itchy whats so ever. i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo",pos
"I loved this skirt. so flattering and such a beautiful fabric. unfortunately after only 2 wears, the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me (literally). i bought the right size and it was not too tight. the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly. very disappointing.",neg
Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.,pos
"I bought these pants online in blue, and loved them so much that i bought them in the bronze two days later. very flattering fit, comfortable, great quality, and i look and feel like a class act wearing them. they're a bit of a looser taper style of fit, but that's just the style, and i've received so many compliments on them!",pos
"It runs large but thats okay, its great quality and super super soft! i love the way it makes you feel so comfortable. very disappointed the clip fell off.",pos
"Oh what a disappointment! i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan. the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam. so, back it goes. and, i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost $60 for this top!",neg
"I purchased the purple t with letters all over. great fit, long and not clingy at all. i love the 80's motif/style of the letters. perfect t-shirt for a teacher.
the black design was strange - hearts, fox, cats... it just seemed random and no theme. i would buy colors of this t-shirt because it fits so well, but the black ""green"" design was too off.",pos
"I have been waiting for this poncho to hit my local retailer.  it was as good as it looks online. the perfect piece to put on over a tank or t-shirt. you can dress it up or down and i love that it has pockets. i wear a 10 and i bought the m/l, this is meant to be oversized so buy appropriately.",pos
"Wow, this sweater is, as other reviewers have said, perfect weight and the colors are vibrant and will work well with fall colors! i'm 5'11"" so i'm always hoping the length works and in this case it does! i am very happy with this!",pos
"The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made. unfortunately, the fit was enormous. i've an athletic build w/ big boobs & normally wear l in retailer tops.",neg
"This top is so pretty and festive. i am purchasing it for a holiday party. i debated between a m and l, but went with the m, and i'm glad i did. it is generously sized. finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky. i'm thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown.",pos
"I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.",neg
"This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous. everything about this skirt works: dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length. the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way, and super comfortable. no petite 2 left so i purchased a regular 2 and it fits perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls about 2in. longer than shown on the model. this skirt is sold out fast, no surprise. it flatters all body types at all ages. get ready for lots of compliments!",pos
"Ag is my go-to brand for comfortable, high quality jeans. these fit the bill!",pos
I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.,pos
"This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts, i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on, i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.",neg
"I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big, but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!",pos
"I'm surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet! i've had it for a couple of months and love it! it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf. the color is beautiful...i've gotten many compliments on this too. it fits well and has a small texture, which makes it more interesting.",pos
"As in previous reviews, this top can be worn in many ways. it could even be used as a pretty bathing suit cover-up. i like it with my cropped cotton spandex leggings which i have in many solid colors. i plan to wear it unbuttoned with my classic style spandex tanks i have in various colors & prints. the complete look says 'summer' & feels cool & comfy in this warm weather. even hubby loves the look! 5'3"", 117#. i bought my usual size small.",pos
If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves. i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut.,pos
"I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray, not white. either i got a strange one or (as happens to me sometimes with retailer) the pictures are very misleading. disappointed because i wanted to love this.",neg
"I really wanted to not like the top for that price, but ti looks really good, the beading makes the shirt stunning... i ordered the 0p, not sure what size to get, and it is just fine. the length is almost too short, but isn't. the rest of the shirt fits nicely. the shoulder are wide, like poofing out a bit, perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large? the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer, but not crazy. debating whether to keep it but right now i love it. also, teh colla",pos
"I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .",pos
"I was on the fence about ordering this jacket, but i'm so glad i did. i got my birthday discount to help afford it. as the first reviewer said, the weight is substantial, but not too heavy, and the embroidery is beautiful! i have not worn this jacket yet, but i expect to get many compliments when i do! i usually don't wear jackets in this style, so it's a fresh, new approach for me....the embroidery takes it to the next level! it fits true to size. i usually take a medium, and the medium fits pe",pos
"I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!",neg
"I like this sweater for its classic shape and grosgrain ribbon finish on the placket. it does have buttons all the way down and they are a little hard to open but the style is fun and fresh. it will dress up or down as shown with jeans and tee shirt. fit is like on the model for me in a large as i usually wear a 10-12 on top. the arms are quite long even for me at 5'9"".",pos
"Loved it online for its modern cut and print. however, when i received the item i was disappointed. i ordered my usual size 4 and i was swimming in it. i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way; however, this was not flattering. i would say i would have needed to size down to a 0 and perhaps it would work but i didn't want to take another chance. the material seemed almost crepey, which i wasn't neccissarily expecting either. bummer that it didn't work out.",neg
"The catalog shot and model shot are completely different. it's like not even the same dress. the neckline, color, the quality of lace",neg
"I bought a size s in the navy, and m in the neutral, and both fit. i usually wear a small, but they only had the size m left in the neutral. the m is a little big, but the extra room fits the flowy, bohemian style of the blouse, so it works. i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors. definitely recommend it.",pos
"Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy, too.",pos
These pants are so fun! i use them to sleep in as they are see through. i had to size up as the waist band gave me muffin top. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large.,pos
"This is my new favorite dress! i can't tell you how flattering it is. i just had a baby a few months ago, and it's the only piece of clothing i actually feel like i look like my old, pre-baby self in! i'm on the shorter side (5'3""#, very busty #because i'm nursing# and about 118 lbs. i got a mp and it fits great. i could have gotten the small, but i feel that would have been too low cut. honestly, love the cut, the pattern, everything about it. would buy again!",pos
"Just as breathtaking in person . . . and in a totally comfortable, soft, stretch fabric. i'm 5' 8"" 120 lbs. 34b; purchased the size 0 and 2 for comparison; decided on size 2 as the size 0 was really tight in the chest area--meant only for the tiniest! the dress is long on me and i'll likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the knees--but i'm grateful it's too long (something i can fix) rather than being too short.",pos
I love how it fits very flattering! the quality of the cotton part of this top is a little less in quality of that fabric than i expected. but i love this top and i foresee wearing it all year round!,pos
"This dress pops! gorgeous colors and simple, classic flowy design. i thought it ran a little big, i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow. 34b for reference.",pos
"I disagree with the other review. i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailer-model. the sweater knit is lighter weight, it is not heavy. it fits more tightly to the body, which i like. the material is soft to me and navy color has a gray-tone to it. i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all. if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you. if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y",pos
"I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie, this item was too small, especailly across the bust. it was very well-made and the color green is beautiful, but unfortunately, i will not be able to wear it. so disappointed.",neg
"I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and it is a stunner! really one of the most gorgeous dresses i've ever owned. it is very very fancy and really i'd say most appropriate for a black tie event, an evening wedding or a mother of the bride or groom. superb quality... just amazing! i have a few bryon lars dresses and this one seems to run about true to size. the others i own seem to run a little large.",pos
"I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!",pos
"I saw this skirt online and loved the vibrant colors, pattern, and style. it looks even prettier in person. the material is light and soft. the skirt is fully lined so you don't have to worry about it being see-through. also, the skirt is a good length for me and won't drag on the floor. happy with purchase. recommend.",pos
"I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!",neg
The sweater is very soft. it has an interesting pattern. i purchased the neutral color in size xs which runs tts. it's definitely a cozy sweater to wear this winter.,pos
"The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on, however the material is thin and slightly see through.
also, after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear. after the third time i wore it, i discovered a large hole in the armpit, most likely due to the excessive washing. i would not recommend this sweater.",neg
This dress fits great. i love that it's fitted at the top but drapery and swingy at the bottom.  it has a thicker t-shirt type fabric.  i will definitely style this with a variety of necklaces or a scarf and cardigan for cooler weather.  it's much cuter in person.  for reference i'm 5'4 105 and got xs.,pos
"Rec'd so many compliments on this.  absolutely beautiful, comfortable and versatile.  try it with white crops and cute heels!",pos
I absolutely love this blouse...i ordered it in peach..then waited for the raspberry to come back in my size...now i have 2 colors...it runs really large....but putting a tank or cami underneath is fun :-),pos
"I love this dress and am strongly considering buying the white, too, but i wish it came in another color other than white or black, because i would get that. goes great for nice dinners, dates, weddings, almost anything. it's not ball-gown fancy, but just fitted and nice enough to wear for work or a nice evening out. only problem i have are with the clips in the front. i have a hard time using the loo because it is very fitted, you have to un clip them and then re-clip, but it's worth the effort",pos
"This top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person. the neckline is very high, which was a surprise for a summer tank, but it's cut well. nice surprise: on seem pockets! wore it today for the first time and received many comments. a keeper. fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top.",pos
"I love this sweater. it's warm, comfortable, and soft. nice quality too.",pos
Great long cardigan! i wear this with a simple tank,pos
"Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun",pos
"I have featured a picture below. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. i ordered an xs petite. i'm pretty busty so i don't like a loose fitting top, so ordering a size down did the trick. it's super soft, one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element. i'm enjoying wearing the top.",pos
It's a perfect maternity dress but i love that i will still be able to wear it with a belt once the baby comes.,pos
I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could,neg
These jeans look better in person - the pattern is more subtle than the picture online. these run true to size for ag denim.,pos

Great pants! great fall colors. great for day or night. super fun and funky. love them!,pos
"I love how comfortable this dress is! i ordered an xs and it fit perfectly (i'm 5' 4"" and it falls to just above my knee). it holds its shape and is very flattering. pair it with a cute denim jacket and ankle boots for fall, or a light scarf and ballet flats for spring!",pos
Another tent-like tee. this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice. but...it is really boxy and i'm just tired of that look. the longer sleeves are a plus for fall.,neg
"I was considering this online for days before a ladies lunch date meandered into a brick & mortar location. i had been thinking of sizing up, if i ordered online, just to be sure it wouldn't be too tight or awkward, and when i had looked for it in stores nearby, it was out of stock, but i hadn't thought to look for my tts, which happened to be available in the store where i went. i tried it on, because i was so curious, and it worked!! i love it. it is so easy-breezy. it will be perfect to layer",pos
"I've been wanting to try on this dress since it popped up online, we visited san francisco this weekend & i finally got my chance. it fit great & was flattering! i am currently pregnant & it worked with my growing belly but will also look good when i do not have a belly. i would definitely recommend! <3",pos
I found this jumpsuit at my local retailer it must have been a web order return i love it the fit is true size the colors are perfect it's very comfortable and gorgeous on and at the sale price i could not pass it up,pos
"This is such a great top - it can be easily dressed up or down. i love my tops flowy, and this is just that! i have a larger chest (34d) and the flowy nature of it keeps it from being too short up front. even though it has eyelits in it, it can be worn without a cami underneath as long as you wear a good nude bra. it'll be a great sweater for all seasons. i'm even able to wear it to work. highly highly recommend.",pos
"Love! i am 5'3"" 118lbs with short legs and a long torso. i was worried these would be too long....they fit to perfection! super excited about this purchase",pos
"Beautiful color, great quality! on sale too. a must have!",pos
"I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!",pos
"I was a little hesitant to order this, thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong. this shirt is super cute and comfy. it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering. my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up, ankle jeans and my fave oxfords. i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and went with the size 4 regular",pos
"Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily.",pos
Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.,neg
I feel like a pessimist but then again nothings perfect. the only thing wrong with this stunning sweater is no button or snap so it just bags open. love it tho,pos
"This skirt arrived today and i love it. the fabric is substantial and can be worn in the fall and maybe even on a mild california winter day. i plan on wearing it with tights and/or boots. the fabric will go with a variety of colored tops and sweaters. it's not ""pull on styling"". it has a side zipper. fits true to size, but is longer on me than the model, but then i am pretty short. got this on sale!!",pos
I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!,pos
This top fits great. maybe a tad on the large side but not enough to go down a size. i love the fit. the bell sleeves and peplum are so flattering. definitely worth the price too!,pos
"I just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet, i've been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale. i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it. it fits like it was made just for me. the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem, the second layer is form fitting and soft. i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down, like a lady and take in my surroundings, after all life",pos
"Hesitated to try it on because it was ""t-shirt dress"" and my experience has been that fabric is unforgiving for dimples or imperfections   i was wrong with this one. it's great!  color is nice. fabric looks textured bc of the dye. the neck line is perfect (i like a lower v) and the length is great bc of the side slits. i tried it on with the front panel knotted at the bottom (how it was on the hanger) and i love it.  had to get. can dress up or down, but i'd say this has mostly a casual feel.",pos
"I love almost all tops from retailer, however this one was just enormous. it is beautifully designed, but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldn't believe it was sized 0. i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size 0 tag on an xl shirt. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i would have loved this shirt if it hadn't been so big.",neg
"I love this top...i waited for it to go on sale, and it was well worth it. it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back. i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up, the arms do run a little tight. overall, the mock neck, button closure on the back, and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look",pos
"Fits large, wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price.",neg
"Wanted to love this top, and could imagine lots of outfits with it. the wide shoulders made my arms/shoulders look big. the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place, accentuating my belly. it did arrive very wrinkled, although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment. maybe that made the look worse. overall i felt that it made me look 15 lbs heavier than i am, so back it goes. i am 5'7"", 160lbs, 34dddd, and the size large was the correct size.",neg
I bought the orange color and the pattern is absolutely beautiful. the fabric and style is very flattering and comfortable. well worth it. runs true to size (i am usually an xsmall 134 lbs 34 c and the xsmall fit perfect). perfect summer dress: soft fabric and light.,pos

"I tried this dress at the store today and couldn't leave without it. also tried the pacquerette shirtdress which has a similar boho/peasant vibe and overall preferred the fit and look of this one. plus, its lined, which the paquerette shirtdress is not for the same price. fit was very similar to the anwen peasant dress, which i also have, and the regular size xs fit me much the same as in that dress. it is maybe 1 inch longer though, but still that makes it a couple of inches above the knee for",pos
"I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5"" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.",neg
"Another maeve maxi to add to my crowded closet! i adore the print, it reminds me of morocco. i went with my usual m based on reviews about the waistband. i will have to disagree as i should have chosen s instead. i'm not going to return it, but i think this will really stretch out because of the knit and weight of the jersey.",pos
"The pictures online do not do this jacket justice. i saw it hanging in the store and had to have it, even before i tried it on. it's extremely versatile, worn as shown, as a layered look, or the zipped ""liner"" is can be removed and this can be worn as a simple blazer. it's the perfect weight for spring/fall. it's fitted, and so cute. this jacket runs true to size (not large). i usually wear a 4 and the small fit perfectly.",pos

What a great find! this is so easy to dress up or down and a very comfortable fit and fabric. the skirt fabric is pretty form fitting so not something i can comfortably wear to work but it's a versatile piece otherwise. the buttons on the sleeve are a nice touch.,pos
"So.. i saw this dress like a month ago and i fell in love. utter i-have-to-have-it love. before dropping $200 superfast, i gave myself some time to think it over. well, of course i decided to order it, and of course my size was sold out. most of the sizes were sold out, actually. they did have a petite left, so after i dried my eyes, i decided to wing it. the petite actually fit. the mid section is a little snugger than i am normally comfortable with (although the top is so structured that it ac",pos

Starts out crisp but not too tight. doesn't over-stretch through the course of the day. very comfortable but looks polished. front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans: good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans. washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness; which is good because being white they pick up stains easily. be careful with underwear lines- thong probably best.,pos

"Stumbled upon this dress which had been returned to a store and was encouraged to try it on by the sales staff, and am glad i did. it's a beautiful dress that i didn't need and have no idea what i will wear it for, but bought anyway. i got a size 8 and it fits perfectly though i will need to shorten it a bit. i am busty and prefer a bit more coverage so will add more tulle to the v neck. i agree with the other reviewer about the tulle underlay but it looks easy enough to remove from the lining o",pos
"Is this dress ever flattering! i have seen many variations of this kind of dress-some where they will kris-cross over the breast area, some where they will have a single twist-but i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh, what a difference it makes. i particularly love this in blue-which was a very bright royal color in-store. i am not very chesty, so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love.",pos
I love this gown so much. i have two of them! the gray and pink. they are really soft and comfortable. i sleep in them all of the time.,pos

"When i saw this dress i knew i had to have it! i loved the colors and design. i am a wedding planner and dresses with pockets are my ""uniform""

Love this top - it's flattering and perfect for a casual dinner out or running around on a saturday afternoon. super comfortable and very cute.,pos
"Retailer is totally killing my wallet because i can't resist these modern-city-meets-prairie-boho dresses. i bow down to the textile designers who created this print, it's stunning. as for reality vs. model shoot, it's pretty much what you see--the colors are spot on, the outer dress is sheer, the bodice is slightly fitted, with a fuller skirt that doesn't poof too much. all poly construction with no stretch whatsoever. i had a bit of a struggle getting the outer dress over my shoulders but once a",pos
I love this dress! it is equally pretty in person too. sometimes i will order things and when i get them the colors are totally different than what i anticipated. not with this dress. i love it and will get a lot of use out of it over the spring/summer.,pos
"I saw these in the sale section on line and just loved their look. they fit great and have a cute little flare at the bottom. i like the reinforced inside seams which means they will last longer. i've been wearing them with my shorter boots and booties this winter. i have slim legs and they aren't too tight and not too loose. my inseam is a 33 so they may be a tad short on me, but i love them.",pos
"I really wanted to love these, i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap. they were a little long and didn't quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine. i was told they wouldn't stretch out much. well, they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i can't get them to shrink. wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean. too late to return, so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans.",neg
This cut and shape of this skirt is very flattering. i am normally a medium but the small fit and looked much better- less bulky. the material is nice almost sweater like but not so heavy. it's a very versatile skirt. highly recommend.,pos
"This is a beautiful sweater/tunic/dress. i ordered in the mustard color, and wearing it will brighten my day on a dreary winter morning. it is so hard to find winter clothes in bright colors. the sweater is soft and not itchy. it is a bit longer than i expected...maybe 35"" (i am 5'7""), but that is just fine! it can be worn with leggings or tights. dressed up or dressed down. i couldn't be more pleased.",pos
"This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look ""thick"". highly recommend!",pos
This dress is perfect. it's ridiculously soft (i felt like i was wearing pajamas) and it fits perfectly. the quality is great; well worth your purchase.,pos
"I received this top today and though the color is not white as shown in the pic, it's a beautiful top. its more ivory as mentioned. the lace is like a lining(covering the entire body except the arms) underneath the ribbed fabric. like the other reviewer mentioned the lace is not itchy but soft and very pretty! i totally love it!!! this is my new favorite top in my wardrobe!!",pos
This cardigan is defined by comfort. it is of a lovely knitted like material and is very warm. the pockets are great for holding your phone and the billowy sleeves make you feel like you are wrapped in a blanket.,pos

great color, versatile (i.e. work, weekend). fun accent piece to shield yourself from a brisk wind, while maintaining full fashion status. 
my first day wearing and i've rec'd many compliments. love the combo of trench coat and poncho. my one issue...i wish the sleeve strap actually buckled, it keeps slipping out of the faux buckle and i'm afraid i'm going to lose it. i usually wear a medium/size 10, but medium was sold out, so i ordered",pos
A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!,pos
Love the way this feels ? epic and flowy and flattering ? and features my shoulders and de-emphasizes shape and size from waist down. waited for it to go on sale and it paid off. i'm wearing it to a wedding this weekend. i can't wait to show it off! highly recommended.,pos
"Love, love, love this top!!!  love the ruffled tiers at the bottom.  love the longer length. the top does indeed run large.  normally i'm between a medium and small but bought the xs.  love the pockets.  the orange color seems like a nicer fabric, and is versatile with both jeans and leggings.",pos
I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!,neg

I bought this to use over the holidays. it is extremely comfortable and i've received multiple complements. you can dress it up or wear it casual.,pos
These pants are beautiful. the color is a nice deep red. pretty color for fall and the wide legs are very complimentary for athletic thigh women like myself. my only regret is listening to the other reviewer. these pants run true to size. i am normally a 0p in elevenses and should of stayed with that but went for a 00 because of the review claiming they run small. the waist is accurate sizing. the only thing running big on these pants are the width of the legs and that should be expected from th,pos
"So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews, they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly, too. there are weird fading marks all over, even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely",neg
"This is a sweet little jacket. i saw it in the store but was unsure because of the price. but after trying it on, i just fell in love! the cut is really flattering. the jacket does run small. i really enjoy the little pop of color on the sleeves. my only complaint is the buttons make me nervous, because they seem to be heavy and i worry that i'll lose one, but only on the front 2, the arms and back buttons seem to be just fine. overall this is a fantastic buy that is great for an office setting",pos
"I love this sports bra. i do various exercises and it works great for all of them from yoga to running. the floral pattern is what really drew me to get this, but the quality of this bra is the best i've ever gotten. i wear a 34b bra and the medium fits perfect!!",pos
I love western motif so i had to try this t shirt. quality is great..material is high quality. also the length is long..perfect with jeans and jacket or sweater!,pos
"I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently, but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me.",pos
"This is a very cute dress! the sweater material is not itchy at all. i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress. good quality and well made. i am 5' 9"" tall and this dress falls just above my knees. so for me, it's the perfect length. i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter.",pos
Love this jacket! it is incredibly soft and expensive looking. i love the details with the zippers on the sleeves and very cute lining inside the jacket which is not pictured. i ordered my usual size xxsp and it fit great. this brand does run small so if you are between sizes or prefer a looser fit you should order a size up.,pos
"I wear these pants 3-4 days a week. i work in advertising, so they go perfectly with the polished/ trendy/ casual office attire that is required! they are simply the most comfortable jeans i own-- and also make me look slimmer without looking too tight. they are a unique type of material, a soft but structured stretch weave-- so more polished than normal jeggings-- and smooth over bumps, while still highlighting subtle curves. the zippers at the bottom add an edgy polish, but also provide a more",pos
"I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater, which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well",pos
"What a great, easy to wear jumpsuit! i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fit...sometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out? anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish, comfortable and it looks amazing on.",pos
I totally thought this was a dress when i tried it on and bought it in the store. there is a drawstring on the inside to cinch the waist making it look so cute as a dress.,pos
"I noticed this dress in the highlighted area and then read the reviews. i probably wouldn't have thought much about it just scrolling through the dress pages, and now i'm so glad i bought it. i have worn this dress several times and never fail to get compliments on it. i know i will wear it again come next fall. i am petite, but ordered the regular and find that length to be perfect. i'm a teacher and this dress helps me maintain a classy yet modern look. i purchased the small (usually wear size",pos
This top is both cute and flattering. it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous. i highly recommend,pos

"This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations! 
i'm 5'2"", 140 lbs with an athletic build, and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming! with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is :) i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium. 

the material is thick, high quality, and the colors are exactly the way they appear online. 
the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude. i feel like i got 4 tops in one sinc",pos
"Beautiful piece! the model actually doesn't do this piece justice. it is stunning. a light, yet quality fabric that drapes effortlessly and ties comfortably. great with a white tee and sllm jeans. runs ever so slighty large, but i took my normal size (xs) and for the type of piece it is, it works.",pos
"I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light, but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape, and while the fit is on the loose side, it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color, and it's divine. definitely worth the price.",pos
"If you are in between sizes order smaller size. adorable dress. boots or booties look adorable with it. denim jacket or dress it up. can go either way!  colors are beautiful. i ordered the small and medium and kept the small. i did have it shortened. for reference, i am 5'4. 120 pounds.",pos
"This is a super cute style and i love it with white skinnies. i purchased the gray colorway. i am normally a small in tops but purchased the xs based on other reviews. the xs is still pretty loose on me, but i don't mind too much because i like flowy tops anyway. the color is so pretty and the design is edgy. it will transition to fall well.",pos
"These are so great! love the fabric weight ( light ) they look great on - the pictures don't do these justice! i tried them on in the store with a black sleeveless crop top (you couldn't see any mid skin) and it looked great together, might have to go back and get the top! they do look great with just a black tank as well though!",pos
"Maeve really keeps me guessing on sizing...usually too big, but this one is too small in my normal 4, so i went with the 6 for comfortable movement while still maintaining the intentional fitted look. fabric is of beautiful quality, colors are true to the picture - just a gorgeous timeless dress that i imagine wearing to many special events, or with a denim jacket over it for work :)",pos

"I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it's flattering for my curvy figure.",pos
Great fitting and super cute!!!!! my husband said this is the cutest bathing suit i've owned!!! and i live in bathing suits!!!,pos

"I bought this in a size 0 which is my usual retailer size. the lace is nice quality, not rough or scratchy. i purchased the ivory which does have some blush accents which make it look ""vintagey"". it will be perfect for the holidays or all fall/winter. i like that the peplum doesn't seem to flair out much. very pretty!",pos

Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!,pos
"Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available, i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28"" waist, 35"" hips, wide",pos

"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures, no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth.",neg

I'm not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt. i saw it in-store before it became available on-line and knew i had to have it. i don't like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt. i'm curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine. i would definitely recommend this product!,pos

I am very pleased with this purchase. a nude colored racer back bra works perfectly under it and does not show through.   i have worn this with jean shorts and linen pants and it looks great with both. it is slightly on the dressy side so i also plan to wear it to work  paired with a skirt or dress pants and a cardigan.   i am a 34a  and size small  fits nicely.,pos

overpriced, to boot.
obviously, mine is a minority opinion.",neg
I wanted to love this shirt. it's not my usual style buy it looked so great online. unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online. i'm fair coloring & it just wasn't flattering. i'm thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasn't right for me. could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me.,neg
"This one arrived at my store and was sold out in two days! everyone loves it. the fabric is a woven material. very light, a little sheer but comfortable and really airy! it has a bit of weight to it, so it doesn't stick at all which is a win for me. the colors are perfectly neutral. this is as long as it looks in the photos. tunic length and i love it! i am 5'8 and it hits below my toosh. loved wearing this with leggings and jacket, or pairing it with denim. i adore it and i'm so glad i grabbed",pos
This is totally different. great addition to my wardrobe!,pos

it runs a bit large. i normally wear size medium for tops from retailer, but the size s of this sweater fits better than size m. the sleeves are bit long than other sweaters, but i think that's the style, as shown on the model.

"Tried these on out of sheer curiosity -- i've got a long torso & was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are! they manage to look flowing & sleek without shortening the legs. took a size 6 with my 27"" waist, 37"" hips. it's a bit of a generous fit, especially around the waist, but they're extremely comfortable & have room to tuck tops into. i have the cowled sweater tank in gray & it looks fantastic over these! couldn't resist getting both the rust and black. perfect for a dressy casual look",pos
"So i really loved this dress. i am tall (6ft) and the size 8 was perfect length. i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals. i would say it is true to size. i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of ""flow"" without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack. the back is just gorgeous and unique. here is why i couldn't make it mine. the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin. there is literally not much to it and i'm not sure it wou",neg
"I wore this out to a dinner-party that was thrown for me, and people loved the surprise back. i have a few lace back shirts, but this one is gorgeous and sexy. i am incredibly cautious about the lace, however. it is so delicate. no issues, but just be careful!",pos
"Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,",neg
"I saw this dress at my local retailer and passed it the first time. one week later, i stopped by and skimmed through the store and went back to the dress...and decided to try it on. boy oh boy! i grabbed a small and a medium (i usually wear a medium) and the small fit perfectly! the fabric is thick and feels so soft and nice. i love the pockets! worth the splurge and like the other reviewer said- it's not maternity like at all. i plan to wear it with brown boots or brown heels.",pos
"The blouse is absolutely beautiful. i am 5' and the length is perfect. even though it fit a little snug across the chest, it's a keeper. i'll wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath.",pos
"This piece was so gorgeous that i bought it despite how impractical it is to wear it in honolulu. it's honestly the perfect little number to wear if you want to go for a late autumn/early winter stroll in the city. it's incredibly comfortable and versatile. i've worn it on cool mornings in honolulu as a dress with booties, and a few months ago, i wore it to minneapolis and added leggings and a warm pea coat. depending on how you choose to accessorize the look, it can be casual or professional. i",pos
"This top is ""comfort wear"" or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work. because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer. that said, it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it. i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time, it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable",pos
"This is an adorable top. i had to have it in both colors. it has a unique shape to it, and the simple details give it so much appeal. the beautiful fall like colors can be layered easily into the cooler weather of the season.",pos
I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!!,pos
"Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely. i am 5'10"" like it states the model is, and it falls shorter on me that viewed, but still looks nice. it will be an easy dress to use for different looks.",pos
Love this t-shirt....i will be wearing this until it wears out. very soft; great fit; and very comfortable....,pos
Absolutely love this top. followed reviewer advice to size down and got the medium. good choice and probably could have gotten a small. love the fabric and pattern. it's so light and pretty. love the marriage of bare shoulders with sleeves.,pos
"I had to write a review on this one because i am obsessed with it, it is the softest and yummiest sweater ever and i plan on wearing it constantly!",pos
Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!,neg
"Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size.
thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you.",pos
"I read all the reviews and they were very helpful the waist does run small so i sized up which was perfect. i love how this skirt is lightweight and swingy. i cant get enough comfortable denim skirts. so size up and you will love this, i am a slightly hippy girl and the skirt did not make me look big at all.",pos
"This tunic has really cute detail. it is hard to see in online photos, but there is dark brownish beading over the embroidery. the fabric is not as soft as i would have liked, but it's still a keeper because of the two patterns, embroidery and beading. also, it is long and does run large, but i think the measurements given in the description are accurate. it is a tunic after all! i ordered an xs petite, and it will be very cute with leggings and boots.",pos
The color was very different and vibrant. chose to size up for extra room and length,pos
Seafolly is my favorite brand in swimwear. i've collected a few over the years. i was so happy to find this print. the little umbrellas are so cute and fun. i am normally a size 8 in seafolly and this one ran true to size.,pos
"I loved this sweater! it is a little thin, so i will probably wear a tank under it, but you could probably get away without one, i am normally either an xs or a small, and i got the xs in this sweater. the bottom is a little loose like in the models photo, but i really like it.",pos
Beautiful and comfy!!!! love it!,pos
"I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on, but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress, which i think is nice, no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about, but it ties the dress together nicely.
the front pocket is different, but i really like it. i had a hard time conceptualizing it before",pos
I was so excited for this dress to come. i am 5&#39;1&quot; and 100lbs so i ordered and xs petite. it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around. maybe on someone taller this would have looked great. i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate. my dress was a much lighter blue. back to the store it goes.,neg
Super cute style but runs slightly larger then other ag jeans i have.,pos
"This was absolutely adorable on. it does look a bit like a dress but at 5'3 and 118 lbs i am normally a size 4, and needed the 2 in this. it fit so perfectly i didn't consider the petite. i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra. i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down. only draw back is dry clean only. super cute, and i definitely recommend this. cuter in person and on.",pos
"I saw this dress online this morning, went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest, but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts, and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest, and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!",pos
"I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.",neg
"Love the shirt. exteemely comfortable, simple and nice.",pos
Lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store! the sleeves are not big,pos
Lovely dress!  i&amp;amp;#39;m wearing it with a blue denim jacket and brown suede boots.  it is most certainly purple - a little more so than the picture.  still love it.,pos
Very cute dress for 5'5 or taller,pos
"I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it! it does not smell, nor does it itch, as the other reviewer stated... at least not for me. i was worried about the green color, but it's quite lovely. this is a keeper for me! i am 5'1"", but ordered the regular xs, and i am happy with the length.",pos
A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.,pos
This dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model. the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color. i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did! perfect dress for work and going out. the petite hits me mid-thigh like in the photo.,pos
"This skirt is gorgeous, sturdy, well constructed. i was afraid the midi length would look frumpy, but it was beautiful. it has a nice lining, flares into a pretty a line, and has a pull tab belt around the waist to cinch it a bit. i am normally a 2-4, and i bought the 4. it was a bit big, but the belt helped with that. i wore it for my bridal shower and got many compliments!",pos
"From unique shape to feminine design, this cropped summer sweater is the kind of item that attracted me to retailer thirteen years ago.  it's also flattering, especially for this petite, who doesn't like to show her upper arms.",pos
"The back of this t-shirt looks cute but the front looks really weird. the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft, so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy. i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front. it fits true to size.",neg
"Beautiful dress! perfect mid length dress for the colder months. i tried a size 2 regular first (my normal dress size) but it was a little baggy, so the 0 fit perfectly.",pos
"This pink tank is a wonderful addition to my go-to basics. i love the color, which is a nice deep pink that is pretty spot on in terms of accuracy to the online photo. it is a wonderful comfy fabric and the side knot adds nice visual interest to make this top appealing and unique. i also appreciate the wide straps, which means i can wear a normal bra instead of a strapless one without worrying about straps playing peek-a-boo. the only drawback is size. i ordered my usual xs (i am 5'5"", 110 lbs,",pos
Fits perfectly! i don't think this is too long and i'm a shorty. great style -- wish it came in more colors - i would definitely buy again!,pos
"Dress is pretty and works are a tunic, too. i'm short 5'1.5"" but the fabric does not overwhelm me.",pos
Soft and cozy every day tee that can be dressed up or worn casually. only compliant is i wish it came in more colors!,pos
Bought this dress in store after trying it on. loved it. it's sexy with the lower cut front. the fabric is flowy and breathable. runs true to size. usually wear a 10 with my hips but the 8 fit better on top.the sides are well designed so your bra doesn't show. i'm 5''6' 32g size 29/30 jeans and athletic/hourglass built. i can't wait to wear it out. the pictures don't do it justice.,pos
This dress is unique and lovely! it is a one of a kind dress. i found it to be true to size. the only downside is the quality of the buttons.,pos
"I love this sweater, it's so soft, and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it. it runs true to size, but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more, it seems to stretch a little. overall, i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!",pos
"I am in love with these jeans!! i can't say enough about them. they are so forgiving yet keep their shape great. they are soft, comfortable and are a great color. these jeans have the perfect amount of stretch while being substantial and durable.",pos
I love this top. the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering. it's so pretty. the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things. the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasn't too short. i highly recommend this top.,pos
These white jeans are super cute. the longer length is perfect for tall ladies who can still roll them up. you can also adjust the height of the cuff since it is not pre-attached to the jeans. i will wear them all the time.,pos
"I pretty much am in agreement with the first, original reviewer on here. big disappointment, especially if you have hips and are busty.

pros:
- great breathable fabric.
- cute look overall.
- sash in front brings it all together.
- buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric, which is a nice touch.

cons:

Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!,pos
Love this top! i bought it in 2 colors; it's a great twist on a basic tee. love love love!,pos
"This top is perfect for a weekend casual look. you will love this, it fits true to size.",pos
"I had such high hopes for this blouse, as it looks totally stunning online. however, it's not as pictured/described in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat, but rather hd in paris. for the price, the quality is just not there...i've seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less. i returned it without a second thought.",neg
"Like another reviewer, i recently had a baby and ordered this to hide my belly. the m fits perfectly without looking too large, and the sleeves fit me just fine. i love the thicker fabric, and his is he perfect length for leggings.",pos
I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's,pos
"This is a gorgeous print, but i found it too fussy for my taste.  it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck. it looked cute for about 2 seconds, but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down.",neg
"Alas, i so wanted to love this. the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous -- flowy, drapey, ultimate grecian goddess. but it just doesn't work unless you're super-skinny. too much material. almost bulky; strange looking. the print is so beautiful -- i love the pink floral, and i love the whole idea of the dress. but it just doesn't work. have to send it back. 

(i'm 5'6"", 135 pounds, 38-30-38, and i ordered a 10.)",neg
Bought this cami/tank on sale which i'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted..it kinda just drapes under the cami...the problem is it's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ...but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest ..so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment...it simply looks awkward ...not sure if it would've been better,neg
"I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag, it seemed huge. (i wear both l and xl, depending on the sizing) when i tried it, it did look like the photo - it's meant to be a little voluminous. the arms were a little snug, so sizing down was out of the question. it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans. i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design, which is just a teeny bit off. the lace is delicate too, btw, so care will be needed not to snag it.",pos
"I have been thinking about getting this dress for a while, but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack! but i am so glad i got it, and so glad my usual size was not available! typically i'm a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite. while still flowy, i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size. i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down. i can't wait to wear it! definitely consider sizing down.",pos
"One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned, the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before, so i don't know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger, but i definitely have neede",pos
"It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height. the pull-on styling is a #fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening! i was afraid it might rip a seam. the fabric seems low quality, like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others. overall, not the dress or quality i expected :/",neg
This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!,pos
"When i tried on this dress my husband's jaw dropped to the ground. it is so unique and so beautiful on. however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed. i am a size 6, 5'8"" and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section. my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen. buy this!",pos
"I wanted so badly to love this dress, but i couldn't get past the thin material that you can actually see through. not for this price anyhow. the dress is shorter than i had anticipated, and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isn't accurately portrayed in the photo. on the positive though, the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning, but alas will be returning.",neg
I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.,pos
"-like others, i agree that this is a staple that will pair with many, many outfits. it is really well-constructed, classic, comfortable, and a wonderful length for us taller gals. as you can see from my stats, i'm rather tall at 5'9"", so it's hard to find",pos
"These are very fun and breezy pants. i first ordered a medium, but the waist was too low. i exchanged for a large and i love the fit now. i like them loose and airy. for reference i am usually a 10-12 petite and the l regular is super cute ;0) i hope they wash well. they are perfect for the hot and humid northern va summer.",pos
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.,pos
"What more could you want than a dress that slips on easily, hugs all the right places and skims the others, feels like pajamas, and looks great for any occasion? i am about 120, 5'-1', 32 dd, usually a 4 petite. i ordered the petite small in navy and it fits just like the model photos. i tried it on in the store in a regular small and x-small, and could have gone with either, but the petite had better proportions, especially where the v-neck hit (i would have had to wear a very low plunge bra wi",pos
"This skirt is really adorable, but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top, so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though, super cute!

the waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of. i usually take a 0/2 pant or 25/26 jean. i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling. i'll be exchanging for a small, hopefully t",pos
"I love this dress, i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip, it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress, it would look good on any body type.",pos
"This is one of my all time favorite retailer purchases. this dress is perfect in every way - mine fits me exactly like the model and i was lucky enough to purchase it in black. if you're on the fence, take the plunge and buy this dress - you won't be disappointed!",pos
This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.,pos
I ordered this as a gift and may order myself one. it is so comfortable and pretty.,pos
Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.,neg
"I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it. after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it. 

i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs, not in my torso. i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly. the fabric is very ""flowey"" and does not wrinkle. the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy. the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su",pos
"These pants are very cute for spring/summer, and i enjoy having the option of a looser silhouette with a bit of length (nearly all of my pants are a cropped skinny these days!). i agree with the other reviews that have described the leg as being less straight-legged than they are pictured. on me, they have a subtle flare -- nothing major, but just enough to break perfectly over my shoe. they fit tts on me, but i did need to have the hem taken up. i'm 100 lbs, 5'0 and the 0p fits perfectly. i hav",pos
Such a great purchase! it can be dressed up or down and seems to go with everything! great for summer!,pos
Love this dress!!! thought the colors would be too much but it actually isn't and is just so cute. got a ton of compliments on it when i wore it! the material is light but not see through at all. the length is perfect and comfortable to sit around in. this will be my go to dress this fall!,pos
"I'm 119 and small frame, but took a chance and ordered the m. so glad...the fit was perfect. the robe is soft and beautiful!",pos
"I loved these pants - super soft and cozy and perfect for winter. i've worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have 2 holes! they don't say handwash and my washer/dryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes. maybe i just ended up with a bad pair, but i found the quality to be disappointing :(",neg
"This dress is indeed so lovely in person. i am so glad i ordered 2 sizes (0p and 2p) based on the straighter-looking cut. i am 115 lbs, 5'1.5"", adn 30dd bra size. verdict, the 2p fit better. why, the cehst area is a little snug and hte buttons kept trying to open (and did# i would have ahd to leave it pen and wear a tank under this dress... not an option with such a unique piece.

"I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort, quality, and design. it is a little short, but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer's clothes, but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o",pos
Love it to layer. it is not heavy the perfect weight & soft material. my daughters all want to steal it!,pos
These are awesome! i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color. they are beautiful and very nice quality. they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering.,pos
"Very cute shorts. sadly, after one wash they became a lint magnet so had to be returned. disappointing quality.",pos
"I love how unique this top is, especially the buttons that run on the back.
it is cut boxy, but i think it works because there is so much other detail going on. the fabric is comfortable, and the stitching on the inside is not irritating.",pos
"Beautiful and comfortable, although it is a lot looser at the bottom than pictured, and the slit on the sides is quite high. not deal breakers though!",pos
"Tried this on just for fun today and ended up taking it home in the glorious blue. many have commented on the sizing issue. for reference i am 5'5, 120 lbs, 32a, slender athletic build. i bought a size 2 and it fits like a dream. no large arm holes, no gaping buttons  and the length is perfect. yes it will wrinkle, it's linen. that's part of the look. i feel this will fill a void in my closet that was missing. i was wearing flat ankle wrap espadrilles when i tried it on and it looked super cute.",pos
"Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.",neg
"It's a sweatshirt that isn't typically sweatshirt looking. first, it's spacedye. then there's the hi-lo hem. it's mock neck and it's wide neck. sleeves are low and cocoon-y. it's oversize in looks but not overwhelming. i love that i can throw this on over jeans or leggings, step into a pair of flats or trainers, whip my hair up into a bun and head out without looking too sloppy.",pos

"The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.
i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit, so if you prefer something more form fitting, you might opt for a smaller size.",pos

"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the",pos

This is such a pretty dress. it will look beautiful in the summer with a tan and lace up sandals for a very effortless look. fits very fitted in the top and loose throughout yet still slimming. i am petite 5'2 about 105 pounds and for reference i went with the xxsp. it looks expensive and well made and the yellow color is stunning and cheery. the yellow will look beautiful on darker skin tones as well as lighter skin tones who have a warm undertone. if you are on the fence order it and you won't,pos
"These are so much better than i anticipated! they are lightweight for summer, the perfect length (i'm 5'7"" and they are just right with a 2"" wedge), and very flattering. i will be living in these all summer long! i agree with the other reviewer who felt the catalog picture misrepresented them. they do not have a technicolor sheen at all. rather, they are a beautiful, classic chambray.",pos
Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right. the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy. does not give any shape to the body. do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest.,neg
"Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not",pos

I had to have this when i saw it in a store. i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors. i wore it for the first time today with a black tank. on me it looks best unbuttoned. it looks good with pants. the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms. i have muscles so i don't think i could wear it with any top with sleeves.,pos

"I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab",pos
I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on. i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size 0 and a size 2. it was huge! it looked like i was wearing a potato sack!!! i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful! i am so disappointed.,neg
"The tank is very structured, thick yet breathable, not see through. the coral is much brighter in person, and the white is more like a light cream color. the white is versatile for all seasons but i like the coral because it's such an unusual color. size regular xs is fitted on me (not too tight, not too loose, but over the course of the day, it stretches a little) and the hem falls at the upper hip (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my favorite part is the arm holes are not too big. the knit a",pos
"Love this top! got it in white for a recent trip to paris - felt chic and cool during a bit of a spring heat wave in the city of lights. it runs somewhat small - i'm 5'7, 128 lbs, broad shoulders, and got the 6. my usual 4 fit but was a little snug. i would recommend going up in size in this style. the 6 looked better because it is supposed to be a boxy, swingy top.",pos
"I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews, and when they went on sale. i'm leaving this review for women who share my body type.

i'm slim with longer legs, and don't really have curves. i typically don't purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than 30''. for reference, i really love the fit of paige and m.i.h. jeans.

these jeans have an inseam of 31'', which i thought would be fine. but for me, the cut wasn't flattering at all. i typically look for jeans that",neg
"After trying several sizes, including petite and regular, i am sad to return this dress. the regular sizes were too long on me (i am 5'4"") and although the petite fit me just a little short, the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me. i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldn't get the fit. usually i have great luck with cloth & stone.",neg
"This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!",pos
"This is a light, so fun to wear shirt. it's delicate and can be worn to dress up jeans. i would very much recommend it. love it!",pos
This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!,pos
"I bought these about a month ago and i love them! great fit, not too tight for legging jeans, which means i can dress up with a tunic and boots for work. so stretchy and comfortable, but still made out of a jean-type material. love the color - it's a bit of a gray black, so looks great with everything!",pos
The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering. the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique.,pos
"I love this tunic. purchased the dark orange in medium (i am 5'9 and 140 lbs). tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad, so went with the medium and glad i did - this top should be comfortable. feels very fall and perfect for casual get-togethers and running around town. only comment is that it is rayon... and for me anyway rayon doesn't wash too well - so we shall see how this one fairs.",pos
This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.,neg
"This dress is very well-made, fully-lined, and overall quite beautiful. however, i will have to agree with the other reviewers who say that it runs small. i am typically a solid medium in retailer clothes (5'9"", 36b, 155 lbs., apple shaped, long torso), but the medium in this is skin. tight. not a good look. the large fit much better and i did not find the skirt to be like a pencil (the fit is like the picture) and the length is at the knee. anyway, interesting that there is a such a huge differen",pos
"Pretty and comfortable fun cardi for those of us who love a nice little cropped number. glad to report that this cobalt beauty fits true to size in an xs all over -- shoulders hit at a nice place, arms, waist, length is great above your waist or just at it. the cotton is ultra comfortable. the zipper has that luxurious feature of a double zip where you can zip from the bottom or the top once closed, creating a nice opening. i love this for a casual but chic holiday look thanks to the velvet ador",pos
"This dress is absolutely stunning! the colors are vibrant and it flows very nicely touching the floor. 
 it runs very small, i ordered size medium and i could not even zip the dress, i normally wear size 10. i had to return it and order again in size large. i love the fit this time!! but be aware if your normal size is higher than 10 this dress will not fit and larger sizes are not available for this dress. it is nice addition to my wardrobe and i am planning to wear it to the multiple occasion",pos
"Bought this to wear to desert trip this weekend when we see the stones, dylan, mccartney, who, roger walters and neil young. think its the perfect outfit as it definitely has an 80's feel, now if only i had a pair of brown or teal boots, it would be perfect. i'll keep hunting~",pos
This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.,neg
This is a great fall boho dress. you can dress up or down depending on the shoes. looks great with boots! but definitely size down!!,pos
Love this top!! so comfy and flattering. i ordered the black and the blue and i am itching to get the red/purple one too!,pos
"I almost bought this tank online, but decided to wait. once i saw it in the store, i knew i had to have it. i bought it in the ivory color, which is perfect. the gold details are subtle, and so pretty. i don't find it too sheer, as some of the other reviews have stated. the cut is so flattering, and it is easy to wear to work when paired with a cardigan.",pos
"Soft, slouchy, and comfortable.
what more could you ask for?",pos
This runs large. i usually wear a m so i ordered the m/l. reordering in next size down and hope that helps. i gave it 5 stars because the knit is beautiful and quality looked great.,pos

the quality and color are great!",pos
"This a a great sweater! it is classic, but has the fun surprise element of the lace bell sleeves. loved it so much i got the black and the sea mist. looks great with jeans or leggings! the only negative is you can call it that is that the sleeves are a tad long for me. compliments everytime i wear!",pos
"I was a little hesitant to buy these given that i am just 5'1"" - i didn't want to look like an extra from the set of ""newsies."" but these are very well made and tailored for a woman's body...the trousers actually accentuate the waist and the cropped leg works well for a petite frame. they are nicely lined and the wool blend is soft and not scratchy. i love them!",pos
"I really love these pants as ""loungers"". not sure i would wear them outside the house, because the legs are very wide.. yes, the elastic has the problem that others have mentioned, but i just hold it in place when i pull them on and it stays put. but the fabric is so soft that i put them on every night after work and sometimes don't take them off before bed. pockets are a nice touch - something i have come to love about retailer pants.",pos
Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!,pos
"But tight around the chest, i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area, kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic, and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference.",pos
"I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet. the style is very cute, but the fabric is quite thin. she will have to make that call, but if i had bought it for myself, it would be going back. i'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt. it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it's washed, so that remains to be seen.",neg
Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.,neg
"This is simply a fabulous dress. i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small (though there is nothing wrong with that). i am not. i am older and heavier, and the dress fits very well. i'm also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tent-like. the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable. you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening. it looks great with a jean jacket, for example, and booties. and it also looks terrific with flats. it d",pos
I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect,pos
"I hesitated to spend the money on this sweater but somehow knew it would be my go-to sweater for the season. when i tried it on, i knew i made the right decision - it feels luxurious and fits like a dream. the pop of color on the pocket is perfect to make a statement and to add something different from all those other sweaters! the fit is tts.",pos
This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.,pos
"Love this top, it's a 100% cotton and looks amazing with jeans. you should consider ordering a size up, i am usually an 0, 32d and 107pound. tried the 0 in store it just didn't feel right the size 2 fit just right.
love the shirt, and got tons of complement:)",pos
"Most flattering and perfect dark skinny jean! obsessed is an understatement. i am becoming a big fan of mother denim! just enough stretch to be comfortable all day, sit a little bit higher on my waist, which is wonderful (post babies) and sometimes hard to find in jeans. if you are in between sizes, be sure to size down! these jeans are stretchy to begin with and will stretch out a whole size. i have never been happier with a pair of jeans!",pos
"Very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall, 120 lbs. i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top.. sadly returned the top. otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric.",neg
"Love cloth and stone. this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured. soft and casual, with great design details.",pos
These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.,pos
"This is the perfect warm cozy boho sweater. the blue trim really stands out and brightens up the grey. this sweater will look cute over any outfit, or with jeans. i have long arms, and the sleeves almost cover my hands, which i really like. i highly recommend this, especially at 20% off!",pos

This is a great looking sweater. very nice quality and is a great design. can wear with many colors. love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look. nice!!!!.,pos
"I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose. i love it! the bottom hem is slightly flared, but does not look like a maternity tee. i'm going to wear this with a fun scarf, skinnies and colorful flats! this tee is a must!",pos
Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.,pos
"It's hard to find a comfortable, attractive tee. this one is it for me. ordered a large. it skims perfectly over my back and lower half. no grabbing. sleeves are cut nicely for those of us who don't love their upper arms. the lacing adds nice detail and interest. it's soft and comfy. it's an unusual color that will go with almost any bottom. great now and under a jean jacket or cardigan as the weather cools.",pos
"This sweater is comfy and light and the buttons are a great added detail. i bought this as a gift, but i tried it on anyways and almost kept it for myself! great for early spring days.",pos
"When i walked into my local retailer, two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways, and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom. unfortunately the small was sold out, but they were able to order it online and have it sent. gorgeous medium-to-lightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in.",pos
I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.,neg

"Coat is very soft and comfortable. runs large; usually wear an xsp, could have gone with an xxsp, if it came in that size. the lining is very soft. can wear a sweater or something heavier underneath, if needed.
some small, little pulls on outside fabric, but, might be part of the fabric. outside fabric is very soft. would not have paid full price; glad it was on sale, as i had been eyeing it for some time. it is cute, and felt like twirling, when put it on!",pos
"I wasn't sure about this dress, and decided to give it a shot based on reviews, could not be happier. before trying it on i was worried about the length, and always worry about dreaded button gap at the chest, but none of that is an issue.",pos
"I bought this sweater in the black. it is so flattering and feels great on. the sleeves are a bit long, but they are supposed to be. the material is not overly thick, yet it feels soft and well made. while the lace sleeves are the star of this show, the back is so flattering! it has a perfect cut that i don't think comes through in the picture. it fits true to size. love this one!!!!",pos
"I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.",pos
"This is such a cute dress! the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight. i ordered the black/beige print and the fabric is beautiful. it really drapes and hangs nicely. because there is so much fabric, i don't think this dress needs a lining. it seems to wash and hang dry well. i'm 5'4"", about 160 lbs. i like the way the medium fit. the length was slightly above the knee, which was ok with me (i'm nearly 60.) all in all, i can see mys",pos
"Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy, and a straight style. i did size down, because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.",pos

"I was at first a bit leery of this dress because of the shape. baggy is in, but it's not always flattering. i am usually a big small-medium and the medium was too fluffy. i realize it's supposed to be loose, but not that loose. i'm 5'8"" and 146 lbs and the small was the best option. perfect amount of looseness but still gave a hint of shape. it has pockets and is so comfortable. i'm a school teacher so i try to find clothes that i can wear in both worlds. this is definitely a keeper! i will for",pos
I got this shirt 2 weeks ago and have already worn it 4 times! i love it and every time i wear it i get compliments on it. it is so flattering with jeans or nice fitted black pants. if you are wavering about getting this shirt.... get it. i promise you will love it.,pos
"I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size, medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight, casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.",pos

"This one is a beauty! my store is not carrying the white - they had a lovely blue (periwinkle-ish) that immediately caught my eye. the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop - more so than the blue variety but both are stunning. the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate. quality most definitely in line with the price.

"To be honest, i bought this as a pregnancy top since i can't bring myself to buy actual maternity wear. it is gorgeously made of lovely light material, and i can actually see myself wearing it even after baby. i find the asymmetrical hemline to be really chic - overall a fave.",pos
"This is the perfect grab and go t-shirt. i love the fun design as it takes a simple t-shirt and makes it fun. i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist. the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look, size down. very cute.",pos
"I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion, so if you have bigger arms, it might feel too snug. you don't really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side, meaning one folds back higher than the other, so it isn't a symmetrical look. i actually lik",pos
"This sweater has every special element i could want .... form fitting, feminine, and attention to detail. i ordered it in turquoise, which is a lovely muted turquoise that works well when dressed up or down with a cream cami. because i am petite, the fitted waist detail in back hits me just in the right spot. thank you, retailer, for another timeless addition to my collection of yours.",pos
"This is a beautiful lightweight sheer blouse. the front has a liner and the arms and back are sheer. i usually wear a s or xs - the xs was plenty roomy. i'll wear a cami due to the sheerness of the back .the cutouts in the long sleeves are quite pretty. overall this is a classy blouse that can be worn with any number of jeans, slacks or skirts. thanks retailer!",pos
I love this skirt and was so happy to see it in stores again in a great color for the fall. the fit is great for me because i do not have a flat stomach and the elastic makes it comfortable to wear. the material is a good quality. this skirt adds the perfect pop of color to my closet.,pos
"This jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful. i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer. sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it, too tight on chest and arms. i recommend going a size up. also this jacket is really cropped, probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it, otherwise might appear too short.",pos

"I'm 5'2.5"" and petite and had originally ordered s but decide that it was a bit large for me so i returned it and ordered the xs and it fit like a glove with breathing space. i love the conservative style. i can easily move around in it when i'm in the water with my baby. i don't have a large chest but i imagine this would great for big busted girls. it's lightly padded around the bust area. the skirt detail is very cute and the print is unique. i've already gotten compliments on it.",pos
"I've been trying on ""boyfriend"" jeans for more than a year, finally found a pair that fit and were comfortable. many of them had no stretch at all and were very uncomfortable. these have just enough stretch, but not too much. i usually wear a 29-30, tried on the 29 which were comfortable but too loose at the waist. the 28 were a perfect fit.
i'm 5'8"", 140lbs.",pos
"This is a great shirt to wear with jeans or pants. i love the tucks in front with brass buttons. you don't have to unbutton all of them as the shirt slides easily over your head, i love the pattern and it is a great look for fall and later on winter . i think this will be my go-to shirt this season.",pos
"Love, love, love this sweater. it is so comfy and well made. this is a piece i will have for a very long time. the beautiful lace detail are the sleeves are to die for. picture doesn't do this sweater justice.",pos
"I fell in love with this top as soon as i tried it on; it's the perfect spring-to-summer top. the fabric is light and airy, and the brown stripes give it a lackadaisical vibe. the little buttons on the back are a cute detail that really give something extra to an otherwise simple top, and the v-neck did not reveal any cleavage. i bought this in a large, and i'd say it runs a little on the larger side, but i like that because it adds to the comfortable, flowy nature of the design. for reference,",pos
Ordered this in white and the peachy color- the armholes were gaping. not well designed. i don't recommend this tee at all.,neg
"I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it.  i got home and showed my husband my purchases.  i told him i wasn't sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me.  he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it.  so great for a spring wedding. fits true to size.  i am 125 5'4"" c-cup and i bought my normal size 0.  this made my waist look really small.",pos
"I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice",neg
"I love this dress! it is beyond flattering! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste. this however.. is the same cut on top, but longer in the skirt! yes, please! i purchased the turquoise, which is exactly as pictured! just beautiful! hits at my shins. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 136 lbs and ordered a size small.",pos
The softest tank i own. even though it's a soft burnout fabric it's still not too sheer. great quality,pos
"This sweater is more stunning in person then on the site. i saw it on the internet previous to seeing in the store. i purchased it right away, it was love at first sight!!. the detail on the collar is beautiful, and reminds me of the unique sweaters i have have in my closet from retailer from years ago that i still love. get it before it's gone!!!!",pos
"I absolutely love this sweater. it's super soft and the grey/white version is lovely. it's definitely more cropped (i'm 5'7), but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt. 

so cozy!",pos
Cute and comfortable. has layered design with black underneath which adds dimension and warmth. can wear in multiple seasons with and without jacket.,pos
"These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts, tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.",pos
"I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders, armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh",pos
"I wanted to like this sporty dress too. i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level - plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go - go - go being ""on"" every second...the armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared. i didn't like the middle ""ridge"" either as it was unflattering. it was returned.",neg
I'm always on the search for a comfortable shirt with style. this does not disappoint. super comfy and flattering. love.,pos
"I love these jeans. i am normally a 25 so i went with a 25 petite. i'm 5'4"" and the length was perfect. the 25 was a little big so i'm going to order the 24 petite and compare. they r a great material and very stretchy",pos
I bought this dress to wear to a funeral. i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly! the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets! the fabric lies beautifully on the body. i would recommend this dress.,pos
"I got size 26 and they don't fit me as ankle, they fit me as long skinnies, but the quality is so good. they're smooth and stretchy, but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell it's quality denim. a great pant buy if you're looking for soft as butter grey jeans.",pos
"I bought the dress in black. it is very elegant with a fun flare, suits my taste. it does run a size too small like other reviewer mentioned. the material has no give at all. i couldn't breathe in my regular size. one size up fits like a glove. it is a perfect party dress to show your free and fun spirit!",pos
This is my favorite purchase so far! i am in love with this jumpsuit. it it fitted on top and has a flowy dress feel on the bottom. i got this on sale recently and if you can grab it do it! you won't be disappointed.,pos
Must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes. beautiful. i'm machine washing w delicates n hang dry. comes out great. easy breezy.,pos
I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.,pos
"I really like this top. it is made of cotton and linen blend, so the fabric is not as soft as i would have expected. however, it did not bother me at all, and i am really liking it.
the fabric is on a sheer side, so it is a bit see through. nothing too revealing, however it is a thin fabric.
overall, i am happy with this top!",pos
"I usually wear a 27 in ag and other designer jeans. i ordered a 29 based on the other reviewers. they fit like the model and look great. i might have been able to go with 28 if these end up stretching out, so i'm hoping they don't. they are nice and thick for white jeans, yet soft and comfy.",pos
"This top definitely drew my attention when i walked into the store. i loved the back and the fabric is super soft/silky. i tried it one and the usual 0 - fit nicely, i don't have petite to compare, or 00, but i decided to stick with 0. it will look so nice with white shorts (or navy# or jeans or even my denim pencil skirt... why i decided to buy it #i really must avoid the store!)

115 lbs for reference...",pos
I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.,pos
I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent. this top is so soft and a bit billowy.. the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall. i love the little details: staggered/ paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isn't as apparent in the photos. considering another color as well...,pos
"I adore this dress, the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down. the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin. i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it, but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look. the bottom hem is this super cute fringe, so fun and feminine. and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric. this dress",pos
"Love! adds texture and femininity to a basic sweater. ordered a small so i could layer. if you're busty or between a s and m, you may want to size up.",pos
This skirt is perfection. i am 5'8 130ibs and the 2 fit perfect. the picture does not even do it justice. it is much more softer than i thought it would be. in the picture it seems stiff looking but that is not the case at all. can't wait to wear this skirt for the summer. you can dress it up with a nice blouse and heels or keep it casual with a relaxed tee and sandals. i will defiantly get a lot of use out of this piece!,pos
"Another reviewer mentioned this was maternity-ish. i am currently almost 5 months pregnant, and i have to say: this is a wonderful maternity dress, even if that's not what it was made for. when not pregnant, i think this might have been a little overwhelming (and i guess we'll see next year if that's the case for me) -- there is a lot of fabric here. i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses, and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows. the colors on the blu",pos
"I loved the design and material of the test, but unfortunately it just did not fit me right. it was tight in the hips and did not have the relaxed look i was hoping for. 
also the pattern did not look good on me. 
unfortunately i had to return.",neg
"Totally my style, i love how it hangs and is so soft and comfy. material is thin enough to be fairly lightweight, and i was worried about it being clingy -- so happy it's not! body skimming and very flattering for full bust (v-neck helps here) if like me you don't like tight chested clothing. also love the length of this top. i'm 5'4"" and 36ddd, size l fits me just how i like it.",pos
I purchased this dress for a special occasion and am delighted it's exactly what i was hoping for. everything from the way it fits to the way it feels is perfect. i highly recommend it!,pos
So much prettier in person! beautiful colors matched together! so light and relaxing! love at first sight!,pos
"I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past, and i've never been disappointed with quality, style, or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering. i got these in a 4, my usual size, and the fit is perfect. i also got these in the regular, rather than petite, but the length works just fine for my height. i bought these in the grey stripe, but like them so much i think i'll order another pair in the orange.",pos
"I love the dress, fits as pictured , i'm a size 4 and fits just right. it is a keeper, well made.",pos
"Great pop of color (i purchased the rosy color) and great piece you can add layers to. it drapes beautifully, may run a tad larger, but not enough to size down. light weight, so wear alone for warmer fall days or as we get into spring, and with a scarf and jacket for cooler days.",pos
I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.,pos
"Love the lilac purple color, breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin. i like the small detail cut out in the back, and a high bonus point for not showing your bra. one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back, but not a big deal.",pos
"Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable, versatile, and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.",pos
"While the blue color pictured is stunning, i purchased the white poplin in store. two best features? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small ""v"" ( a great detail, especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months). next, this white fabric's crisp finish is coupled with a ""just right"" weight (solid enough to be opaque, but light enough for warm days). plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer. thrilled!",pos
"I tried this topper sweater on at the store but wanted to wait for it to go on sale so i just purchased it with my extra thirty percent off and think it's such a nice deal. i really like how this one is soft, well made, has nice long sleeves and how adorable the inside lining is. the lining matches the print inside the pockets that peak out a bit. i didn't find this one too boxy for me as it's a topper after all. there are no closure buttons or clasps but i think it's a great piece to throw on w",pos
"This dress looks great on...feminine and swishy! color is bright and the underslip is nicely attached, which i appreciate...no fighting with straps, etc. i ordered a six for my 5'4"", 130 lb, 34dd self and it fits like a dream. the extra 5 lbs i support with lots of food is on my tummy, just to give you an idea of my shape.",pos
"Love this shirt so much i bought it in 2 different colors. the reviews said it was so boxy and plain, but i disagree. looks great with jeans or a skirt without looking looking too casual. love that they are not too long also. so many tees are soon long and these are not thank goodness.
definitely runs big",pos
"I got this dress in pxxs in the gray color, i am 5'4"", 100lbs, petite frame, and it fits like a dream. true to size. the fabric is super soft and thick, drapes well, not too tight, and u can wear a regular bra!!!. length is also perfect, no shortening required (which is rare for me - this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that). it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion, can be casual or dressy depending on accessories. great purchase, 100% recommend.",pos
"I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to. 
other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.",pos
"Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!",neg
"This is a very cute top. i am 5'4'', 170lbs, 34dd, and a large fit great. it fit perfectly in the chest, but the top is meant to be baggy at the bottom and long (it covers my bum). looks very cute with skinny jeans. love it!",pos
"I can't believe how much i paid for this top~got free shipping special; so worth it. i ordered the blue and i love it! size small fits perfectly. i am into peplum tops lately, they are so flattering with highwaisted jeans. i usually wear a size 4-6 in retailer.",pos
"I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......
it runs really big
it's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.
colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.
fabric feels cheap and stiff
lining is stuff and poorly sewn.
i haven't one positive thing to say about t",neg
"I agree with the other reviewer: the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea, but bad in execution. they look and feel odd when on.

these fit tts, and they are soft with decent stretch. but the rise is much lower on me than other 8.5"" rise jeans i have; as a 43 year-old woman they seemed inappropriately low-hanging on me.

as an aside, these will def. color transfer - there is a whole lotta rinse on these. and they have a strange chemical smell to them; not sure if that will diss",neg
"I love this blouse!! the shape is very flattering. the fabric is sheer, perfect for those hot summer days. i especially like the way the sleeves fall, just enough flounce. the buttons are a great detail. i didn't bother undoing them, just threw it over my head. looks great dressed up or down.",pos
"I am 5'7 and 125lbs w a muscular bubble butt from climbing and biking. usually have trouble w shorts fitting right because my legs and waist don't match my butt. these shorts run large , i got a medium which should have been okay but they stretched out quite a bit after one wear so am returning for a small. it's crazy for my butt to be in a ""small""anything. so- if you are a skinny minny, or have a flat butt, these may not work for you in that you don't have anything to hold these up besides the",pos
"As the other reviewer said, the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price",neg
Very versatile top! i feel like i could dress it up or down. fits very nice and the material is soft.,pos

"I ordered my usual sz s during the promo. arrived yesterday & the fit is perfect w/ a little room to spare for layering. it's a snap front closure, front patch pockets, & attached hood that is small to med size-not huge or overwhelming. it's 100% acrylic which isn't my 1st choice, but soft, comfy & seems good quality. length falls abt 3"" below my knees. arm length is fine. pretty much looks as in the pic including the marled color. if you are in need of a great functional long swtr w/ good looks",pos
This is a great sweater. soft and beautiful. it's my new go to sweater??,pos
"I truly feel guilty wearing these outdoors. it is incredibly comfortable, so much so that i asked the sales girl if these were pjs or actually worn out. i'm usually between a s and m. both fit fine, but i went with the m to have a bit more room and allow the top to be a bit more ""flannel"" flowy. the top has enough length that i can actually let it droop over the waist bet a bit. the length is definitely upper thigh on me (5'8"" @ 145), but rest assured, nothing is hanging out. it's actually the p",pos
"I bought this dress online last week (in large part based on all the positive reviews), then i saw it in the store. i didn't try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didn't carry petites. i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed! for some reason i didn't realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger. so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it. well it came today and i figured",pos

"I needed a tee refresher, i had a good feeling about this one so ordered all three colors when they were on a promo, and i'm not disappointed. the neckline is different and works great to emphasize your favorite necklace. the tee holds shape after washing and drying. my favorite is the blue which i like to wear with dark wash jeans as styled on the model. the white has a cream tinge to it and i'm able to wear it with a nude bra without looking indecent. there is a cute little button detail at th",pos
"This is a really unique and well made top. i saw it online and thought it would be boxy. but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape. i bought the size small. i will say this is not a long shirt, skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering. i will be getting a lot of wear out of this.",pos
"This is much more a blouse than a ""tee"". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up.",pos
I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack. i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom. it was not flattering at all! i'd love to see this pattern back with a better fit.,neg

"Great knee length, lovely twirl and drape. though a staple piece, the material and the blend of the navy and black bring this skirt up a notch. pull on styling. i purchased a small and returned it for an extra small as it was too large in the waist. i like my skirts to sit at the natural waist and with the style of this skirt, i think that would look most flattering and slimming. my waist is abt 26/27 for reference (34c bust and hips abt 35/36) and typically a 2/4 at retailer. the skirt is quite s",pos

"I purchased this sweater after i saw it on a salesclerk at my local retailer store. i am usually a xs but based on reviews decided to size up considering the description of the fit of arms. when it arrived it was overall ok but seemed boxy at sides so i exchanged for my usual size. it arrived today and fits great-less fabric along sides but still good length for my 5'8, slender frame. the arms and shoulders are not too snug. the colors are beautiful and it is out of the ordinary-a statement piece,",pos
"I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! 

i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews",neg
"I'll admit, it's been a few months since i've shopped at retailer. i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesn't seem to be much consistency between the brands. i'm so glad i wandered in our local store this week! this top is so beautiful in person and well-made. the embroidery is lovely and it's lined, so not too sheer. i'm tall and it was a good length, hitting just above the hip. i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big. the s fit perfectly across the chest,",pos
Sweet leg warmers that are fun and cute too! kept me warm when out in this frosty morning!,pos

I ordered the orange color too. these are perfect for throwing on over workout clothes and then running errands.,pos
"I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye. overall, the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good. i also agree that the slits are to high. they should have made them stop at a lower point. it gives an odd effect. the tunic looks good especially with tights. it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics.",pos
"This is a really cute and flattering dress on me. i am 5'4"" 120 lbs and the 4 is a perfect fit. i am a little busty but the empire seam brings the dress back in slightly below my chest so it does not tent out.the asymmetrical hem makes it really flowy when you walk. the under dress is a lightweight fabric in a sheath cut that is shorter than the over dress which is a fun detail. the over dress material is somewhat gauzy and it moves as you move. the pockets are positioned in the front which is a",pos

"Bought this in navy. needed something comfortable, but able to dress up denim. this was perfect! wore it already and immediately got 2 complements. the only drawback was that the elastic in cuffs was a little too tight and my forearms are not large. bought in medium. i'm 5'8"" and 145 lbs. just washed it for first time. noticed that it dried a little wrinkly in front. may have to steam to get wrinkles out, but still worth it.",pos
"I really wanted to love this shirt. the snowflake and stripe design is really cute, and the fabric is of nice quality. it's a very loose fit, which i would've been willing to work with, but... as mentioned in previous reviews, the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm, and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long. it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms. not attrac",neg

"This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice, i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer, which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra, which too many of this design do. it is a bit large, you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.",pos

I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality,pos

"I'm glad i discovered this super easy to wear, flattering summer dress on a recent store visit. if i had only seen it online, i'm not sure i would have ordered it. i prefer it styled with flat sandals for an effortless boho look. i'm 5'5, slim and small chested and xs fit perfectly.",pos
Love love love!!! it is a little boxy but it is soo soft and comfortable!! it does run at least a size or 2 big!! i picked it up in the pink color yesterday at me local retailer store. was not sure about it when i first saw it online but fell in love with it quickly when i tried it on!!  great sweater for fall/winter,pos
"While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)",neg
Love this sweater it's perfect for chilly florida evenings....love the loose boxy shape and it's very cozy not itchy!,pos
"You know how sometimes you put something on and don't even have to look in the mirror to know you like it? well this is that piece of clothing. i bought a jumpsuit last year at retailer and wore it all the time so i wanted to get a new one this year. i saw this on the website and liked it all the way through when i put it on at the store. comfy, casual, not too young for my 56-year-old self, the right length, and i can comfortably wear a regular bra with it. perfect on all counts.",pos
"I rarely even try on denim at retailer because i'm quite curvy and the styles, while cute on the models, rarely have fit me. not so with these jeans! they're my first pair of pilcros and a steal at the sale price! i'm 5'3"", 150lbs, 32d for reference and i purchased a regular 28, even though i'm often a 27 in my favorite long and lean jeans. they hug my butt and hips in a very sexy way, but not to the point of not being able to wear them at my office. i will need to get them hemmed, but not",pos
This is such a beautiful dress. fell in love with it at first sight. it is very pretty. can be dressed up or down .. comes with an attached slip that is a tad longer than the dress and it shows on the bottom.. darling dress that will get lots of use this summer.,pos
This top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look. the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone . i would recommend this and can't wait to wear it.,pos
"This skirt has a great pattern and the stretchy fabric allows it to shape my body perfectly. adorable with a white-t, or a black one...great for a night out on the town and some sexy, strappy sandals! love this skirt!",pos
I love this tee. very soft and easy care. gentle cycle hand to dry.,pos
"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie.",neg
"Loved the color and the deshn. but when i put on, did not look right. waist was too short and the arms were long.",neg
"I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.",pos
I always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed! i love the way it wraps. fits perfectly. i got a size medium and i am 5'5 34dd; the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels. i recommend this!,pos
This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! i'm 5'2'm and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.,pos
I love this dress but it definitely runs big. i bought a size small and i'm between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs. the top feels like it will fall down and i'm a size 34c,pos
"I adore this dress, but i never would have bought it if i didn't wear it with a belt. as some reviewers have said, it's a sack. the belt takes care of this. it still isn't a slimming dress, but i really don't mind--the elegance and comfort make up for it.

i'm 5'10"", 34c, and curvy in the hips, and the medium fit perfectly. i could see this fitting strangely if you were larger in the bust.",pos
"This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall, a pretty horrible dress. save your money,",neg
"I bought this top for my daughter. the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering. this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends, or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach! my daughter loves it!",pos
"This sweater just grows on me every time i put it on. it is so comfortable, flattering and literally the perfect winter sweater. the length is long but so comfortable with leggings or skinny jeans. absolutely love it. i have the cream color one and i have to wear a tank under but the material and look is perfect.",pos
"I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,",pos
This blouse looks even better in person. it fits true to size and is lightweight. i am not a huge fan of designs on shirts and usually stick with solids but i find this design to be very flattering. i just bought it today but i know i will get a lot of use out of it.,pos
"Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra, even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts, black pants, and skinny jeans",pos
Such a great classic top! very flattering! can be worn all year. i bought it in grey but think i'll need it in other colors!,pos
"From the online pics, i would never think to try this on, but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets, so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up, almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.",pos
"I love this jacket and always get compliments when i wear it. i have the green version, and the color is lovely. the sleeves are the perfect length ( i got a petite size) and it is very flattering. the jacket is not warm enough for a really windy, snowy day, but is perfect for cool fall days.",pos
"I missed out on the sherpa vest in caramel last year and didn't want to miss out again - can't wait to wear this when it gets chilly. i am between a s & m but the small was very comfortable. it could be easilly layered over a thicker item, or a t-shirt as pictured. so glad i picked this one up.",pos
"These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch, and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small.",pos
"If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.
the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.",neg
Women who want some flutter without too much fullness,pos
"Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right, not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen, very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.",pos
"This sweater was pretty short. beyond that, when i raised my arms, the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down.",neg
"I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale.",pos
"I love these pants. a dry cleaner lost my favorite black pair ten years ago. i have not used them since.
if you wait long enough, everything comes back in style. i bought black and rust. these pants are comfortable, the perfect length, can dress up or down and are very, very cute.",pos
"The length of this dress is bizarre.  i can't decide if it's supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all - i'm not sure if i like it either way.  also- at this price point, i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent.  if you buy this dress, be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear.  the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate- the one i pur",neg
"I bought this skirt in the blue motif in my usual size large. it is very comfortable, light and it is lined! i wore it with a navy cotton lace meadow rue top from last year, gold gladiator sandals and a long gold retailer necklace.",pos
This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.,pos
"This is a fantastic dress. it's very flowy, comfortable, stylish, and it has pockets!!! whoop! whoop! i have a larger bust (34d) and even though it's button down, the openings in between don't peak open to show your bra. it is navy and red, but i think you could wear black boots with it, no problem. this is my new favorite dress and i'm very happy with my purchase. buy it!!",pos
"I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors, weight, fabric. love. love. love. 
unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers, the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite, which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end, i had to pass.",neg
"Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many ""bandage"" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly.",pos
"I went to my local retailer store in kansas city,mo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it. i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because it's so soft and very flattering on my body type. i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money!!",pos
I purchased this striped racer tank to wear during the day on july 4th! it was perfect! the back is really special and dresses it up!,pos
So i notice most ladies on retailer love to say how tiny they are. so some of us that are busty and have a hip--this is nice. i actually could've done a medium but the large was the only one and on sale. it's meant to be loose! it's kind to ladies that aren't all size 2 :),pos
This dress is a staple. if you don't feel like getting too dressed up and want to be comfortable. this is it. will be great for travel as well. i like to pack light. so i look forward to traveling with this dress.,pos
"I love, love, love this top! it is beautiful and very unique. the first day i wore it i got so many compliments! highly recommend!",pos
"Wow... i'm in love!!! when i first saw this i put it in my cart... when i went back to purchase it, it was sold out in my size... i was so bummed. i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it... thank heavens!!! when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too ""grandma-y"" of a design... but i was wrong. it's just gorgeous! can totally be dressed up or down. so flattering. love love love it!!!",pos
"I love this top. other reviewers have mentioned the softness of the material and the cozy, perfect for fall/perfect for the sf bay area ""winter"", but i would like to call out my favorite element of the top being the scoop in the back. it adds just a little bit of soft sexiness while being just right for a comfortable weekend sweater to a dressed up office appropriate shirt.",pos
"Now, i ordered both striped versions and i don't know which to keep... the material is a nice soft knit. the neck line is almost boat-neck, with little buttons, so cute. colors are really nice too. i tried it on with skinnies and trousers,a nd ti looked great with both. i went with the petite version, for those shorter gals out there... xxs petite fit me, i havne't tried o the xs petite yet.

"I've received so many complements when i wear this tunic. it's so comfortable and fits great. the fabric is light and feels good against my skin. this is, by far, my most favorite purchase from retailer and i wear it all the time with my leggings. love, love, love this tunic/dress!!",pos
"I would suggest trying this on in store. the xs would've worked (that's my normal size), but i ended up preferring the s. it does have low armholes. the s in the yellow was just right for me, but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked. still, a very cute and classic top that i know i'll get a lot of use out of.",pos
Excited to get this sweater! i'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i don't like clingy sweaters. this was perfect; fitted but not tight. i'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date. wish i could've gotten it for the 25% off + free s/h but glad i didn't wait - this size was sold out first.,pos
"This is the first hd in paris top i haven't loved. high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color. this was an online only item so i guessed at the size, typically order a 4 petite. ordered the 4 regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length. it was oddly constructed, small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom. the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put it
on. too bad, but it went back",neg

"I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year's eve. i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too.",pos
"I bought this top in my usual size large and it is slightly big, but not so much that i would want to size down.  the material is slightly itchy, but i think that it's worth it because it's such a pretty top. i absolutely love the detail at the top.  it is beautiful!  if you wear a nude bra, you can't see the strap lines through the material.  i also love the coloring of this top.  this is a great top that i can see myself wearing with dress pants for work or with jeans for a more casual look.",pos
Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!,pos
This is such a fun dress to wear. i wanted something comfortable and flirty and this checked off both boxes. im typically a small size 6 but went w x-small on this one to hug the shoulders more.,pos
"I purchased these shorts in a size 24. i'm on the petite side of things and the shorts are a little big. the tie-front allows you to tighten the short. i actually think the photo does a good job showing this item. the color is a washed out gray and the shorts are not too ""short."" the fabric is light and this will be great for hotter days. i like them.",pos
Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .,neg
"This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality, and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area, even for me (36dd), and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!",pos
The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.,neg
"... for the model to look like this?
pros: nice quality. the colors of the blue version, at least, are rich and beautiful. note that the dark color pictured is really brown, not black. the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture. it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter. it is layered over a bright navy poly slip.
cons: i am 5'8 135# . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med. the sleeves were more dolman than fitted. i imagin",neg
"These shorts are perfect. not too short, but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my ""hyphen"" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose, order true to size. they do stretch at the waist, so if you want them to fit true to size, order one-two sizes down.",pos
I was a little skeptical about this one at first. i have a hard time with the over all styling of many maxi dresses. i liked the print and figured i would give this a whirl. it is beautiful! looks great on and i love the fabric!! so happy i picked this one up.,pos
Versatile and fun dress. color is better in person than picture. looks great with jeans jacket for chilly moments. doesn't wrinkle on long airplane trip and rolls up teeny-tiny for packing!,pos
This is a great blouse for all shapes!   you can wear it under a suit or with jeans!,pos
"I run 170lbs., 36 d, 5'4"" and ordered a regular 14. probably could get away with a 12. i didn't order a petite because i wanted the length. however i ordered the 14 because it is cotton hand wash and thinking there might be some shrinkage. it fits to perfection everywhere - but the waist. it's very loose. they must have clipped it in at the waist in the back of this shot on the model. the picture doesn't clearly show the hi-low concept of the hem. i like that so it isn't a problem. very unique a",pos
No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.,pos
"In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.",pos
"This jumpsuit looked so great on the model, and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4"" and in great shape, and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!",neg
Tried this top on in store in a small and it was a bit snug in the chest (32dd) but loved it otherwise. the sales associate had it shipped to me in a medium and it is perfect!! a great length over leggings or skinny jeans and is lightweight enough for warmer days or can be layered with a tank underneath and a cropped cardigan for colder ones.,pos
"Ordered this top online, color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous, comfortable and flattering, so much so, i am ordering the navy too. great quality , fabulous with jeans .",pos
These shorts are super comfy and the color is awesome!,pos
"I ordered both colors in xxs (xs p and xxs p were both sold out at the time sale came on): verdict, fits really nicely, but short. i would have to wear this with higher rise pants or pencil skirt (like the red one is pictures with a polka dot skirt). i decided to keep the red one, because it is a bot more unique, i do have a few navy tops. the xxs fits ""fitted"" (can't think of another way of saying it), so i like it as it will go nicely with looser bottoms. i love the sleeves, the ruffles make t",pos
I love wide-leg pants and i'm so glad they're back. i bought this pair in the navy and cream colors as soon as i saw them online. i bought my usual size 28 in retailer and they fit just fine. the navy color is more like a dark blue but still perfect for spring/summer. comfortable material and overall good quality. i just wish they came in more colors.,pos
"I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts, thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well, i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft, a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t, nice fit, not too baggy, not too tight, and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!",pos
Luv the loose fit and quality fabric - great piece for layering.,pos
Love love love...the fit is amazing and truly well made. this jumpsuit is a classic and it fits perfectly. i just wish the button was a little bit more secure but other than that it's a 10,pos
"I love this top, it's not too fitted and falls in the right part of my waist giving me good movement. i wear it to work and everyone compliments how the back is longer the top doesn't ride up your back!",pos
The sweater had a square fit it has a chiffon ruffle at the bottom which i didn't see in the picture.,pos
"I bought these yesterday and i love them! they are super comfortable, and are the perfect length and size. i'm 5'8 and 150. i tried on both the small and medium (small for kicks, but turns out they were a better fit!). the medium fit great too-albeit a little baggy on the thigh. these are now my go to pants for summer, and travel! i can't wait to start wearing them!",pos
I love this shirt so i bought both colors. i wish they had more colors! fits great and very comfy.,pos
"I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible, and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well. so so disappointed. the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch, i could have easily sized down.",neg

"It is a beautiful dress, light and delicate. i got my usual xsmall ( 5'4"" 34c, 134 lbs). it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted. it worked for me, but i can see this being an issue. it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip. it is worth it. very cute dress.",pos

I found this skirt to run tts - i am a size 16 and the bought the xl. it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person. i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer. happy girl!,pos
I tried these on when they were full price and waited for them to go on sale and was very excited when they did! i'm not the type to buy leather pants but these look like i can dress them up or down and dress them like jeans. i'm a size 26 in pants but i bought size 25. i highly recommend!,pos
"One of the reasons i avoid skirts at all costs is because i have a bigger tummy and don't like the extra tight feeling i have of a skirt around my waist. i like this skirt because of its stretchiness. even wore it to a bbq where i could eat my heart out and not feel constricted at all.

received many compliments including: ""you look like you're vacating in the caribbean!""",pos
"Love this. the stripes are cute and simple, but even better is the texture of the fabric (do a close up on the photo if you can). it's a swing tank, so there is a lot of fabric, but styled the right way and this is dreamy :) i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasn't quite long enough for me. i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it - but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two :)",pos
"This is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much - dressed up or even over something casual. and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy, soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy. i would say it does have more of a 'sweater' feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket. it's lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day. i would say it fits pretty true to size. i got the ivory during the big weekend sale (extra 40% off) but even at $",pos

"I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great. (it's not - the pockets are cut bad, it's cut smaller in the chest, and made in china)",pos
"This is my favorite pair so far from cartonnier. the side zip dresses up the pants which is something i was looking for and i just love the print. so happy with the quality, i ordered a second pair. fit true to size for me. i plan to wear them with knee high boots as it gets colder.",pos
"Love this dress - ""swingy"" is definitely the right descriptor. as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger, but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size. it runs slightly large so if you're between sizes i would size down.",pos
"Gorgeous! this dress fit so well and it super flattering. i got it in green and the colors are just lovely. i had to get it hemmed because i'm short and i couldn't find it in petite, but definitely worth the extra cost. i love, love love it.",pos
"This top is the perfect staple! the fabric is soft and comfortable. i generally wear medium tops, but the small fits perfectly. took the chance ordering online and i am very happy!",pos
This dress is so soft and cozy and pretty.  love the shine and interesting sheen whenever you move.  very comfortable and looks great with a variety of layers. i want to buy more colors but right now i just have the mauve. ordered size m and i'm 38-27-35 #135.,pos
I have worn this with a tank and shorts and know it will be a great fall piece over a long sleeve tee. the pattern is pretty and the fabric is soft and warm. it can be casual or dressed up. this product is true to the picture- what you see is what you get.,pos
"Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.

the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. 

looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b",neg
"I love(d) this top. it was my go to top even in the heat, the fabric is light and breathes. however, pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body. it could not be repaired. i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it.",neg
This suit is so flattering on! great support and slimming for my post-three times baby body. i ordered this suit and the skirted maillot by swim by retailer in the white floral. i loved the pattern of the floral more but don't think any chest size larger than a c cup would be supported in that suit.,pos
"While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item, these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online, the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.",neg
Like the style of a blazer but the fabric of denim. looking forward to pairing with dresses and black pants,pos
"Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair, these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long, so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend, i'd go with these!",pos
"And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.",neg
"The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person.
just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations!
it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy!
the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous!
the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow!
beautiful and flattering fit.
it is a 10 !!!!

"Fabulous colors, great fabric, super comfy and extremely versatile. i love, love, love this skirt. although i'm only 5'1"", the regular 2 was still above my knee so it might be a bit short for really tall gals. the waistband is a bit wide, but with a cropped top or tying a button down as shown, i found it very flattering. love the texture of the fabric and the slightly retro print and it doesn't seem to wrinkle (after getting out the original packaging creases). it honestly goes with everything a",pos
"We were at dinner in provence at sunset... and in walked a young lady wearing this lavender? dusty blue? lilac? creation- just swingy enough to be perfectly comfortable, yet lacy enough to be elegant. the color struck me as ""south-of-france"". they were american by accent. i was too shy to ask the brand of her dress, but knew by the powers of the internet that this dress would one day be mine. magnolia lace dress- i found you!!!",pos
I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.,neg
"The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though, because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall, very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)",pos
I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.,neg
"I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer, which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however, the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also, the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit, but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).",neg
"I was hesitant in purchasing these without trying them on first, but i'm happy i did. they are higher quality than the typical legging. the sizing runs bigger than average.",pos
I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build (in arms) as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug. this dress was perfect and so soft!!! fit me like a glove! i have a long torso and am 5'8'' so it's a little short - but throw on some tights and booties and it's perfect! i'm a size 10/12 and got a large :),pos
"These are the most flattering pair of white jeans i have ever found!! people stop me when i wear them and ask me where i purchased them and the name of the brand! flattering, comfortable and perfect for a casual weekend or going out! highly recommend!",pos
"This sweater is very long, could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !",neg
"I purchased this dress for my 50th birthday bash!!! it was stunning!!! the fit was perfect. i did buy it a size up, but could have worn my regular size. it is incredibly flattering and elegant. very well made. one of my go to black dresses for the summer!!!",pos
"I find that petite gals with short (,muscular) legs can have a hard time finding cropped pants that fit right. the flare on these makes the pants oh so flattering. the material is nice and thick and holds you in. the colors and patterns are beautiful fall colors, quite lovely and subtle, there is a nice stretch to the pant, the waist has nice closures, can't wait to weer these! i ordered the 0p and htey fit perfectly. (115 lbs, 26.5 in wiast)",pos
"Just bought this in navy and love the easy versatility of it! the other colors in the print (including some black) can be worn as is, with a cardi, denim jacket, leggings/tights and boots, etc. i found the fit to be somewhat loose in my usual size 4, particularly in the chest (i'm 34a), and length was long enough to not need leggings in spring/summer (at 5'7""). the neckline is cut somewhat low, but retains modesty in my opinion because of how narrow of a v it is (don't feel need for cami). very",pos
"Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i'm a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable.",pos
Loved this online and even better in person. inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt!,pos
"I love this sweater!! love the length, it's a bit loose and delicate compared to what i usually wear, but looks great with boots and leggings. love the sheer fabric across the bottom of the back, the loose bows on the sides and the drape of the fabric. all combine to make a great sweater. runs true to size, has a loose fit but you don't feel like you are drowning in fabric like some loose fitting cardigans.",pos
This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. .,pos
This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.,neg
"I had to go up one size, but i love this blouse! dressy enough for work, and you can make it casual with jeans. tight across the chest, but the next size up fit perfect!",pos
"This is a very well made sweater. it is a nice weight, great for cool mornings and evenings. i don't think you can dress this up but it is perfect with casual pants and jeans. i found it runs large but that makes it suitable for layering over other tops.",pos
"This is such a pretty dress. i was worried the arm holes would be too big since it was hard to see them in the pictures, but they are perfect! there is a built in red slip underneath. it is so cute on and really flattering by itself or even with some white skinny crop jeans underneath!",pos
"Wow i have never owned a pair of pants that fit so well! this is my first pair of pants from retailer. i always have the ""too tight in the thighs"" and ""gaping at the waist"" issue but not with these at all. i was so surprised. i purchases size 26 in both tan and blue. the perfect amount of stretch and so comfortable. a bit long but flares look best with heals anyway;)",pos
I wore this dress to work the other day and got so many compliments on the fit and the design - the wrap on the top. i got it in grey and it's a beautiful color for winter. the dress is very comfortable to wear.,pos
Love this shirt! it is great quality and fits true to size in a comfy not too fitted way that a button down should fit. i love that it is a classic white cotton shirt with a modern edge with the little bit of fringing on the bottom and sleeve cuffs. it's great to wear with jeans or leggings and i can even see dressing it up or down depending on the accessories worn. i have already gotten lots of compliments when wearing it....everyone wants to get it for themselves! i'd even get it in another co,pos
"I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it's beautiful material and has lovely detail, a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesn't have a lot of stretch.",pos
"Super comfortable and cute!! i have received tons of compliments one this dress. the material is soft and the print/colors are awesome. this dress will get a lot of use over fall, winter and spring. runs a little big. i am typically a s but chose the xs . love love love!",pos
"Couldn't resist this jacket! it's perfect for business casual dress code, for staying warm in air-conditioned offices and goes with many colors and styles.

many times jackets are too tight on my shoulders or not long enough for my arms and this fits perfectly. (i'm 5' 7"" and i bought a medium)",pos
"Bought this in store at full price: it's that pretty. black & white, embroidery, pintucks! throw it on with capris and flats and you are polished and comfy. my only prob was i had to buy a little large - size 8- as size 6 was already sold out. 
i am 5' 5"" , 130 lbs.",pos
"I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man",neg
"Wasn't sure what to expect - but got this on sale, and glad i did.
it is much prettier in person. soft and silky.
great fit also - and versatile (mix and match)",pos
I love the length of the dress and the fun swing the skirt has. the print is wonderful.,pos
"Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!",pos
I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.,pos
"This has been my go to top for cooler days, so comfortable and soft. i would say it runs tts with a little bit of a lose fit. i am 5'10, 36c and usually wear s and the s fit me well. i could have gone down in size, but liked this to be a bit loser to wear over skinny jeans and leggings.",pos
I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them. they are comfortable and a great casual look. i bought two more pairs in different colors on line.,pos
"The light red color is really nice. i ordered an xs but usually order small, because of the cut and it was perfect. the fabric is heavy but loose. the collar stands up nicely and the buttons lay flat. i purchased this beautiful piece on sale, but i would have paid full price.",pos
"I am 5'2"" 125 pounds and i bought the 4p. the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way. add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating, very flattering lines. i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier, since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays. as other reviewers said, it is adorable and a winner.",pos
"Perfect fit, great material, torn in just the right places. can't wait to see the stevie jeans for the fall esp. in corduroy!",pos
"I love these shorts. they're really comfortable and versatile. i got them on sale, and for the price they were a steal! the material is nice, and you can dress them up or down.",pos
"This dress is a winner! the material is not stiff like many neoprene dresses - it is soft and silky and has amazing drape. the dress is very flattering! the material is very stretchy even through the waist, so it is and easy ""perfect fit"" on different body types. i loved the shorter versions of the dress, but they weren't workable for me, but this length is perfect. and there are pockets that are sewn in with perfect detailing - they don't stick out or disturb the line of the dress.",pos
"Great dress. wonderful on hourglass and skinny straight shaped girls.
love the color combination and fit.",pos
"Saw this on the retailer emails as a cover and knew i had to try it on. went into the store following day and tried it. to my delight the tencel fabric is light enough for southern california weather and can be worn as a trench coat over skinny jeans, leggings or dresses or act as a dress in itself! love the navy color as it is has more of a washed looked and not too bold. what attracted me to this piece in the first place was the ruffled bottom and the rounded flaps on the back that is different",pos
"When i saw this on a model at my retailer store, i fell for it. i love the colors and the weave of this kimono. it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular. it will be useful for cooler days and nights or air-conditionied places. the knit cuffs hold it in place. i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it.",pos
"I loved this dress when i saw it. however the fit was way off. i am 5'7"" 120 lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down. when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect. unfortunately the waist hit way too high, above my rib cage and the dress was too short. it was as if it was a petite size. i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty, easy dress to just throw on for school. unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both. the material is also not the s",neg
"I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style. it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness. it is from cloth and stone, a brand i like. usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me. i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder. i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation.",pos
"This sweater totally caught my eye online and when it arrived, it was even better than on the website. gorgeous colors---kind of a retro look, but more modern and updated. very happy with my purchase!",pos
I love this more than my pineapple top. i am 128lbs and wear between a size 2-4 in tops got this in size 4 (same as the pineapple) and fits perfectly and comfotably. the color is white and has a lovely lace pattern. i would say it runs a litle on the small side. material is a bit more stiff than my pineapple top but i love the way it feels. in my opinion this is a staple top you can dress it up for a wedding or just going out its super lovely. they were so popular at the retailer near me tw,pos
"I bought this in the blue and you should definitely size down. it runs very large. it's amazingly comfortable and high quality. great length as well (not too short and not too long). it has a partial lining so it's not necessary to wear a slip which i love. i get compliments every time i wear it, even one of the saleswomen in retailer asked me where i got the dress. she was surprised when i told her it was from retailer from online. i liked it so much i just ordered the red plaid.",pos
"Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o",pos
"This shirt is exactly what i expected! it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great! it's the perfect shirt for summer, loose fitting but in a flattering way. the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors!

i highly recommend it!",pos
"This tunic fits exactly as shown and is so comfortable. the fabric is soft and buttery, and the lace up front is a awesome detail. happy that i went with the non-denim color because it's a gorgeous rich color that i think will transition well from season to season. love a good, cutr machine-washable tunic!",pos
"The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.",neg
"After reading the reviews, stating that this dress was a tent and only fit for the tall and small chested, i kind of had a battle of wills in my head over ordering it. it is very ""me,"" but me is also 5'5, curvy, and possessing a 36g bust. i had to post a review, because i received the dress today, and i actually love it. i ordered a 16 and i love the fit. i know it's flowy, but on me, it's far from tent-like. i think it's great now as a pre-fall piece with some sandals and a jean jacket, and as",pos
Fits really nicely and i'm picky about sleeves but these are just right. a little see through but i don't have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well. love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice.,pos
I can not speak highly enough about this shirt. i originally bought the navy one and then went back to purchase the other two colors. the material is soft and thin without being flimsy. the fit is very flattering.,pos
"When i read car coat, i expect a little more weight. it really is just a thin, long blazer. also, the colors appear different online. i expected a red/maroon with bue and white stripe, so maybe i mis-read completely...? it is actually brown/mustard/beige combo. not what i expected, so it will be a return.",neg
"The photo of this dress does not do it justice. this dress is absolutely gorgeous. the construction is very high quality. i always worry about peekaboos with button front dresses as i am very busty. total non-issue with this dress. the petite fit is also spot on. it is slightly large in the back bodice for me, but i always have that problem. it's an easy tailoring fix.

i think i'm in love with byron lars <3",pos
Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased,neg
Thank goodness they had a special discount because i love this sweater. it is not normal for me to splurge but there was something about this sweater and it didn't disappoint. too cute. a great top to wear to a concert or a relaxed party. i love it.,pos
"Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!",neg
"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching. 

i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top.",neg
"The shirt is a heavier weight than how it looks on the product page which was a nice surprise. it has a boxy shape and was shorter than expected. i'm 5'7"" and the front of the shirt above the hips. the design and color is great. very happy overall.",pos
"I just bought these last week and have had a hard time wearing anything else! they are super comfortable, with great pockets. very flattering and wash up great. wish they made more colors...",pos
I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.,neg
"I just received this and wore it immediately - it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern 'peeks' out, giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt. the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not see-through. it is a fine knit, and has a satin-like thread to it which makes it soft and cool - perfect for a summer day! it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite (51 100 lb) and i think this would run closer to tts.",pos
"This vest is sooo cute!  i bought the red (really a dark burgundy) and it is perfect for fall.  i wanted to buy the other color but it's sold out online.  i'm 5'3"" and the length is fine.  i'm usually an xs 2 or 4 at retailer and the regular xs/s is the perfect size.  i am on the busty side and doesn't make me feel too heavy like some vests.",pos
Very cute and great fit. i removed the belt (it's removable) for a different look.,pos
I love this dress!,pos
"Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately, when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time, there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.",neg

"I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors (the black for some reason only available to order in store). the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch! i've purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small. i'm 5'2"" 125lbs 34c and and typically wear an xs at retailer. this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem. i can't wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies!",pos

This dress is amazing! i have to say when i picked it up to try it on i thought it would just be an ok dress but i thought might as well try it on. to my surprise it was more than perfect! the waste cinches in when it is zip it up and the blousing in the chest fits lovely.,pos

"The fit of the top is true to size, but i really don't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace. the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy, but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe. it is terrible paired together. i also didn't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin. even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail, i'm absolutely sending it back.",neg
"I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model. so floaty and light. when it came, i found it to be the exact opposite. the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack. it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately.",neg
"This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops, and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though, which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp, it actually looks bigger. regardless, i love it and was o",pos
"This is a great shirt with cute details including the ruffled back. i am petite and needed to shorten the sleeves, but otherwise the fit was true to size and not too baggy or too tight. the material feels avergage in quality, but looks polished with navy blue pants. i received several compliments during my first wear. overall, a very cute shirt!",pos
"This shirt fits beautifully, though might be tight for the large chested. the fabrics is very soft, and the look classic and feminine.",pos
I love this sweater and don't think the pics do it justice. i ordered the light blue/lavender color and couldn't be happier. it's great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots. i received many compliments the one time i've worn it so far. so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price!,pos

i bought the blue tunic first (the pictures don't do the textile design justice!) i loved it so much i went back online and purchased this tunic in black!!!

thanks retailer for being awesome!",pos

I bought this in aqua. the color is beautiful. the quality of the cashmere is great. i have worn this 3 times since purchasing! this can be dressed up or down. the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf. flattering hem line. very versatile.,pos
"Great causal tank! the back is a bitter longer than the front - i'm 5'6"" and the back-model shot was right on for where it his me at the hip/butt. the material is a poly/spandex/rayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give.

"I am not sure why this is listed on the website at hd in paris, because i purchased this shirt in carmel, ca and it is actually maeve, which is a brand i buy often and always fits me well. this piece did not disappoint. this is a fun and versatile black top, but has a little edge with its design and i know that i will get a lot of use out of it. i don't find the fabric to be ""rough"" at all, but it is textured which i just think adds to the interest of this piece. i am a 34d and did not find my c",pos
"This is a lovely jacket. i thought it was going to be thicker, but it's so classy and chic. i got several comments on it, and i've only worn it once! great jacket to have in my closet. i can wear it to work, to dress up an outfit for school, or to complete an outfit.",pos
I am so glad i got these pants. the quality is great and the fit is perfect. they are very flattering and comfortable. i have worn them with flip flops on a casual day and have also worn them with black heels for a date night. worth the purchase!,pos
"I fell in love with this tunic on instagram, and couldn't wait to find it during the tops promotion. it was absolutely not a disappointment. as the other reviewer mentioned, the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images, and this actually makes the shirt more beautiful--they're rich and fallish, but not at all over the top.

i'm thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic. i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a range--i di",pos
These are more than what i had expected! they're beautiful and fit like a glove. i'm thrilled that i purchased them.,pos

A great addition to any wardrobe. can go with nice trousers and dressier shoes for work or jeans and trainers for a casual look. i didn't find it to run small and indeed thought it fit as i'd expect.,pos
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately. i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didn't deter my liking it because it's still a lovely shade of pink. the fabric takes a bit getting used to though - i thought it would be silkier but it's really a thicker fabric. i ordered a size small and i usually wear size 4. the dress drowned me. so i returned it for an xs, which fit me beautifully. so",pos
"I see that many of you, like myself, fell in love with the look and feel of this sweater, and reluctantly bought it even though it sheds like crazy! i just wanted to let you all in on a little trick to stop the shedding (it will sound strange, but it worked like a charm!) fold up the sweater, seal it in a ziploc bag, and pop it in the freezer for 24 hours. bam! it will shed no more! now i can completely love this sweater. :)",pos
"Great sweater coat.  fits a bit large.  purchased a small...which is unusual for me.  i normally wear a medium or sometimes a large.  retailer clothes are mosly cut small.  it looks great on...warm, comfy and attractive.  i am very pleased with this purchase.  highly recommend.",pos
Great unique style top for casual or dress,pos
This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.,pos

"I accidentally found this gem at my store today. i adore layering my style, and this is a perfect edition. it's light, but has enough weight to it that it has some movement and doesn't stick to other fabric. i wouldn't quite call it ""gauze"" since its heavier than your typical gauze. it's super long. i'm 5'8 and it definitely went to my knees. when worn buttoned up, it's clean and classic. when worn open, it's cool, bohemian and edgy...while still looking totally put together. i adore this. wish",pos
"These colors!!!  my cup of tea!  i love everything about this top, from the fit, to the raw edge of the neck trim. it does seem like it will wrinkle easily but i can manage that for its sheer beauty!",pos

This dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft. the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything. its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely. the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about 2 inches above my knee and i am 5'3.'' i will wear this with tights for work. color is very nice also.,pos
"I always love the arielle jeans. every color seems to be slightly different in the fit, but they are always slim enough in the leg and thigh to be stylish without being too restricting. to echo the other reviews, the pockets are a little low on these compared to other arielle cut jeans that i already own. i have a fairly straight, athletic shaped body and went with my 'larger' size to wear them as more of a boyfriend fit. the fabric is a very soft and forgiving denim and the dark color can be dr",pos
"Bring back the old retailer timeless pieces! this cardigan is very flattering, the flutter sleeves add a romantic touch to the cardigan. the colors are neutral, and the vine part (black) is like velvety. the fit is super flattering, i originally bought hte xs in the store, but decided to also order the xs petite to compare ( i am 4115 lbs, 5'1.5"" and 30 dd, with 26-27 waist). both fit, but the petite was better fitted on my waist. also, the length would work better on top of dresses. i also tried",pos

"I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro",neg

This coat is beautiful in color and design. we could have been great friends but it was waaay too big so i had to return it. i bought the smallest size possible yet i could have been 9 months pregnant and still would have had room to spare. i also was disappointed that the sleeves were not lined like other coats in this price range.,neg

"This is such a cute summer tank to wear with capris or shorts. it is loose fitting and while i normally prefer the petite sizing at 5'1, i got the 00 since i liked the longer length. i purchased the wine and navy colors and the neckline isn't too deep at all. love it!",pos
Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.,pos

This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!,pos

"I just purchased this adorable tank on-line and already received it in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it fits me tts. the material is actually made with 100% rayon, not polyester as it describes above which makes it even better. the embroidery very beautiful in person as well and the arm openings are just right, not too large for a nice change. if you need a cute tank in black with a little something special, this is the top for you!",pos
I'm obsessed with this top. i actually love that the sides are a bit higher than the front and back. i feel like that gives it shape. i bought jeans similar to the pic here and they look so good together. love!,pos
"I tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was! i'm 5'4"" and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely. because it's a little longer on me, it's great to wear both to work and on the weekends. just wish it came in more colors! you can't see the color in the photo, but there's a sea green lining which is a cute touch!",pos

i'm 5' 7"", 137 lbs., and ordered a size medium, with plenty of room around the bust; no worry about arm holes being too big because you adjust the straps to suit your body. i love the below the knee length. i like comfy but you could easily size down.

Great purchase. true to size. so flattering. love it simplicity.. buy it if you enjoy compliments!,pos
I love these jeans! i wear them all the time. i love the way they fit and the price is great. please make these exact pants in more colors!,pos
The fabric is soooo thick. the pattern is very spring/summer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise. the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me,neg
"I bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks - it's really stunning. the red is incredibly vibrant, especially for linen, and the construction is very high-quality. since it's linen, it feels crisp and light, and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flat-out hot days. the rayon slip is a really nice touch, too, since the linen is fairly transparent. it really drove home the sense of quality for me. i bought mine in size 0-regular, which i found slightly big i",pos

This is the best ever t-shirt i've ever worn. feels so soft! looks gorgeous! very comfortable and yet has that bit of sparkle that makes it perfect for a special evening with friends etc! just love the fit- it makes me look slimmer:),pos

flattering on me, i have thighs and these balanced out the thigh effect. color (wash) was also very nice in my opinion. can be wrn with any top, really, i had to make myself return them jsut coz of price, but on my wish list for sure!",pos
Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings. it's hard to see where i would wear them ... sorry but they have to go back.,neg
This is the softest jacket! i could sleep in this fabric. the ruched details and fun collar make it unique. plus it has inside pockets! one of the best finds in a while.,pos
These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure,pos
"I'll start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful. the top is sheer, but that's pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse. the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso (not the chest, but the mid-section) is cut fairly wide. i'm 5'10"", 140#, 34b and usually wear a 4 or a small/medium depending on how relaxed i want the fit. i purchased this in a 4. the arms were workable but slightly fitted, and the torso fit like an 8. chest was as expect",neg
This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture. it also has a strong chemical smell. i've had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out.,neg
"This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!",pos
"I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on, yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually. 

i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position. 

the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!",pos
I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.,pos
"This vest is super cute! i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear an xs at retailer, i have this in a small and it fits perfectly, fits snug when zipped, my usual xs would have definitely been too tight. would definitely recommend!",pos
Well made & lined. great find for the fall!,pos
This blouse is very beautiful and flattering. it's just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath. as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so.,pos
"I love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out. the lining is like clouds on your calves. they're thick enough that you don't need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they don't add bulk. love, love them!",pos
Super comfortable..great layering piece or by itself...got lots of compliments at work.,pos
"I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress. friends, strangers, younger, older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress. it has a 70's vibe to it, fun and swingy. perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler, i think it will look great with leggings and boots. i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite (i'm 5'4' and 135) and it hit just above my knee. my favorite dress right now!",pos
This dress is great for hiding any insecurities. it's also very comfy.,pos
This top is semi fitted and then stretches as you wear it. i love the design and color choices.,pos

"This top is lovely! exquisite embroidery in a silvery-beige color compliments the deep plum. the fit is close to highlight your curves, while being just a touch comfy. very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties. i wear a size 8 normally and the medium fits me perfectly. my body type is curvy and athletic.",pos
"The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.

"Cute skirt! i bought it to go with boots (tall and short) and looks great. if you pair it with the right top, it reminds me of the funky eclectic retailer look that this retailer is famous for! i usually wear a size 2 or 4 and i went with the 2 because it didn't hang so low. but that's just me.",pos
I love how pretty and soft this shirt is. it falls well. i want to wear it everyday.,pos
"Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but don't think petite will work. really, really great shirt.",pos
"I get compliments on this top every single time i wear it. the pattern is so pretty, and while it's very lightweight, it still drapes nicely. i would caution that someone with a larger chest may find that the shape is not quite right - i am a 34d and just on the cusp of having it be too balloon-y on top.",pos
"I bought this in size xl. it is so much bigger than i expected. there are panels of material. it really is huge. not flattering at all. still, i kept it. the material is so soft & flowy. i've gotten good use wearing it around the house, doing chores, resting, etc. i wouldn't wear it out doing errands. but, around home, it's perfect for feeling cozy. such a strange cut. i don't know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy. i think many would enjoy wearing it at home.",neg
"This is a very pretty top with nice lace details. the linen makes it not quite as soft as 100% cotton but still comfortable and breathable. the fit was just right in the small petite. i tried it on in the store and was very tempted, but wound up not buying it because i have other similar tops. i would snap it up if it went on sale or if i needed a top of this type.",pos
"Slouchy, longer in the sleeves, a little cropped, great neckline, stylish.....these are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater! i've been looking for a style like this for a long time. i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized. i'm petite, 119 lbs., with a 32f bust size. i went with the grey, but i'm loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink. so comfy and cozy and chic!!",pos
"I've had this jacket for a few weeks and it has been a terrific transition piece for the spring. this is a lightweight layering piece without any lining. it works well as a topper for cooler morning temps and you can still wear it later in the day without perspiring through it. i bought it in the olive color, which works with just about everything and the xs was tts (for reference-5'4,116 lbs.). the fit is slightly boxy with a nice swing and drape in the back. for those concerned about the back",pos

"I am very happy with this poncho/sweater. it is my first cashmere sweater and it feels so soft and luxurious! true, it does not have full length sleeves, but if you adjust the sweater so that it comes down lower on your shoulders, it will come well past your elbows, covering most of your arms. i feel very elegant wearing it. looks great with skinny pants or leggings and boots. would recommend,",pos
"Great wardrobe staple! at 119, i ordered the s and the fit was great. you can wear this so many ways and it's soft!",pos
"This is one of the best tops i've ordered. it fits well, it can be worn dressy or casual. what is pictured is what you get. if you are considering this top, it can be worn all year round! the price is not outrageous, and the quality seems it could last for more than one season.",pos
Runs a bit small. very slimming. love these. when will they be available in moss again?,pos
"This piece is a great, easy throw on that allows you to still look polished. it's heavy weight is a perfect substitute for a coat on those in-between fall weather days when you don't want to lug a jacket around. lining is super soft and makes it so comfortable to wear.",pos
"I was able to purchase this on sale and i'm so glad i did. i usually go between a size s and m (133 lbs., 5' 5"", 34 d) but the small fits perfectly. the color really isn't dark orange as stated......kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color. it's not super heavy weight but not really thin either....actually perfect!",pos
This skirt caught my eyes right away in the clearance section. i would have tried size 2 but it wasn't available. however size 4 fitted just fine. the print has bright summery feel to it. the lines on skirt are more carrot orange than it is to red. fabric is soft.,pos
When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?,neg

They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!,pos

"I bought these pants for a planned trip to southeast asia, where i want to look put together but also be very comfortable. the lightweight fabric is perfect for traveling in warm climates where one shouldn't necessarily be wearing shorts in certain public places or when visiting religious sites. these pants can also go to the pool, out on errands and to brunch. i bought the navy and would considering also buying the beige. great find and very reasonable sale price!",pos
"If you're a little afraid to rock a jumpsuit this one's for you. the palazzo leg makes it look a lot like a dress. a light shelf bra was very supportive even for my d/dd cup. it does run large. i'm typically a 14/16 and was easily able to fit in the 12, although the look it a bit racier on me due to cleavage. hides any tummy you might have very well due to the flowing cut. the fabric is light and comfortable. my only complaint is i wish it was a tad longer. i can not wait to rock this at a weddi",pos
"The photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides, and just below her hair, there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat- well, it's not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl. i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing. the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater. bummer. i'll be returning it.",neg
"I fell in love with this in the store. i am petite at 5'3"" and 110 lbs and i went with the regular size 0. i agree with another reviewer that the petite sizing would have been too short. the color is rich, the quality is fabulous and i love the style. it is not fitted, but i also found that it wasn't too wide either. if you're looking for a fitted top, this wouldn't be the one. but if you love a well-styled top with a bit of volume that you can rock with a pair of skinnies to balance it out, the",pos
"I'm 5'3"" and 160 pounds with short legs and got a large petite. it fits really well (a tiny bit too short but could just be my proportions) and the quality seems very high. definitely can be dressed up or down (good for a business casual work environment).",pos
"I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress, full price, in this condition. otherwise, the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect.",pos
I love this long knit skirt! it is great for any of the cooler seasons! it has a lovely somewhat a-line look when you have it on. the knit is a light weight but has a nice feel to it. true to size. i love the length to pair with tall boots!,pos

"This dress can be flattering on any figure type - but especially for women who need a little curve. i always wear a 6 in hd, and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front. flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra. it may not be a great cut for a short person, as it has a long line to it and lots of busy-ness. only drawback, which depends on your taste, is the yellow pattern - it's a weird kind of greeny yellow",pos
"Rarely do i find tops that fit similar to the model in the picture. my body type is no comparison. i am 5'5"" and about 170# with 30"" waist. this sweater in a large fit perfectly where the back lining and ruffle fell right at the top of my bottom which was very flattering. not to short and not long over bottom. just right. bought in cream and wish i would have bought in both colors...........",pos
"This shirt totally exceeded my expectations -- the detail and colors are wonderful, and the shirt itself is quite comfortable. the shirt is a bit boxy, but there is enough structure and detail so that it looks quite flattering on. plus, it looks great with jeans or with a skirt -- it is very easy to style!",pos

i am size 6 and i ordered the medium and its flows well on me. i like it a little looser for that boho look.",pos
"I love the soft, slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order, the green version had sold out. as it turns out, the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today, but i wore it anyway!",pos
I'm about 10-15 lbs overweight and the material clings a bit. this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape.,pos

The picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like. the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color. it looks great on and the colors compliment each other. i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe.,pos
"The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful. the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color. it simply did not match. it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color. the fit was ""ok"". just didn't love it.",neg

the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit. i love the fit and make of the jumper, but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day. this is still happening after several washes, which makes me feel disappointed. it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely.",neg

"I found this top in the roc center store and knew i had to have it! when my usual size 2 was unavailable, i sized down to a 0 because it looked plenty big and it fits fine. i bought the ivory color and love it! i plan on wearing it with pants as well as skirts. it's a lovely shade of ivory, quite flattering. boxy tops are often not for me, but this one is perfect!",pos
This top is the epitome of late summer and getting into fall mood. it's soft fabric falls nicely on top of skinny jeans. the open shoulders are trendy and flattering!,pos
"I bought the white in my usual xs size, i don't agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin, because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric , not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear.",pos
"This tunic is amazing. i'm not usually one for turtlenecks but it's not too tight around the neck and very comfortable. i love the versatility, it can be worn with pants/leggings or a skirt,  you can layer it with a shirt or blouse underneath or throw a jacket over it.",pos
Love this top! very feminine and looks cute with heels and jeans or can be worn more casually too!,pos

please please offer another suit before december 2015 so i can buy for our cruise!!!",pos

but what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low, and it survived just fine!",pos
"Beautiful dress! perfect for work, the museum, a summer picnic...so chic, yet extremely comfortable. i purchased the blue/orange combo and the colors definitely pop. for reference i am 5'2, 115, and i went with the xs petite. especially reoommend for anyone with her hourglass being more full on bottom. super flattering!",pos
"This is festival dress epitomized. flowery, flowy, romantic styling. so many layers in a muted color pattern, but also retains heat since it's all polyester. good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out. my distress is regarding the length. petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges. it's still too long! if i hem, i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern.",pos
"I've been wanting to buy a romper that was easy to wear and take off and i like this one for many reasons. the elastic waist ""holds"" the romper in place when you take the top off, the top comes off easily bc it's a halter and the design is very chic and sophisticated. the only down side is the tie is really heavy if you tie it in the back. it's better to tie it in the front like the model in this picture. it is a bit long (comes down to my ankles) but looks good with heels.",pos
It's exactly how it appears in the pictures-awesome shirt,pos
"These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.

I absolutley love this sweater. is is very cozy and warm and can be paired with many different outfits. i am upset i didn't get one in every color!,pos
"This top is so lovely. the fabric is thick and soft, and the drape is phenomenal. i did size down based on reviews, i typically wear a large and the medium is perfect, nice and flowy and very flattering.",pos
I can't believe that i'm the first person to write a review. this top is so cute. i tried it on in a store and loved it. the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in. the color and print are pretty. the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami.,pos
"I love this sweater!! i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesn't look like a sack on me. plus, it is the perfect weight. i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable.",pos
I'm obsessed with this top! i got it for christmas and wore it to dinner with black pants and flats and got lots of compliments. the fit is cute and fun and the detail is about even prettier in person.,pos
I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants. i get a lot of compliments on it. i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style. the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick. the color is true to what is shown. the fit is perfect and what i expected. i highly recommend the purchase.,pos
I love this skirt!! i'm trying to find the perfect place to wear it :),pos
"I love this tee, i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered 2 of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium.",pos
Got this shirt in the green color. it's long and flowy and fits true to size. super comfy.,pos
"I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it! i am 5'1"", 97 lbs, 32b and ordered a 0 petite. fits like a glove. the dress has a slight give to it, but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size. fits close through the waist and flares out below. the length hit above the knee so not too short, although i wouldn't want it any shorter. my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back, but i had no issue. overall, the dress is stunning with",pos
I love this shirt. it is great quality and hangs perfectly! please make more colors in this one. i would buy all of them!!,pos

Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!,pos
This is a great layering piece. took it on a trip and wore with both a long sleeve and tank under it. is more 'khaki' color then the photo shows - which was a goo thing for me.,pos
"The sherpa vest i received from retailer was the color the model is wearing.. the same hue and shade of both the faux shearliing and faux leather. i'm very satisfied with the vest. i believe it runs a bit large. i usually wear a large, sometimes an extra large yet the m/l fit me fine. shearling is very in this year and this will complete your look-wearing either pants or skirts.",pos
"I really love the fit of this classic scoop neck tee. i am 5'8"", 140 lbs, and 34 a/b. i am typically a size xs/s or 2/4 in all retailer tops. however, this brand (velvet) runs small. i had to order a size medium. the fit is slim to your body and is a little sexy with the low scoop neck! the fabric is very soft and a little thin. i am a little concerned how it is going to wash, it seems a little delicate. but i will wash it on the delicate cycle and line dry it. i ordered the black (classic",pos
"This is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned -- and i am kind of a dress person. this one has beautiful detailing -- sheer sleeves, but the bodice and bottom half are lined. fits beautifully -- i am a little busty, so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open, but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed, which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress. i am 5'6"" and the length was just right, abou",pos
"I love this little chemise! the adjustable straps sold me because i'm petite. i generally wear a small/27p. i'm about 5'1"", 124 lbs. i purchased a small and it fit perfect! the fabric is nice, not too thin or too thick. i would totally wear it just as easily as a nightgown or beach coverup. i've never been able to wear scrappy dresses, but it could probably pass for one of those too. it's flattering and pretty without being too ""pretty"", if you get my meaning.",pos
I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.,pos
Beautiful top!  had trouble with the buttons but i just slipped it over my head to avoid trying to get the buttons loose.  it will look great with dark jeans and mules!,pos
"I love this top. i am always looking for tops that are comfortable and work as basics. the material is super soft and not too clingy. it feels like pajamas, but looks very polished. i am a little wide in the stomach and bust, but this didn't look boxy. i got these in all 3 colors.",pos
The tshirt is comfy and has a little curve on the tail which is fun!,pos
"I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress. i liked the pictures and decided to give it a try.
the dress turned out to be too loose (i got size 4 after checking the measurements chart, i'm 5'7' 125 lb and usually wear s). i could practically wrap myself in this dress. besides, it looks a bit too long (well, i'm not as tall as the model in the photos and i don't like wearing high heels).
the material looks faded, not as bright as in the pictures. i like distressed and vintage style, but this",neg
Size up!!! this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest. ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it.,pos

This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out.,pos
This looks so cute...but don't be fooled. it is so poofy. it does not look in real life like it does on the model. it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous. i was so disappointed.,neg
"I love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress. hooray! i ordered it in the xl, which is my usual size in their shirts. when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move. my chest also caused the dreaded ""button gape."" it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure. so disappointing!!",neg

"This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer. it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it. also, it is pretty lightweight, so it stays cool.",pos
"I love this sweater! i'm very sensitive to fabrics and this really doesn't bother me too much. it's soft, but just a tiny bit scratchy. but the color is a rich purple and the flexibility of being able to wear it draped or not is a nice touch. it comes right at waist length....little on the short side if you want to hide your muffin top, but otherwise a winner all around.",pos
"Love it ! ...although i had to purchase it in 3 sizes before finding the right one. it does run large. i normally take a l or el ... but a medium in this had the perfect drape ! i am 5'11"" and 185 lbs and it is very flattering ! a perfect piece to be worn as a dress or as a tunic over skinny pants ... can be as sophisticated or casual as you choose to make it with accessories !",pos
"I'd been eyeing this dress for a while, wondering if it could work for me. i wound up ordering the sp size when it went on sale. its pretty perfect-i am 5'4' and currently 130 lbs. it fits well, if a touch loose in the waist, but i think if i had purchased the xsp it might be too snug through the bust, as it's fairly fitted there. the neckline comes a little lower than i usually wear, which is part of why i wanted to order the petite size rather than the regular (that and the length), but i can",pos
"There were no reviews, it's an ""online exclusive"" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth",neg

"I bought these in light grey and navy. they are both beautiful. high quality,very flattering, and so comfortable! i love them! they're a perfect long length. i have long legs and it can be challenging finding a good length in pants. the pockets are deep and functional, which is rare in women's pants. they are more than i like to spend, but i will get a lot of wear out of them. they look and feel fantastic. i highly recommend these!",pos

the embroidery does catch on the beading so you have to handle it carefully. it's worth the special treatment, though!",pos
"I saw this and the ""giddy up"" tees at the store, and it was so difficult to decide because they have their own uniqueness. unlike the giddy up tee, this tee has no embroidery, but saying it has just patterns is underestimating it. the pattern is a work of art, it has cowboys, ranch scenery, cacti, and the earthly colors are gorgeous for all seasons (especially for those who still have a leftover summer tan). the hem of the tee is a bit round which i thought is unique and versatile for tucking in",pos
"I just received this dress and i love it. after reading the reviews i was worried that it would be too tight so i ordered both a 6 and an 8. i am 5'8"", hourglass, 135 lbs, and the 6 is just perfect. i love how it falls just below the knee, but the front slit gives it that little flirt factor. this is the go-to summer dress i had been looking for!",pos
"These feel well made and so soft, but for me, they were just too low and too baggy...all i did was pull them up and feel uncomfortable. i wanted them to work! maybe in a smaller size they would feel better. i ordered my normal 25, in the light pink. they were very cute, i think i just have a hard time with pants with a rise this low.",pos
Very cute and flattering. very fitting in legs and thighs and i have fairly slim legs. i am a size 6 and 6 was very snug. i recommend trying these on in store or trying several sizes to see best fit.,pos
This jacket is so pretty and fits amazing! i ordered the size small and it fits as expected. i normally wear a size small and a size 4.,pos

"Loved the one i had in white so much i ordered the green - such a beautiful piece! size seems true to size, and it elevates anything you wear it with; skirt, jeans, shorts....if you are on the fence, jump- you won't be disappointed.",pos
These pants are very soft and comfortable.  great for lounging around the house and for sleeping.,pos

it is kind of a weird design, but intriguing. i received it in the mail yesterday, i am 5'6"", 125 lbs and have hips. as a previous reviewer mentioned, this dress is more fitted than a swing dress as it appears. fortunately the xs fit me just right - but i cannot gain another lb.

my husband said that i looked like i was in a choir because of the higher neck design and bell sleeves, but he too found the dress somewhat alluring.",pos
"Love this cozy sweater for layering. i purchased the green, have the cream saved in my cart, and also love the coral and blue too. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, ordered size small which was perfect",pos
The weight and drape of this shirt is wonderful. it is very comfortable while still being flattering. you could wear it with jeans and sneakers or heels. fits true to size and the navy color is very deep.,pos
"Soft fabric, waistband is flat no vpl!lace trim cuts in a bit for a little vpl- but still nice lightweight, barely there but full coverage. would buy again!",pos
Couldn't resist the polka dots! very cute and stylish cardi. since i'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me. i tried on the xs and small and while there wasn't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room. it's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase!,pos
"Color (orange/red) and fabric nice and good quality
i ordered this since i live in astoria but am glad i did.",pos
I really liked this cardigan. it is well made and very pretty. i will wear it when it gets a little cooler in early fall because i tried to wear it on one of these really hot days and it felt little too warm.,pos

"Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price, but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.",pos
I purchased this in black. as in the other reviews the lace detail is a little snug in the arms but it did stretch. i did not have a problem with any fraying or quality issues. the shape is very flattering. i've been asked where i bought this several times.,pos
Ordered a few things for a last minute decision on what to wear to a wedding - i slipped this on right out of the box and decision was made! tunic style is great for all body types and hides any bulges. crochet neckline and sleeves are cute and a little sexy. dress is very comfortable and not too short. wore this with pearls and ankle-strap pumps for a dressier look. very happy with this one!,pos
I love this tee so much i bought in every color available. i have received so many compliments on each one! so soft and comfortable and easy care.,pos

"This skirt is stunning. like the other reviewer, i believe this is probably the most beautiful thing in my closet. the colors are just striking. it is also flattering - i find some skirts can kind of pouf out around the hips and add bulk, this one lays nice and flat and looks great. the material is very soft and simple and i love the frayed edges at the bottom. i am just between 5""3"" and 5'4"" and weigh 112 lbs; i took an xs and it fits perfectly, so it seems true to size. only thing, if you are",pos
I love these. i'm between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.,pos

"I absolutely love this dress! the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape. it's great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south, but i can put tights with it when it gets colder. the dress is thin, but not sheer so there's no need for a liner. i'm 5'8, weigh 144lbs and ordered this dress in a size 10. i think i might have been able to wear an 8, but the 10 fit so well that i kept it.",pos

"According to the label, this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned. i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label, and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered. it looks like there's a drawstring running through every seam. so disappointed in the quality and the labeling. awful! i gave it one extra star because it's cute.",neg

Cool cut and texture a winner,pos
I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,pos
This is great and very soft inside. i am wearing it around my house all the time. great over workout clothes or jeans and leggings.,pos

"I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress. maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered, but i still don't think it would have worked. the fabric is very soft but that's where it's qualities, for me, ended. the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips.

"I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did, there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot, the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem, since the shirt can be tucked but i will have",pos

This blouse is flattering and fits great. i also have the other color in cream with the floral design. very nice!,pos

"I used to be a solid ""2"" then had to move down to 0 and 00... #i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs#, in this definitely a 2. the tighter part in the fitted waist is why i recommend peiople sizing ""up"" #if you are between sizes, choose bigger, teh cutis so flattering, it wont matter#.

My experience with these have been great and the colors are even more beautiful in person! they're easy to dress up for work and going out and easy to dress down for hanging out on the weekends. i am typically a size 31-32 and 30's fit me like a glove. i also typically wear petite but don't like the just-above-the-ankle cut of these so i purchased them in regular and wear them as pants. i can un-cuff them with heals/wedges or keep the double cuff and they hit me perfectly as full-length pants wi,pos
"Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my 15 year old daughter. purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it! she wore today with suede booties-very soft, cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens. she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall.",pos
This top is super versatile--i wear it with jeans on the weekend but it's also work appropriate. it's light and perfect for warm weather!,pos
It's a beautiful skirt. the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering.,pos
"When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.",neg
"I feel that for this price, i should love this top (and i wanted to). however, the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top, and there were a few things about it that could be improved.
pros: i ordered a medium and feel that it's pretty true to size. additionally, the fabric is nice and light (but also *sheer*) and, generally speaking, has a nice pattern. overall, it's a very pretty top.
cons: there's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly",neg
"I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.",pos
I'm super happy with the way these jeans fit. i typically buy ag jeans for fit and quality. this pair is extremely comfy with the right amount of stretch yet still somewhat relaxed. they do run a big large so i sized down and they still fit great... lots of compliments!,pos
"This dress is beautiful and surprisingly flattering. i never would've picked this up for myself, but i'm so glad i did. it's also super comfortable.",pos
"This skirt is great for the office, but also stylish enough to wear out to drinks/dinner afterwards. i think it fits a little big - i'm usually s and i ended up with an xs.

i think the tan is a little cuter than the gray in person, so i would recommend this one.",pos
I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as i'm not big busted,pos
"I am quite happy with this dress! i was wondering what the colors would look like in person, and i'm happy to report that the skirt is a nice mellow orange-coral. beautiful detail in the patterns used here, and i always like a dress that has great color-play close up and far away. for reference, i am a size 16, full figured, with a 40 c bust, and the size 16 was just right for me. sometimes with maeve dresses you can size down, but there is no stretch to the dress, or the slip, so that is someth",pos
I tried this dress on today and ended up buying it. its a thicker material and looks better in person. more red and white striped with an uneven hem. the back of the dress is a bit more like a swim suit. i probably is best for smaller chests. i'm guessing it runs a little bit big - as the medium fit nicely on me and lately i'm a large medium/small large.,pos
"Great top. i ordered online because i needed a white top that i could get away with wearing in fall to work (even though it's white). i'm ""busty"" and normally shirts like this make me look gigantic (like i'm going to tip over) but this was a very flattering cut and fit. i highly recommend. it was also comfortable and i wore it with blue slacks to work (the flower is partially dark blue). i'm 5'8"" and the length was perfect. not too long in the butt but enough to cover it subtly.",pos
I bought the xs in green and every time i wear it i get compliments all day. it's a more youthful style than i usually wear but i couldn't resist the dark green color. i wear this with black leggings and flats and it's a perfect dress for a school day.,pos
"I bought this impulsively to wear to a wedding, and i&#39;m so glad i did. it is so soft and comfy and gorgeous--and has pockets. it&#39;s loose but really really flattering somehow. i would typically get a size 12 in a fitted dress but the medium was perfect for me.",pos
"This shirt is perfect! bought charcoal and ivory. compliments galore, super cute with jeans, workout pants. love it!",pos
"I love this dress! i would definitely accessorize with a belt. my body type fits best in this style of dress because i don't have a big bust size, if you do i would try it on first. for being shorter, 5'3"", i love the length.",pos
This top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers. so many nice details and a great fit!,pos
Love these shorts. such a pretty print!,pos
"I had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it. i love all things bows, but usually they are off-centered over the left shoulder. i have a bit of an ocd thing, and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them, i can't wear them. i love that this bow is in the middle-and i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath. it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look. i feel",pos
"I ordered this coat in the ""pink"" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets, for anyone who remembers them)

one concern: since the wool is light",pos
"I bought this top on sale in the store and immediately came home and ordered it in another color online. i love the length even in the xs which isn't always the case. i am 5'9"" and a size 2 and the xs fits me perfect even after washing and drying a couple times. looks cute under sweaters and vests. can wear all year round. lightweight and good neckline.",pos
"Love this top! it is almost universally flattering, and washes beautifully. it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings, but soooo much better! if you are on the fence on this one, i highly recommend you give it a try.",pos
"This top has the thickness and comfort of a sweatshirt, with artistic flair and a figure flattering, unique cut. it works very well on me as i'm a petite large. i only wish it was a little roomier, or that i was 10 lbs lighter, but it's stretchy and i really love wearing it. the color is a rich indigo with a slightly worn look which adds texture and dimension.",pos
"Great fit, looks excellent with jeans as well as tucked in with a pencil skirt.",pos
"I purchased this blazer in both striped versions for work. it's basically a blazer/sweatshirt hybrid!

while it does run true to size, i can wear a small or medium in retailer; i purchased medium in this. don't size down if your size is ambiguous!",pos
"I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length. i don't know if the length stated is from a size m, but the small was definitely shorter (in the front at least).  if you're petite with curves like me, it's not a flattering cut.",neg
I bought this in store on sale and absolutely love it.,pos
"Purchased these in both colors today. (great sale price.)
hei hei is my favorite brand of pants, especially their pull on prints.
i am always a medium, these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach. i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in each.
the beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up. the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous. they have a lovely silky feel to them. i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness won't bother me. being on",pos
"I wanted to love these jeans, but as a woman who is almost 45 there was way too much stretch in them. i am always a size 26 and i couldn't wear these, they were way too tight! they went back the next day. i will say, it could be my body type, i""m a runner so my legs are muscular. if you have very thin legs, these could be great and work for you. i loved the color, dark blue.",neg
These are my favorite pants. i love the fit and they are comfortable. i have them in several colors. i hope you never discontinue them!,pos
"Great fit, can be dressy or casual, goes with everything, i adore tis jacket!",pos
"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p",pos
I really like this dress. it does not bother me that it is not lined. i feel very feminine wearing it. i plan to get a shrug to wear with it.,pos
"I wanted to love this. however, the fit was funky and the colors were muted. this is definitely something you must try on in the store. too risky to buy online due to weird fit.",neg
"I really love this rose-pink color. the pants fit like a glove. the cuff is not sewn up, so you can lower the cuff to where you like it.",pos
"Love this vest! saw it and bought it instantly. i'm 5'8"" and slim and got the xs. it fits perfectly. there is a lot of ""puff"" to it, but it's really warm and soft.",pos
"Spotted this in the local store last week & just had to try it on! it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way. my usual size small was too big. the oversized look was fine from front & back view, but in the side view the bottom stuck way out. the xs was much better so i took it home. its very comfy & looks great with dark blue denim. 5'3"", 118#.",pos
I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and duster........love it!,pos
These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.,neg

"This beautiful dress is the perfect style for fall. when i first picked this up, i was surprised by how heavy it felt. there is so much embroidery i thought the dress was lined with another layer. however, the fabric is not stiff. there are numerous exquisite details including a button up bodice, additional embroidery on the skirt and ladder lace on the sleeves. 


i sized up to l because of my heavy back/shoulders/upper arms. sizing up does make the bodice of the dress look a tad wider but n",pos
Bought this top for date night -- something a little special. it's that and also very comfortable. i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates. easy to dress up or down -- perfect!,pos
This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and can't be saved. the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesn't lay right underneath. the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse. i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print. definitely not worth the money even at 1/2 off plus 25-%.,neg
"I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur",neg
"I love the style and look oft this blouse but the fit is a bit off for me. i'm usually either a l or xl. i don't think it came in an xl so i decided to give the l a shot. i would say it runs roomy except through the arms. i found the arms to run strangely tight...and it's not an area i usually have a problem with. the body skimmed nicely over my trouble spots (middle). i found the neckline very flattering and it laid nicely over by dd bust. the v is deep but you don't feel overexposed.

I absolutely love this top! i bought it in white and ended up buying it in the lavender as well. the top is very flattering and works with any occasion. the fabric is a little thin but its fine with a nude bra. i have worn the top to work and out at night and i always get lots of compliments!,pos
"I was thinking this would be a straight up terry cloth athleisure top, but the subtle metallic thread woven into the cloud gray fabric elevates the style. really loved the top because of the cut and interesting hemline, but i adore it for the bit of sparkle.",pos
"I was fortunate to order the perfect size the first time. i am 5'3"" and 125 and ordered the size 4. it is a great fit. these lightweight pants are super cute and i especially love the way they are cut to dip a bit lower (not asymmetrical, just talking about the drape) on the inside hem so outside hem is perky and the bottom looks wide and is flattering. these zip up the back and the back lays flat which is also flattering. i love the look of the fabric so if i have a complaint it's that for the",pos
I love this jacket! it is stylish and is ideal for a casual night out,pos
"Ref: 5'4"", 125# 27/4, 32g. i don't think this is for us shorter women. this hits you right where you don't want a vertical line to hit. it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are. the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldn't even dream of making this work. i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me! glad i tried in-store and didn't online order.",neg
"I've been anticipating the arrival of these pants and was literally at the doorstep with ups. i have a birthday celebration visiting wineries and thought this would be the perfect outfit.it did not disappoint. fits like a glove....very flattering and comfy! i am 5""4 and ordered a small petite. not too short, but still have the option of wearing sandals. i hesitated because of the price - but so worth it!!",pos
"This coat is fun, flirty, & flattering. i bought it strictly for how good it looks on - it's not a coat for warmth. the top is tailored and fitted, but the bottom is very full and swings. (there is a lot of fabric on the bottom). i'm not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves - i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me. however, i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it, so keep that in mind. the small fit me perfect. v",pos
"This is a beautiful quality knit. i do wish that it was a tad bit longer...i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and found it to hit like the model shot. since the sweater flares a little at the bottom, i think it might be more flattering a little longer. keeping this regardless because it will still get plenty of wear.",pos
"I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors. it is so comfortable and very flattering. i am 5'11"", so many tunics are more like shirts on me, but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants. the v neck is a nice, feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges.",pos
"Cute, easy to wear. perfect little top! will go with so many things. the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch. i'm a solid 8 with a pretty large chest. i think i need to go up. not sure. about to order a 10 to see if there is a big difference. so, if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes.",pos
"I loved the fit and design so much that i splurged and purchased all three! the lavender has a blue tinge to it that makes it really unique. the coral is a little on the neon side but i love that and it's a great color for summer. i'm waiting for the white to arrive and hope it's actually white and not ivory, as retailer colors are sometime a little off. i'm petite and order the xxsp which fits like a dream. not too tight or loose, super comfortable and flattering. easy to pair with white, khaki,",pos

Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large.,pos
Charming dress! fit perfectly with great movement through back and chest area. flattering length(s) with just the right amount of fabric. inside dress sheath or slip dress. zips to waist for fit. i am smitten with the dress - just love it!,pos
The sweater is as cute in person as it is online.,pos
"I am totally in love with this sweater!! it is lightweight, comfortable, and very versatile. throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual. throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy. the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear. the color is not a light red, but rather a rich cabernet wine color. this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites!!",pos
"I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute, feminine details.",neg
"Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it's cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you.",neg
"Appears much more sleek in the photograph. in real life, this shirt looks more like a pajama top. thin, extremely casual, not worth the price i paid- even in black. will be exchanging it tomorrow.",neg
Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and that's where it ends. cheap flimsy polyester and no lining. far too expensive for what it is. on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great. i would say it runs a tad big but in my case ( i have wide shoulders) not big enough to downsize. too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress.,neg
I love the color and style of this dress. and i wanted to love it too? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress. checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure.,neg

"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black, and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it, but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer, so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it, which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine, but now i will be looking for i",pos

"But i have no idea where i would wear this dress... i tried on the size 2 in store, someone had returned it, but i always loved the cut and color of this dress (been in my wish list) so i tried it on anyway. it is so lovely, the cut is super flattering, the bow on the chest is beautiful, and the colors are much nicer in person, pinker. the feel is a bit satin0like, soft. i would need the 0 as it was a bit wide on the chest, but not a petite - surprisingly (usually do need petite in dresses).

I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.,neg

"This skirt is great! the fabric is so soft and light. i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldn't be too transparent, and it wasn't. the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice. the color is exactly as shown. i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up... i shouldn't have! the skirt was too big in the waist and too long. so i exchanged and the fit was right on. i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist, so keep that in mind. the only t",pos

"Was very surprised when i opened the package, this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through. the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all. i have a short waist length so it should have worked. the color is a little darker than pictured, but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced. going back asap.",neg
Beautiful top... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school. it's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it's beautiful. definitely worth getting!,pos
"Absolutely love this little shift!!! i bought it on a whim really. it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the 80's! crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar :-) this is not that sort of velvet. it's also not some cheap polyester looking knock-off of true velvet. i always find those to have a somewhat ""plastic"" sheen to them. that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur",pos

"I'm very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy. it it absolutely adorable, and the classic plaid is timeless. as first reviewer said, the styling of this on the model does it no favors. it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering, forgiving way. the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section, then flares out on the bottom section. that bottom flare can sometimes add inches/pounds but this top does it in a very modern, subtle and flattering fashion. and the mater",pos

I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.,neg
"This shirt is amazing. it's soft, comfortable. i can't speak yet as to how well it will hold up but i plan on wearing it a lot. the cut is great, the shirt flutters away from under the empire waist line and the nylon patch in the back, creating a flattering shape without clinging anywhere. the sleeves are nice, long, and fitted.

this shirt will work great as a winter/fall basic piece but the texture, color, and contrast detail in the back make it interesting on its own. very versatile.

This is going to be a favorite. the fabric is substantial without being heavy. it has a beautiful drape. this blouse is loose but skims the body closer rather than being blousy. it works perfectly worn with a skirt or pants and belted or tucked but is not too blousy if left unbelted. i purchased the black with the lovely feather pattern. the colors are vibrant. i'm always looking for something black with some color because i tend to wear a lot of black on the bottom. this fit true to size. i am,pos

This garment has the most beautiful and detailed embroidery on the front and across the top of the back. i purchased this blouse in pale pink in a xs for my daughter-in-law who is an retailer fanatic. i am sure she will look stunning in it. my only negative would be the silver accent thread across the front is overkill.,pos

"I adore a well made and well fit tshirt. t.la always delivers! this one is no exception. fun, swingy and light. the tie on back is a fun little addition and the length is perfect. i'm 5'9 and always prefer longer tops. the swing in this one gives it a great length. love the colors but decided to stick with basic white. i'd love this in black too! highly recommend!",pos
"Absolutely beautiful dress. i bought a size 8 and found it tts. i typically buy 6/8 in retailer dresses. the print is gorgeous (i am a sucker for anything with poppies) and i love the silky material; hugs your curves and flows nicely. i was worried the torso would be too long based on prior reviews, and because i am of short torso, but it fits well. would definitely recommend.",pos
"I was desperate to find a dress for an upcoming wedding. i basically tired on every dress in the store. this one was by far the best dress i tried on. the outer layer is delicate, and has great stitching and embroidery. the only problem is that the slip is skin tight and too small. this dress is so awesome i'm willing to overlook that and find my own slip. when i came out of the dressing room another couple stopped to tell me how amazing the dress looked. this dress is beautiful!",pos

"I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months, or layer it with a sweater, thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style), but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4, which fit me perfectly. it's nice that",pos

These are literally the most comfortable and the softest jeans i have ever owned. i just got them a few weeks ago and i'm already obsessed with them. they have the perfect amount of stretch that makes them flattering and comfortable but they don't stretch out like all my other jeans do. i ordered my usual size 28 and they fit great! can't recommend these enough!,pos
I bought this when it first came back a number of years ago and loved it because it is great for travel! it actually can be kind of a blanket when you are on airplanes that tend to be cold and it is so hard now to get a blanket. it is also great coat for me as i live in southern california and it is not too heavy but does help the evening chill. i went on a trip with this a few months after i originally bought it and i accidentally lef at the hotel i was staying at. i am so glad it is back so th,pos

"When i saw this skirt on line, i wasn't impressed--especially at the price. but then i saw it in the store and i had to have it! it's beautiful. definitely a colder weather skirt due to the nice weight of the fabric. the colors are lovely and subtle, with a little sheen, ensuring you can wear it with many tops and for many occasions, from everyday to dressier. length is just at the bottom of the knee for me (5'7""), with a flattering and comfortable cut.",pos

I love love this top.  it is so pretty!  i am stopped by strangers complimenting me on it. it is so flattering.  i wear a cami under it and find it perfect!  it hits at the perfect length below the waist on my jeans.  it's easy to throw on and go.  casual but dressy.  the sleeves do bell out so you may need to watch them when you eat.  i've accidentally caught them on my plate.  the shirts washes well.,pos
"I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!",pos

I love this tank to wear alone because it is soft and more lovely than a basic plain tank. it is especially great to layer with a sweater/ cardigan. the colors are always fabulous and the design is wonderfully feminine. i own several and love them all. it's a great value especially on sale. i normally wear a size 6 and the small fits perfectly.,pos

"This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly, the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the 4 i ordered looked baggy, so i went into the store to try a 2, but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6"" 113lbs), so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though, the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing, it's perfect.",pos
"This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem",pos
This top is super flattering and comfortable. perfect summer wear!,pos
"With all of the glowing reviews of this dress, i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress. it fit nicely, the quality was great, but there is a decorative (?) line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement. i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time, kept glancing down to make sure i hadn't come undressed. i suppose i could've gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut, but decided to take it back. i didn't see tha",neg

"This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable, machine washable.  an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl.",pos
"This is a beautiful sweater, warm, looks great with jeans as well as more formal work clothes. the neckline gives it a stylish boho twist beyond the traditional. i love the color, and it can function almost like a neutral, complimenting almost any other hues. highly recommended!",pos
This jacket is perfect. swings just the right amount without looking too big.,pos
"Love this shirt. the print is a little loud, but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however, that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty, if that helps. the red is short-sleeved, by the way if ordered online, cute and flattering.",pos
"I ordered both the green and the pink and needed the extra extra small petite in the shirt to make it work for me 
 nice light material cute fit 
 unfortunately didn't like the pink color was too bright for me  ( and although i ordered an extra extra small petite they sent me an extra small petite which is just slightly too big )and saw the mango in the store which i also didn't like the color",pos
"I really wanted to like this dress, but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back. will be returning.",neg
"Amazing color- true to picture. it runs a bit large, even with layering underneath. i'm usually a 10/12 / l / 34d in tops and i needed the medium for a nice fit. i'm long-ish in the torso, and this sweater fits just slightly cropped, so really perfect with a longer button down underneath. the buttons on the back are a nice detail.",pos
They make your butt look great! very whimsical design.,pos
This shirt is so comfortable and flattering. the quality is really good but i would definitely size down. it's not too heavy and can be worn with skinny jeans/jeggings..,pos
"The color is more like bluish-green, very elegant! it's very soft and feels great on skin. i love the buttons on the back, it's such a great touch and brings this sweater to a whole new level. 
i usually wear xs but because i'm going to wear this sweater with a button up shirt underneath, i ordered s. great investment! love to have it in my closet.",pos
"I thought that this dress would be perfect for my 60th birthday, however i was disappointed when i received it. it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person. it did nothing for me. also, it runs small and was tight.",neg
"I bought this dress for a couple fall weddings to hide my postpartum belly. it was only available in a size 8 -- which is my typical size. i was nervous based on the reviews it would still be too big, but it fits perfectly. i am 5'10"", so i assume my frame can handle the drappiness well!",pos
"I've admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room, much to my delight! i'm generally a sale shopper, so this doesn't mean i didn't think it was priced well. i have the oatmeal top with yellow/gold/orange pattern on the skirt in xs. the small fits comfortably up top, but on my petite frame, the top just looked too big, so i went with xs. i suppose the straps are a bit confusing, but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin",pos
I bought this b/c it looked exactly my style and i was right! i've worn this once and it is so comfortable and the fit is great. i can see this being a shirt i wear again and again all summer. i bought the black and am thinking about buying the peachy-plaid color...,pos
"This dress is so beautiful in person. it is not overly flowy, well made and extremely feminine. i really have not a bad word to say about it. and on sale, it's a steal. i plan to wear mine with tall boots as shown and with my cowboy boots.",pos
I loved this top even more in person! it is made well and beatiful! the sheer under layer adds a sexyness to the design. the back of the shirt is open. i really like this detail!,pos
The jeans are flatering and stylish. they are slightly distressed but will go with anything. the fit is like other pilcro stet pants i've purchased and loved.,pos
"I was hesitant to try this duster vest because i'm on the shorter side (5'1 110). i was very pleasantly surprised when i tried it on and love it! i ordered a xs petite and yes it is long (as it is supposed to be), but fitted enough that it looks very cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. the fleece lining was substantial and the outer wool was very soft. definitely a keeper!",pos
"I'm taking this to hawaii for the holidays, i'm wearing it with black calf length tights and a black belt. it is fine without tights, i just like that look. it is a really great dress.",pos
Awesome shirt...great transition into fall. somewhat sheer. extremely comfortable!,pos
"This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design, lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large, but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.",pos
This shirt runs gigantic and it's not even cute. i.'m done buying retailer online.,neg
Just like in picture! super cute and comfortable sweater!,pos
"I love my very old pilcro stet jeans. they are the perfect denim weight, and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush. not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately. the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs. and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide. it's a bummer.",neg
"I loved this top so much, i ended up buying both of the designs. they are so cute and eye catching, and the layered look is really fun. it fit me very well.",pos
"I saw this top online and ordered immediately!
i loved the color, lace, and unique details.
sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!
the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly, and is very rough against your skin.
the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way.,.....

"I purchased this about a month ago and its a great piece! it goes with just about everything from dresses to jeans and a long sleeve t-shirt. i love how it drapes around the front, and the material is very soft. it's a great piece for fall weather that will be a keeper in my closet!",pos
"This velvet maxi dress is what fall dreams are made of. it fits very true to size and is the perfect length, about to ankles. the material is soft and had so much subtle details in it... gorgeous! once the weather cools a bit it will also pair nicely with tall boots, and an undershirt. i plan on rocking this all fall and winter!",pos
"I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys, the 27 fits very comfortably. 

i""m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.",pos
A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 34 dd  and 145 pounds and 5'4 height.,pos
"I love this faux-fur coat. i wear it both dressed up & down. i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long & i'm happy i did (5'4"" 103 for reference). the faux is soft & comfy. it's warm, but not blizzard warm. i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it & ""where did you get that?""
definitely worth the purchase on sale.",pos
"I love this top!! fits perfectly, and not too long. i'm 5'4"", 112 lbs and a 32dd and the small fits like a gem.not too fitted, but not boxy. i like that it covers my waist, but isn't too long, either. i may order another one i love it so much!",pos
"On me, thsi was ginormous, looked like a mu mu. it is pretty, but there was just too much fabric, even in the smallest size. the quality seems nice, and it looks pretty, but overwhelming. i will say, i think it would work on tail lean people, i have pretty muscular shoulders, so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look 30 pounds heavier, no joke. fabric is soft though. give it a try, just not for me...

"So, i bought these pants in mid-september while at a local retailer store - i thought they were a bit short but the salesgirl assured me they were fine. wore them soon after and then discovered they came in tall sizes as well. anyway, one they came on sale i rebought them nabbing the last tall in my size. while that is a testament for how much i love them - the fit is true to size other than the length issue. i am 5'10"" with long legs - the 28t fit me perfectly. of course they cost me more than th",pos
"I tried on a dressing room full of items before christmas, and this was the clear winner. i got it in the green xs, which fit perfectly. i am 5'6"" and of medium build. the s was slightly too big through the chest and arms - skewed a little too military looking for me. i like the versatility of leaving it open or zipping it up, but like another reviewer, i wish the top lapel would snap back onto the shoulder because it can flop back and that gets a little annoying. overall, i really like the fitt",pos
"Really like this top. fun flair, nice quality shirt. great for dressing up with skirt and also would be perfect with boots for the rodeo. i paired it with a skirt and boots for church. wore white cami under to emphasize lace details. super cute. tried 8 and 8p. thought petite was too short in length on me (5'4""). will send petite back.",pos
I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.,pos
"This dress is very sweet and summery. i disagree with all the other reviewers who complain about their not being enough room in the chest. i wear a double d and i didn't notice any pulling, which is definitely a problem i've experienced in other button down dresses. i also appreciated that the straps were wide enough to cover a bra - though i definitely will have to have them shortened. the color is not particularly vibrant (kind of a soft yellow thoat might not be flattering on every skin tone)",pos
These are true to size and photo. i wore them to the opera and cant wait to wear them with sandals and a tee this summer!,pos
"Love this dress! perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit (not too long, not too short). i got so many compliments with this dress!",pos
The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.,neg
"This is truly a lovely dress. the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress. the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figure.
in my opinion if fits true to size, i'm 32b, 5' and 103lbs and i got it in a 2p which is the size i normally get in dresses. it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being",pos
"This is a great top and got compliments already...it does have a longer sleeve like the picture, but
really not bad. it's so comfortable and color is fabulous. great with any scarf too.",pos
"I am 5'9"" and 138 pounds slender, but with a tummy. the small fit great ,and i agree with the other reviewer that the elastic waist band is complimentary. the dress flounces out a little, but in a cute way, and it's not too short compared to so many other baby doll dresses out there now. i didn't think it looked that great on the hanger, but when i tried it on it looked so much better than i expected. got the brown. thank you to the other reviewers for the bootie, boot, moto jacket transition to",pos
"This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try. i am so glad i did. the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow. i love it and bought it right away. you better get it before it's gone. also it is true to size, i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one.",pos
"I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering, lightweight, and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable.",pos
"I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large, but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style, it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly, plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of ""cozying up"" in colder weather by wrappi",pos
I found this in my local atl store that carries petites before seeing it on-line. the materials is lovely and silky with a full lining. the top lace detailing is a nice touch and will make the dress stand out under jackets or sweaters for cool weather. this is great with any shoe type. very versatile year round piece alone or under layers. should be good for all body types.,pos
This top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect. the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking. i can't wait to wear it. it will look great with skinny jeans.,pos
Thicker than you think...the colors are gorgeous and remind you of the changing of the seasons. can not wait to wear when the weather gets cooler. retailer did not disappoint. plan to purchase in other color soon.,pos
"If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans, leggings, sandals, boots, and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!",pos
I absolutely love this product! it is so versatile and i can wear it up or dress it down. absolutely perfect paired with leggings to sit in classes all day :),pos
Very flattering cut. only con is that is seems to snag easily. extremely comfortable and don;t need to wear a cami under it like i originally thought i would.,pos
"Just bought these today and they are super soft and beautiful. also, 100% cotton (yay! i hate poly)! thought i should mention though that they do shrink in the dryer. so unless you're skinny, you might want to buy a size up or hang them to dry and then put in the dryer on low to fluff.",pos
Great top!! can be dressed up or down. the lace is great quality and i love the border detailing. i found this shirt to run pretty true to size.,pos
"I love this shirt - it is very soft, and has a nice cut and drape. fits true to size. wish there were more colors!",pos
Love this shirt! so comfortable and the style is really flattering.,pos
"This top is really a great, and it's very affordable. the fabric is light weight, but opaque enough that you don't need a cami. even though this has long sleeves, i can imagine wearing this well into the summer (and i live in south florida). it's comfortable, and the band at the bottom is not tight. the color is slightly ivory and the floral print is clear and bright. the neck tie is really nice and adds a '70's vibe without being overdone or overly dramatic. definite keeper.",pos
This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal. it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out. i was very sad to return it :( i am a size 8 with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium,neg

"I have shirts and dresses from this brand, and they are great. i was happy to finally see a pair of pants! these are just as soft and well made as the other items. i would recommend you try them on. there is only a slight variation from one size to the next, so it will depend on what look you are going for. they are cropped at the calf, but can be ""pulled up"" for a more dressier look. i cannot say enough about the material. it is so soft and comfortable. they do wonders for your behind- i think",pos

"So cute! rompers are hard because they are so cute but rarely work for all body types. this one is so super cute. the material is so soft and comfy, feels silky. i got a small and fits perfect. i'm 5'4"" and 117lbs so it runs very true to size when most clothes from retailer run big. i love rompers but only have one other one. this is by far my favorite! i can't wait until it's much warmer and i can wear it all the time.",pos
This is my first pair of ag and i love them so far. they are not cuffed as shown in the picture. they are long so i had to get them altered (i'm 5''5). the color is a rich blue and they have a nice stretch. i haven't worn them all day yet to see if they keep their shape. usually a 28 or 29 and went with the 28 on these. got them on 20 perc off sale so very happy!,pos

"This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too ""out-there"" (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely.",pos
"I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky, i love the back, how it ties, and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go, just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work...

"This is the perfect tank. it's super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!",pos

"Saw this top on-line and thought i would give it a try. i am glad i did. there is not a thing wrong with this top. cute design, nice weight fabric,(no cami needed underneath) and it fits very well. for reference i am 5' 1"", 120lbs. and 35c. and of course it goes with literally every piece of clothing you would wear on the bottom half of your body!
this is a keeper.",pos
Flowy boho tank. great details. good fabric. wear under a long cardigan or with a pair of denim cut offs and a necklace. oversized fit. i would size down one size.,pos
"Note the sleeves on the model. that is how your regular size will fit your arms. however, even if you have skinny arms like i do, the sleeves will be tight. i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only 5 ft 2 in.
i advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested. the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon.",neg
Lovely small whale cords. they fit too tight around the waist for me. unfortunately i will have to return.,pos
"This dress was one of those incidental finds i saw in-store while making an online return. for whatever reason i didn't notice this one online but loved it in person. the fit is easy going and flattering, i took a small as the shoulder fit would've been a little tight in the xs. great dress for transitioning seasons :)",pos
This jacket is gorgeous! the design is visually very interesting. the fabric is light enough that i can wear it to work and keep it on all day.,pos
"Okay, so i have an upcoming day of travel with four kids, a husband on crutches, and a flight leaving at 6am for which i have to leave my house at 4am, followed immediately by a le cirque show upon our arrival. i've been looking for something to wear during this chaos and this is it. the fabric is dreamy-soft, and the drape, perfect. yes, it looks like a dress, but i am happy for the conservative pants/jumpsuit it actually is. the pockets hold my phone without sagging, and i can wear sneakers du",pos
"Not only was it love at first sight when i saw it online, but i fell even more in love at first touch! everything about this dress is perfection. i got the black motif & the colors are just lovely. the weight & feel of the dress are nice, & the length is great. i added a skinny black belt for more waist definition, but it's cute with or without it. i am more than pleased with this purchase.",pos
"These pants fit comfortably and are really nice on! they're not too bulky and can be worn in a casual way and/or with a formal look. i just wish black jeans didn't always have that odd rubber smell. other than that, these are great!",pos
"This blouse is gorgeous, i purchased in two colors and absolutely love it. just a side note i normally wear a size small blouse or size 4-6 blouse, in this i went up a size and purchased the medium.",pos
"I finally ordered this after looking at it many times, had to order the 00p as they were out of all other petite sizes, and to my surprise, it totally fits me! why i put larger. both colors are equally nice, but due to my pale skin (and only petite available) i ordered the ""yellow"" one (brighter colors). cut is flattering, love the pleat detail in the skirt, the 00p fit my 30dd chest, and 26.5 inch waist. the length is perfect, above the knee in front and lower in the back. good choice...",pos
"I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.",neg
I ordered the orange plaid version in size 16. it fit me like it does the model. it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. the plaid isn't see-through so no extra layer of a tank is needed. the neckline isn't too low. very well-made and a great choice for summer!,pos
Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it's a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.,pos
It was purchased as a gift but truly amazing! the quality is fantastic and the owner of the sweater is truly happy with it!,pos
Agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape. unflattering overall. i normally wear a size 2 of 4 and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare. unlined and it itches!,neg
"I was originally looking for a denim skirt with a fit and flare shape. i then saw this skirt and decided it was much more versatile than denim. it is a mid weight skirt, lined, good length...just above the knee, and the swingy shape is perfect. i will wear it now with boots and a chunky sweater. when it warms up, flats and a short sleeve sweater will be cute! i ordered a small, but i really should have paid more attention to the other reviews because it does run large! i ordered another one in e",pos
I wear med or large in most items. the medium was huge. fit like a moo moo. size down by at least two.,neg
Chic and comfortable even in 90 degree heat. so easy to wear.,pos
"I am in love with the pilcro brand. this pair is gorgeous. i love the how versatile these will be in my wardrobe. i can dress them up with a nice blazer, sweater or dress them down with t-shirts or tanks. these will be a staple in my wardrobe. they are a nice navy blue.",pos
"This dress is made with stretchy cottony fabric, yet, very forgiving. it fits like a glove but doesn't show bulges. fit is perfect, i had originally purchased the white and grey, but the petite length is better. too bad as i do love me some red. oh well.",pos
"I purchased the raspberry color and it is beautiful. even though the sweater is very long and covers your bottom, it is surprisingly flattering. great with the booties or boots and skinny jeans. i am 34, 30, 37 and purchased a size small which, fits perfectly.",pos
The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!,pos
This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways.. the color is rich and classy,pos
"This bunches up too much, and the fabric is even more see through than i expected (so even with a tank top under it, it's not a good look for work). even unbuttoned at the top, i could barely get this over my head!  this one is going back.",neg
"Just wanted to let readers know that the dress doesn't flare out at the bottom like it shows on the model. for me, that's a good thing. it definitely sways and swishes, but doesn't flare out. you definitely have to wear a slip with it, not because it's see-through at all (it's not), but because of the static. 

also, this is the perfect dress for belt-lovers.",pos
"I'm 5'3"" with high waist and some booty. this dress has a fantastic, flattering fit. i paired it with the elita belt as opposed to the thicker belt on the long waisted model. (love the belt too, btw).  the fabric is soft and will pair well with tshirt or cami underneath. i plan to wear with brown booties as well as sandals. looking for a suede jacket now...",pos
Love this top. purchased for family photos and i think it's great. personally i don't think the model shot is doing it justice - it's much prettier in person. runs true to size for retailer. i am a 34d and i purchased a small.,pos
"This dress fits very nicely, i didn't keep it as i have too many dresses, but loved the fit. hip was a little looser compared to the top, you can almost see it on the model if you look closely, the dies poke out a bit. the teal color is very flattering on my pale skin tone. love the back, you can actually zip it all the way (mid back) with the tie in the neck, leaving a nice cutout... 0p fit me (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist) 30 dd).",pos
Most of my jeans are ag. love the ankle length and wash on these. not too distressed either. tts. really soft denim! size 27 like my other ag's,pos
"As cute in person as the picture shows. good quality, worth the money!",pos
"These are comfy and cool. i got the blue, which is more royal than navy. in opinion, it goes well with almost anything! i can wear all the neutral colors, in addition to orange, red, yellow and patterns. they are flattering and like other reviewers, i went up a size to 28 in the blue. perfect length, not too short. got the same version last year in white, 27. 5'4"", 128lbs",pos
"I bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well- in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size. when i reordered my normal size, it was a pretty good fit. i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it- it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where i'd hoped to wear it.",pos
"This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement, i'm so happy that it went on sale! definitely worth it!",pos
"I really love the colors of this top, especially in the pinky pastels. it fits really well, can be tied or untied, and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts. speaking of that, i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer ""am i hiding a pregnancy"" feel to it. 

but...the price tag. $98 for a tank blouse is just too much for me. i will save this one in my shopping bag and hope it's still available once it goes on sa",pos
This is a really pretty top that you can dress up or down. the draping on the neck and shoulders falls nicely and i love the back with the lace. it is simple but unique and has nice classic lines. i am usually a pxs but based on the measurements i went with the regular xxs and glad i did bc the petite would have been too short.,pos
I bought this top in the black color and it's great! the lace sleeves are so soft- not itchy at all and it is very flattering.,pos
"Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store. it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down. wore it to work already and got so many compliments. 
unfortunately when i saw it in store they didn't have it in stock. the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine, ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size. so he checked the stores that carried it. i called one and the mailed it to me. customer service in store is great!",pos
Really cute stress! i love the pattern and feel that this dress you can easily dress up or dress down. the neckline is the main reason why i bought the dress. it is a dress that hits above my knees so i like how modest it is. the slightly open back is also a nice touch. it's a dress that can easily be dressed up or dressed down. perfect spring dress!,pos
"I disagree with reviewers who said the dress looked cheap, cavernous or stiff. quite the opposite. i wore this to my 32nd anniversary dinner, and two women stopped me to say i was stunning. i am an average medium hourglass. the dress arrived in 2 weeks and was true to size. i wore a nude lace strapless bra underneath. the hem reaches the bottom of my kneecaps. the lace sleeves were not tight on my fleshy arms. the neckline lays flat. the dress zips in back, and the silver hooks in front are most",pos
"My new favorite dress. very flattering beautiful color, and great length. fabric feels very good as well. i'm usually s/m, purchased the medium and it fits perfectly",pos
"This is such a great casual fall sweater. it's so comfortable, has a bit of design too it, and it goes with everything! i bought it in the grey and love it! fits a bit big",pos
"I tried these on in the store in the small and needed to xs, so i ordered them online. they are perfect! i wore them last night and got so many compliments. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 125 lbs.",pos
I love these pants. bought them in both black and burgundy. but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning. they weren't even tight. so disappointing. i will be returning them.,neg
"The color, design and fabric of this top (got it in the red) were just as i expected, but as the owner of several deletta brand tops, i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank. not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes, and the top just hangs on me. it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large. 
bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style. will try an x-s",neg
"I love everything about this vest! comfortable and cute, great transition piece into spring.",pos
"I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. 
people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.",pos
I love this! i pair it with jeans or leggings and it works wonderfully. it's comfortable and stylish and a necessary addition to my wardrobe. it's a staple piece that i know i'll be able to use for years.,pos
"I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small",neg
"This beautiful blouse first caught my eye in the store. i thought it was a bit pricey, but couldn't keep thinking about it. walked away without it! then i went online and it had gone on sale! i knew i had to have it. the large fit perfectly! i got so many compliments on the blouse. i wore it with skinny jeans and little boots! i couldn't be happier with this gorgeous blouse!",pos
This is such a cute and different jacket. of course i asked if they had it in black but i am glad they didn't because this is such a great color that is so versatile. i use it as a topper when it is not that cold out with a short sleeve under it or a long sleeve fitted shirt. you can wear with jeans or black pants if you want. great material for the price as well. i am usually between a small but more of a medium in my jackets. i ordered this in xs/s and it has plenty of room to even wear a swea,pos
"This screams the old school classic retailer that we all love. it was one of my rare full price purchases because it's just perfection! i'm 5'4, 112lbs and normally and xs. however, when i tried on an xs is store i felt that it sort of swallowed me up. i went ahead and ordered an xs petite even though i rarely go with petites, but it fits perfectly. it doesn't leave room for layering, but i live in socal, so i don't need to layer often.",pos
"I am always a fan of retailer cardigans, but this one exceeded my expectations. the quality is a work of art, especially the back and the color, i chose the green, is so unique and beautiful. you will not be disappointed, go for it!",pos
"These do run small for pilcro which i think runs large overall. after reading other reviews i decided to get the size i would order in ag or coh and the like. thanks fellow reviewers because i'm pleased. when i first put them on i said no. the waist was a tad big (but comfy# and the legs seemed tight. with the slits at the bottom going right to my ankle (29 inch inseam) i thought these looked ridiculous. however, once i had them on for about 10 minutes they just sort of molded to my body and loo",pos
"I was a little bit afraid to purchase this because of the price, but i am so glad i did because this is a gorgeous swimsuit. the quality is amazing, and the colors are exactly as pictured. i have a small-ish frame with a big bust, and this style keeps my figure very flattering without making my chest look too big or heavy.",pos
"I didn't even notice this tee online, but in person in the store, i instantly loved it. then trying it on, loved it even more. it is flattering without being too tight. i got an xs, which is my usual size. i'm not a huge fan of the 3/4 sleeve length in winter, so i almost wish it had been either long or short sleeve, but no biggie, i still love!",pos
I ordered this sweater online in a size xs and the order was cancelled because it was out of stock. i ended up finding a sm at my local retailer and was so happy! it worked just perfectly. i'm usually an xs but the sm worked great. it is a thick knit and may snag so i'm being careful with it. simply meant to be:),pos
"I love this dress! splurged while i was doing my christmas shopping to get this for myself, and i'm so glad i did! it's such a comfortable dress - stretchy and not too thin or too heavy of a fabric. it pairs well with tights and a long cardigan in the winter, or on it's own with a statement necklace. style and fit are great - this dress is super flattering,",pos
"The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t",neg
"When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.",pos
"After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale. i'm tall and lean, but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures. firstly, the top has a strange transition to the skirt, with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together. if you blouse it and lay flat, it invariably gets bunched as you wear it. this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks, creating less clean lines. i also found the blue, black",neg
I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did. it's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect. i like the length of the shirt.,pos
"But like other reviewers said, it looks nothing like the picture of the model. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs, i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite - the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material, it looks like i'm 6 months pregnant. and i usually love loose dresses like this, but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes. so bummed, because the material is beautiful and i lo",neg
Bought one for myself and one for my mom.  we both love it.  super soft. boxy and oversized but great for layering over a belted tunic.,pos
"I know the photos for this dress show it as a very ""casual"" dress, but i find it very elegant.i really love this dress. it is very simple, but that is what makes it stunning. . the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly. it fits really nice on top - my bra fits just fine underneath and doesn't show. i'm a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite. i'm fine with that. nice quality, fits well - done deal for me!",pos
"I wanted these culottes to work so much! the fabric is gorgeous, but the size i ordered didn't fit. i'm normally a size 28 in pants, and i ordered a size 8. it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area. not what i wanted it to be. had to return them unfortunately.",neg
"I noticed this outfit earlier this year and remarked to my husband how heavenly it was. i couldn't bring myself to buy it since i shy away from strapless outfits (this lady is a small chested diva). to my delight- my wonderful husband remembered my gushing, and surprised me with this outfit for christmas! imagine a 33-year-old dancing around the house holding up this outfit - because that is what happened. this outfit it truly a work of art. it has a lined bodice with soft boning that fits perfe",pos
"Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9"" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory, black, grey, and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price.",pos
This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.,pos
I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!,pos
"Cool, comfortable, goes with everything! i found both colors at my local antro today!! almost ordered the grey online because that's all that was available, but decided to check my store first. so glad i did. the peach is so pretty, and looks really good with my blond hair. the grey looked much more like a faded black, darker than pictured online, imo. i would have still purchased it in grey if that's all they had, because it is such a great piece, but the peach really is lovely. i'm 5'10"" 145 p",pos
"This dress is gorgeous. i tried it on in the store several weeks ago and loved it, but the cost was a deterrent. when it went on sale, i ordered it immediately. hoping it gets here soon! the fit is wonderful, length perfect, embroidery just beautiful, and quality is excellent. it is versatile, too; easy to dress down with a sweater and boots, and beautiful for a more formal event like a wedding. for fit reference, i am 5'8"", 130 lb and ordered size 6 (this was the correct fit in the store). exci",pos
"The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.

an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.

unlike her, this was not one of those times. i've worn this daily, for weeks and feel like the buttons, trim and weave could not be any better. not only that but it looks terrific with everything. the sweater has a flattering line that tapers at the waist even unbuttoned. it is soft, warm and cl",pos

this is a wonderfully soft and warm sweater. the pink color is heathered with some grey and goes with just about any neutral bottom. the neckline was a little fiddly when i first tried it on, however like one of the previous reviewers i folded the left side under a bit to make an asymmetrical cowl neck, and it lays very nicely and looks great. runs a little big, i tried the medium and it fits perfectly. another great sweater from moth!",pos
"So glad to see high waisted jeans again! very soft, very comfortable, and the raw edge hem makes them just edgy enough!",pos
I am loving this shirt. i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not. for me this is a great substitute for the cloth & stone fringed plaid buttondown dress. it's definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a t-shirt and this on top. it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is. highly recommend.,pos
"I debated whether or not to order this dress. i love the cut and style, but i was afraid the color would not work for me. with dark hair and pale skin, yellow tends to wash me out. i was correct, but the dress was adorable. definitely size down. i usually wear a medium or 8 in retailer dresses, but based on other reviews, i ordered this in a small. might could have used an extra small. this dress certainly won't show off those 10 pounds you lost, but it is very comfortable and not overly boxy. als",pos
Great transition into fall. super soft and comfy. great yellow without being too yellow love it.,pos

"Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined. sort of like heavy drapes. also, the length (as others mentioned) was too long. i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long. unfortunately, it has to go back.",neg
I wasn't sure about this dress because some of retailer's cloths can make a women appear older before her time. i have to say that is not the case with this dress. i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on. i'm 5'6 115lbs and it fit perfect. the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin. i won't even need sunless tanner. i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again.,pos
"This dress looks cute online, but it is enormous. i bought a small, but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on, just in case, and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo.",neg
Loved this jacket so much i bought both colors! this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit. the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons. as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands. the sizing i think runs a bit large. i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room. highly recommend,pos
If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse. the problem area is evident looking at the photo --the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice. i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house.,neg
This is a great skirt. i am always on the lookout for machine washable clothes that are fun and work appropriate. this skirt is really flattering on my body. the only thing that's a little off is the tie at the front but it's still really stunning on.,pos
"The fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering, it doesn't stick out too far over the butt. the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall. looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights. i'm usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one.",pos
"I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.",pos
"I bought this in a beautiful cornflower blue at my retailer store. i don't see that color for sale online. the blue material was not thin or see through, but perhaps the white is. the fit is very structured, which helps me cover my mom belly. i have never said this before, but i think it looks better on me than it does on the model wearing white. on sale, i got this for about $20. i got it for a steal. i like the different directions of line patterns and the length is nice too. one thing you can't",pos

"This dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger. the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size. i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly. it is a bit short however, so i would caution that it may not be work ""office"" appropriate if you are taller. like most hd in paris dresses, it is also quite thin although lined. this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or",pos
"I bought a few of these tops in the long sleeved version during the fall/winter, so i was super excited to see the short sleeved version come out! in this brand, i can wear an xs or s - i typically wear a s in retailer tops. if you need a tee that covers your lady parts when wearing leggings, this is it! it perfectly covers my rump and looks great. it's a nice weight, too. the detailing down the back is a nice touch.",pos
"This gathered jersey dress is beautiful and flows in just the right places, however it runs large! i normally wear a small in many retailer dresses, however i ordered an xs petite in this dress based on other reviews. i'm glad i did because it fits perfectly. the dress is very flattering in the bust...and the rest of the dress hangs and flows nicely. this can be dressed up (with statement jewelry) or down depending on the occasion. i'm happy with my purchase, so much so that i bought one in",pos

"I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer, but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware, this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge",pos
I bought this in black and i can already tell this is going to be a staple this fall and winter. the unusual hem and extra long sleeves are really flattering.,pos
It is so simple but elegant and beautiful! i am 5'3 and 120 lb and extra small fits me perfectly,pos
I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks.,pos
"Love this top. makes me look slimmer, comfortable as well",pos
"I bought this after eyeing it for months, when it went on sale! the colors are bright and so pretty! the blue very warm, flattering in intensity. this pattern is very unique and the suit is well made. there is some stretch, making it not a chore to pull on.  the bust padding is minimal (like a tshirt bra) best for a & small b cups. no underwire no shaping in cups. the halter has enough room to be comfortable and secure. i felt this fit more like a 0 on the bottom (hips) and a 2 for top portion,",pos
I wore this sweater while gathering ingredients for my thanksgiving feast and 3 different women at whole foods complimented my sweater. it is soft and warm. would love in other colors too...like a mint green.,pos

"I can't say enough about this top! absolutely adorable, the pics don't do it justice. it is made of a soft, medium weight jersey material. the lace makes the top more dressey and unique. the drop waiste elongatesy our torso and is loose pleated at the bottom for interest. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds, and long waisted. this fits me perfect (sz small.) the pleated bottom on me begins at low hips (below belly button) so it layes nice and is very flattering. no swing to the top,no bulky extra flare at al",pos
Great denim color and fit. gives a nice feel to the waist.,pos
"Everything about this dress is perfect for my body type.  i used the tie belt as a cinch to gather the fabric and made the silhouette into a loose fit & flare.  i have a large upper body and small lower half so maybe the excess fabric balances out my body but looks terrible on other shapes.  i am 36dd 140# 5'3"" and i purchased the medium petite.",pos
"I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful, fit is impeccable, no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and ordered the small.",pos
"This dress first caught my eye because of the beautiful color combination. and when i tried it on, i was sold. it's super soft and comfy and just the right amount of coverage.",pos
Love this dress!! will go from fall to winter. so comfy. got it in medium.. and fits great.,pos
It's just not for me and i really like it. it's made very well and it looks great from the front. not so much from the side. i'm a 36c and this shirt bells out a lot from my chest...so much that i will be returning it. i look like i have an extra 20 lbs. on me.,pos
"Bought this because i don't have a puffer vest and living in san diego, i wanted a layering piece. it's much cuter on, but it does like much of retailer's clothes run a bit small. got tons of compliments on it when i wore it while shopping round town. very pricey but since the hood detaches and it's reversible, i guess it's worth it! (treat yo'self!)",pos
"I agree with the other reviewer who said she cannot believe it's not flying off the shelf. this looks gorgeous on and the fit is perfect. i ordered my usual size m. i am 5'3"" 34dd and it looks amazing. it is breezy and flowing but without the baggy look. it is so cute with jeans or leggings. the fabric is the perfect weight- light but still thick enough that it's comfortable and my light bra is not seen underneath. love this top!!!",pos

This vest is super cute on. it definitely has kept me warm this winter.,pos
"This is a beautiful coat. no one has mentioned how beautifully the pattern matches, even across the arms coordinating with the front. i love the lower button as it allows for arm movement and contributes to the casual slouch. the only complaint i have is there is a slight dark spot above both pockets. this appears to be a sewer's mark for placement. i think i have figured out how to disguise it without marring the fabric; but second item from retailer with marks (quality control?). i am keeping th",pos
"I got this coat because i needed something black and thought the plaid was black. it's not -- but that's my fault and i love it anyway! it's perfect for our temperate seattle fall and winter -- not too light, not too heavy. i get a ton of compliments! i'm 5'9"" and about 145, and a medium fits perfectly.",pos
"I immediately purchased this dress when it came into store. at 5'7"" it hits enough above the knee to be flirty, but still not too short and is appropriate for me to wear to work. sleeves are fitted which helps to balance the trapeze fit. i'm just concerned with keeping the lace in good condition, but overall i love the dress.",pos
"Absolutely perfect for summer. great weight, lovely soft lining. love pockets in any robe. sleeve length is perfect. actually flattering, if you consider robes such a thing. i love it!",pos
"It's thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline, but unfortunately it's scratchy will not last. i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears. it's a nice shade of offwhite at least. for me it's a no that will get sent back straight away.",neg
"I was obsessed with this dress/jumpsuit after i read all the great reviews, even tho i had never seen it in person. it was already on sale and sold out online, so i called a bunch of stores and finally was able to track one down in the navy colorway in my size (it's tts). so glad i made the effort! it's as great as everyone says it is. i love how it's ""party in the back."" i'm 5'3"" so it was pretty much floor length on me.",pos
I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size.,pos

"This is not your traditional moth sweater, in that, it is not soft and cozy. this sweater is great for upcoming summer nights at the beach while fireside or out on the boat! i haven't been the biggest fan of the lace up trend but this one is more traditional nautical feeling than others which i did like. it's pretty true to size, so i wouldnt size up or down for any reason. they paired it with a cloth + stone white button down underneath at our store and it looks great layered too!",pos
"I love these jeans, well,i have not worn them out yet so not sure if they will stretch, but just in terms of fit and cut, i really like them. i normally wear ch or ag in 25 or 26. i got these in 25 and they fit perfectly. i love the stretch, great color, not too thin, very comfie. i was worried about too much flare, but not a problem. they are very long, but i am only 5""2 and i will be hemming them about 8 inches .",pos
"This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.",neg
"This dress is so beautiful, the color is even more vibrant in person, a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm, which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top, look at the back view photo online, you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view, but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer",pos
I am so glad that i got this sweater.it is just perfect!,pos
I wish this fit me better. i love the inside fur. it is extremely soft but it doesn't look flattering at all. it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted. it wanted it fit over my butt (or cover half) and it sits a little below my waist. unfortunately i am taking it back. great idea though.,neg
I'm dying for this skirt in the picture. where is it??,pos
"I found this set once while browsing the website. i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it. as luck would have it, my mom surprised me with a gift card, so i applied it to my purchase. i'm so happy with the set. it's wonderfully flattering, and makes me feel sexy. i want one in every color!",pos
Great material. quality and versatility is there. it is easy to get in and out of which is hard to find and the fit is adjustable at the waist.,pos
"I don't normally write reviews, but i love this shirt!  it's sooo soft and hangs perfectly. not to mention it takes what could be a boring t-shirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves. it's beyond comfortable. i purchased one and went back immediately to get another! i can tell these will be some of my go-to tees. plus, they are a steal on sale!  i am 5'5, 135 and medium is perfect.",pos
"I saw the two star review and wanted to share my opinion. i saw this item that had been returned to a store and i love it. the fabric is a bit sheer and i think will require a nude tank underneath, but i think it's adorable. don't be scared away by the review below!",pos
"I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.
it runs a little big, so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side, but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.",pos
"Currently wearing right now :)
purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l, and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath, as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.
a must at the tag sale price!",pos
I am in love with this top! it is so comfortable and lovely. it runs a touch big like most items of this brand.,pos

Not much to say. fits tts. a beautiful top. colors are striking!!,pos
"This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34",pos
"This was a bit of an impulse purchase but i'm glad i added it! it's a pretty standard tank, but is thoughtfully and well made. for example, the arm holes are not enormous like they are on some tops. i wish everything fit like this. the cut at the neckline isn't too modest or too low and the fold over of the drawstrings are structured enough that they don't flop over.",pos
"I am so happy with this! i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it as i expected it to be of lesser quality than what i found it to be. it is a medium weight weave, grey sweater with a beautiful design and texture; one of those pieces that you will tire of long before it wears out! it is a great layering piece but not over bulky or structured tops as it is very smooth fitting without a whole lot of give. that is to say it is not loosely woven so it is better over a snug fitting item. the colo",pos

I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!,pos

"I really love these leggings. the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting. quality is great. i am 5 1"" and 125lbs. the s/m fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option. but still would not hesitate to buy again!! i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colors,...that's how happy i am with this purchase!",pos
"This dress is a great dress for spring and summer (and early fall) events. it's surprisingly light weight and comfortable. you can pair different shoes with the dress due to the various colors which makes it easy to dress up and down. i definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun, floral, feminine dress.",pos
"The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

Great fitted tee. nice styling. hard to find tees that are fitted-- they seem to make most of them these days like boxes i suppose because it's easier to make. this looks great and feels good. true to size. loving it!,pos

"I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short.",neg
"Oh how i have searched for a mid-rise bottom that was not matronly, and finally i have found one! they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt, and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color. and speaking of the color, the blue is beautiful. i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years. i am 125 lbs and the small fit perfect.",pos

Great top that can be worn so many ways. i bought the top in gray because it is way more interesting in person. it has just a touch of sparkle in it and lots of texture. i have seen this top on several people and it seems to flatter lots of different body types.,pos

definitely a keeper!",pos
Saw this top online and knew i had to have it! it's unique and gorgeous with the split back and two-layer design. the top layer is thicker and almost like a brocade/tapestry design with rich purple and yellow tones. the under layer is sheer and lightweight. i was able to wear this early in my pregnancy and it totally disguised any bump i had from co-workers. this is def one of my top 10 fav tops now!,pos

What a classy special top. really dresses up a pair of black slacks. i actually think this is a perfect spring piece!,pos
"I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel, this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes, i would order down.",pos

"I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual, yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress, i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace, this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly, comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up, but want to wear something that is not fussy. and, the pockets!",pos
The dress runs big you should size down. i find the weight to be great for mild winter weather. the length was longer than i expected based on previous reviews.,pos
"I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt. i dried it on medium. i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly. i loved the color (lilac). fit, and style when i received it and immediately put it on. so sad about the shrinkage. for a $58 shirt i expected a bit more. retailer should suggest air drying the shirt. so bummed and disappointed!!!! i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time.",neg
"I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. 

such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.",neg

"I did not like this top at all-but had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have. it is polyester-i thought it was cotton so there's the first reason i didn't like it. secondly, there is a piece of fabric behind the laces, presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat. it wrinkles up behind the lacing, making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top. it is too long for me, the top hitting at top of thigh.
this top is just reall",neg

Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems. i think i'd like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie. the tie seems like an after thought. it's flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house -- no matter there size. i ordered a medium black and it's already in the mail!,neg

This sweater coat is a keeper. yes it runs large but if you wear it as a coat and not a sweater it works well. plus it is very warm. for size i normally wear a large 12/14 and i ordered a medium. great for layering soft winter whites. i wore this christmas shopping and everyone asked about it all day. this will for sure go into my retailer classic closet.,pos

"I found this at my local store on sale and immediately snatched it up. i did not think of the wrap flying open until i got home and tried it on again. luckily, i was able to sew it up enough without compromising the drape and movement of the dress and without causing anyou pulling or puckering which isn't always easy when working with jersey.

that said, i really like the dress otherwise. it's super soft and i think i'll get a lot of wear out of it when i want something cute and comfy to put on.",pos
I own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same. i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute. they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build. nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy!,pos
I am super happy with the t-shirt....it fits true to size and the cut outs are a great detail!! i'm thinking about buying another!!,pos
"This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l",pos

"I love this top. it was everything i hoped it would be. it is lined so it is not see through in the chest/back; sleeves are sheer. soft. gorgeous color. love the layers. runs large so definitely size down. i am usually a m and ordered the s. i'm 5'8"" curvy 32dd",pos
"I have been eyeing these jeans for a while but was hesitant because of the price and also because i'm short waisted so don't normally like high rise pants. i finally pulled the plug when i had a 15% off code (still expensive imo). i am so glad i finally bought them - they are well worth the price! i am 5'6"" with longer legs and i agree with the other reviewers that these run a little longer than one might anticipate. they hit about 2 inches above my ankle bone, which suits me just fine. they are",pos
Beautiful top! you can wear it as a wide boat neck or as its pictured off the shoulder. the bottom is tight with ruching which makes it very flattering. i found the fit true to size. love the neutral light brown color. will look nice with white denim for the summer. excited to dress this unique top up or down.,pos
"This sweater is so well made and uniquely designed. one of the main reasons i love retailer is for how toy make wool sweaters, timeless, affordable, and versatile.

worth the money!",pos
"The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture, it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans, or dressing down something fancier.",pos
This was completely different than i expected. the xs/s was so large that it looked messy. unfortunately i had to return it.,neg
"I really like this top.  for reference, i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large, however, in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely.  in any brand other than retailer, my usual size is m as i am 36d bust, 132 lbs., 5""5.",pos
"When i received this dress in the mail, i was thrilled. i loved the color and the style, although a bit too much material but comfortable. when i went to show my husband the dress, his first comment was very sexy. i can see your underwear and your skin!!! i don't understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress. when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it.",neg
"Saw this online, but it said the store was out of stock. imagine my surprise when i went to my local store and found it in both a small and a medium in white.. i tried them both on, but not a lot of difference in the sizing. the small had a smaller head/neck opening causing it to be a bit tough to remove without getting makeup on it, which the small did. the medium fit very very close to the small, but a smidge bigger at the neck. the shoulders of both seemed to fit the same, with maybe a tad mo",pos
"Saw these in the store and had to have them. i wear them rolled up. they are lightweight. whenever i wear them i want to smile. the birds with hats are so funny. i wear them to run errands, have worn them when flying, etc. can't say enough good things about these pants. they wash well, no ironing needed.",pos
I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!,pos
This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it. i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird. it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top. had to go back.,neg
"Love, love, love this top. i want to wear it every day! not only is it striped, which is super chic, but also, the peplum hits lower so it really accentuates your waistline (in a good way!). plus, its soft, like so many wonderul bordeaux tops are. i wish they had this is solid colors because i'd buy them all. for reference, i bounce between an xs and s at retailer, more along the lines of s...and i got the xs in this and it still has room (5'7, 135 lbs, 34a/b chest).",pos
"I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top. 
the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off. 
i felt that it flowed perfectly, not as full as some of the fall retailer tops. (which are too full for me.)
i am around 5'6"" and a little on the broad side, so perhaps on someone smaller it might be overbeari",pos
"I adore this top. it is super soft, drapes nicely, and looks great with a ton of different bottoms. i am 5'4"", 104 lbs., and ordered this in both xs (my usual size), and s. i ended up keeping the s (most cloth & stone xs tops swim on me, so i was a little surprised), but glad i tried both. my only concern is how it will hold up after washing it. it is a gauze-like material, and i just hope i can get a long life out if this top.",pos
Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.,pos
"I bought this beautiful  dress at the store yesterday and had some assistance from staff,  which was great.  the tie,  that another reviewer referred to, is essential,  i believe.  when tied in the back,  slightly high and sinched just enough to define smallest part of waist,  it falls beautifully and frames the center panel perfectly.  i, personally,   would never cut the tie off.  at least try it this way before making that decision.",pos
The front of this top is pretty thin and you can see through it,pos
"I absolutely love this tee! i normally don't buy two of the same thing, but i bought it in both black and mauve during a december sale. i ordered a size small, and it fits tts. it can be worn with leggings or skinny jeans/cords. i love pairing it with skinny jeans and boots best. it's very slimming and so soft.",pos
"The reviews are right about these fitting perfectly in the fitting room, i knew right off i had to get them. i have a flat rear end and these make my rear look great! i'm 5'5 about 130 lbs. and i chose the 29. i initially bought both the 28 and 29' to make sure they would not stretch out and the didn't. i didn't want to be squeezed in with the 28. i think they are very well made and i'll love wearing them for a long time.",pos
Retailerpologists has always carried the best sweatpants. i wish they sold these in more colors. very flattering!,pos
"Button down shirts usually aren't my thing, but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look. it's also easy to dress up or down, which is great! i am 5'4"" and small-framed, and the size 0 fits just right.",pos
"I love this top!!!! the design, quality, and look are all insanely gorgeous. i got this top during the 20% off tops promo, which helped so much with the cost, and i was trying to use up a store credit i had on something of high quality. (after going through a whirlwind of exchanges that resulted in much disappointment.) i couldn't be more thrilled with this choice! it is so flattering on, beautiful color and cut. the only complaint i have is slightly minor, and it's in relation to the hidden bac",pos
Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it.,neg
"Ordered the biggest size available, the large. the arms are so tight, i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms, either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.",neg
"I love this dress. my favorite retailer purchase in years. it is perfect. looks great- no need for ironing and is really sexy for the length and amount of material. i would buy it 10 more times if i could. 

yes!",pos
Love these jeans! the material is soft and very flattering on the hips.,pos
"The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it, however, i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.",neg
"This is the perfect cool day, cozy, teacher sort of sweater or if you're having a mr rogers sort of day. the material is soft and comfortable and the color is just as it appears in the photo. looks great with a button down shirt underneath.",pos
"I absolutely love this dress. i'm always leery about buying lace and white, but i love this off-white color and style. i was able to stretch the sleeves a tad to make them more fluttery, but they aren't as fluttery as the photo looks. definitely more of a cap sleeve. got so many compliments!",pos
These shorts are very flattering. will def. purchase another pair.,pos
"It drapes perfect and washes well. i own all the colors, they do not disappoint. i'm a medium.",pos
"I love this top!! i got lucky and found it returned at a store (always always check the ""found and collected racks ladies!) it was a 6 and i was a little worried it would be much to large, but it fit great! i like that i can wear something under it or on its own. i didn't fit it too short, but i'm a little under 5'7"" and roughly 127 lbs, 32/34a. highly recommend!",pos
I bought this in the blue motif and i love the colors of the plaid. the first day i wore it i received many compliments. the armholes are a bit low but i wore a cami underneath. i don't think it is that noticeable unless your arms are raised the whole time. i like my shirts to be a bit longer and this is perfect since i have a longer torso. i am normally a size 6/m/34b and the med fit perfectly.,pos
"I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3), but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume., and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!",pos
"The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touch.
i layer it with various camis for a different look each time.
i ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade, and goes well with so other many colors.
looks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effect.
classic yet unique!
runs very true to size.",pos
I purchased this top over the weekend and absolutely love it. i am currently 9 months pregnant (due in a week) and this top is perfect bc it has plenty of length. it is super soft and comfortable for the texas heat. i am 5'6'' usually 115 lbs currently closer to 140 lbs.,pos
"This blouse does have a flowy, boxy shape to it but the details make up for that. when i wear it tucked into a skirt it looks wonderfully flattering. i tried on an xs and considered looking for a xxs but i feel that size would probably end up being too short instead of more fitted.",pos
This is a beautiful light weight sweater. great for the texas weather. the red is a great color for the holidays too.,pos
"I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect, straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.",pos

"I have other pilcro cord leggings & the black ponte knit leggings in my usual size 28 in this brand. they fit well & have a nice stretch - very comfy. i ordered these velvet leggings in the 28, the blue & the wine, & they just don't fit the same as the others. these are a little short in the crotch area & the legs feel restrictive & not much give. i have skinny legs! length is perfect though at the ankle. these same exact pants were just in at the store in black & fit a little better, but i don'",pos
This is an adorable dress. medium weight. i highly recommend.,pos
"I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price. it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket. the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining. in addition, the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba",neg
"This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat, i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it. i'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material. i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying it.",pos
They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable.,pos

"This is really a gorgeous blouse. the design is very feminine and elegant, and fits true to size. i didn't think it ran short and the material is light and airy. it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second. it was def. worth the wait. a gorgeous top.",pos
"I wanted to give this top some love. i ordered this top and the kota peasant top with plans to only keep one of them. this top is definitely the winner. the neckline, sleeves, pattern, fabric, and length are gorgeous and flattering. it is very feminine and elegant and i think it will also be versatile....it could be very dressy (depending on what you wear it with) but it will also look great with jeans and shorts and sandals. it is a bit sheer so a tank or cami might be needed underneath. i orde",pos
"Yes, this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves, but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color, and after getting compliments, i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear, have an interesting detail at the neck, and could be layered. cozy, comfortable, stylish. love mine!",pos
"I ordered this dress to wear to a summer wedding in san francisco. i liked that it had sleeves, a plus. when i was trying it on, i found that it was a little snug, then realized it was the slip, which is not too tight at all once the dress is on. it helps to smooth those little bumps. it is drop waist style, which skims the torso, then flares out prettily. all in all very complimentary, beautiful color, well made. very pleased; it will be comfortable and perfect at the wedding.",pos
"Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring, they have a nautical feel to them.",pos
I found this at my local retailer. it is a beautiful unique sweater. it fits nicely a bit longer in the back and a tad loose on the bottom. i've gotten loads of compliments as it's truly special. i'm not sure why it's not sold out yet!,pos
"I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.",neg
"I've had my eye on this for awhile, glad it was still in stock.  really great deep wine color, soft.  more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture.  love.",pos
"Great skirt! i bought the red and paired it with a casual white button down. i feel like the top definitely needs to be short or tucked in for the look to work. i am typically a 2 in bottoms, and went with the small in this. the xs probably fits more like it's intended to, but it is very curve-hugging, and i was more comfortable with the looser fit of the small (especially since i am tucking in a blouse). there is stretch in the skirt, and the fabric has a nice feel.",pos
"I've worn this top with leggings and straight leg jeans. looks great with both. it's almost like a t shirt but not as clingy and way more style. i'm 5'3, 165 and the large fit great. it hid my leftover baby belly and still looked stylish with flats or boots. only complaintbis that the armholes are cut low, so side of my bra is visible. but overall it's well worth it!",pos
"Fits like a dream: not too tight, not too loose. arm holes aren't too big (a common problem for me in sleeveless retailer tops/dresses), the sweater material isn't itchy, and the pattern is unusual and eye-catching. i felt confident in this dress and received many compliments. great addition to the spring wardrobe.",pos
"Found this randomly in the store (online return) and didn't expect to like it but tried it on and fell in love with it. extremely comfortable dress, but also has a unique/special design that makes you feel great wearing it. will be perfect to wear out when don't want to look too dressed up or like trying too hard.",pos
Like these pants and they were on sale--does not get better!,pos
I just got this at the black friday sale..... i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood ( i usually wear brighter colors). it feels wonderful....cozy and silky like expensive pjs!! looks very glamorous yet laid back... i feel like i am in a 40's romantic film.. i got a ps and it fits flowy. it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs. love it! it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline .,pos
This coat is so beautiful! like others i wouldn't have even considered it online but i tried it on in the store and absolutely fell in love with. it is the softest material ever and is so flattering on.,pos
"I have a racetrack bra that works with the arm holes (a bit large - like you see on the model), so i am not concerned about them. i may or may not have my tailor tack them in. length was good, knee length (some of retailer dresses are a tad short for my 40-yr old self). shape was flattering. i've some weight on my bum and things, even though i'm small. the back of the dress hung well, not clinging to the derriã¨re. the swing shape didn't overly accentuate my hips. i really love the dress. it's a kn",pos
Absolutely love this skirt. it is well made and fits as normal. i love the fact that it can be dressed up or down.,pos

"Maeve once again created another beauty! love, love, love. i purchased the crocheted cape in cream and have received numerous compliments on the dress. get it while it lasts! i typically wear a 4-6 in maeve and got the 6 in this one.",pos
"I ordered the mauve in size xl and it fits true to size. it matched the photos online. all of the details are prettier in person. it's delicate. but, it's washed/dried well. very pretty shade of mauve.",pos
This is by far the most comfortable bra i've ever owned. i love the convertible strap feature. it's great for shirts with a back cutout.,pos
"This skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline, but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps. the skirt has a nice, wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too much.

the fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is lined.

i am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels.",pos
"This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can't tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b",pos
"This dress was so cute and comfortable! i said it runs big, but i think that may also simply be the style of it. i paired it with some cute boots and received many compliments! love it!!",pos
"This dress is of great quality and design. the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress. i am short and it is a little long on me; it is between my calf and my ankle, but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it. with the right shoes, it is a real winner! i think this dress would be flattering on every body type. highly recommend!",pos
"This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer, but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!",pos
"I was very excited when this top arrived in the mail! it is so, so beautiful. i love the material and the brightness of the colors. it will be a perfect top this holiday season.",pos
Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.,pos
"I seldom buy prints and almost never buy a traditional button front blouse but this shirt is my favorite purchase of the season. i chose the skier print as it was whimsical and subtle. rather than wear it buttoned and tucked i use it as a jacket over solid tees. i bought it a size larger for this reason. i like the layered look and the fabric is flowy and drapes nicely. i have been so pleased with every piece of ""maeve"" clothing i have purchased. once again thinking slightly outside my comfort-z",pos
"Yes it is boxy, but by design. because it is a shorter length and sheer it isn't an issue for me even as a petite. it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if it's just floating on your body. what doesn't show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse, charcoal & white threads running throughout the design. this adds to the classy look of this top.
great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out.",pos
"I've been looking for the right red dress for a while and this one is a winner! flattering fit, comfy quality fabric...makes me feel great even right after having a baby. fits tts and i can't wait to rock this beauty!",pos
"I purchased this in the green color, and in person it does have a little bit of blue in it so it's a very flattering color. the blouse has a simple shape but the details are what makes this an interesting piece. it looks as good under a suit as it does with jeans and a leather jacket. fits tts.",pos
"This is cute! i was hesitant to buy, but glad i did. it has a unique cut. the fit is tighter to the body, but it's very flattering. i purchased a xxs petite in the blue color. the blue seems more on the gray side to me, but it is mottled and really pretty. the neckline comes all the way up - as shown. the detail on the neckline and the ruffle shown at a bias is really cool. i love it. pair it with a skirt or jeans. adorable!",pos
"I happened upon this one in store in my xs size. online it would not catch my eye, but in person i love it. it fits like a glove and is so soft and elegant with the knit detailing, pleats, and length in the back. i couldn't pass this one up. i also agree with the other reviewers about colors:/",pos
"I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy, but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape), and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary, but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size, which helped, and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant, and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath, just bare skin,  but they're so small that i don",pos
"I adore this top! i ordered in the white and wear it with everything! i am a 34c and size 6 and purchased the xs. it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch. i just bought the black as well, as it truly it a great staple piece. forewarning: do not dry this! my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one, since it shrunk so much. the fabric is lightweight and great for summer, but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath (tank top, etc.)",pos
"I wasn't sure about this shirt at first glance, it's difficult to see in the picture but the top of the shirt and the peplum are two completely different fabrics, with the top having a much looser weave. however, it looks great on. the blue color is very saturated and pretty. the fit in the shoulders and arms is stretchy and comfortable. and it hangs in a really flattering and comfy way on my hourglass frame. i'm pretty busty, 36dd i think....i usually have to wear l in retailer tops unless they'r",pos
This top is so cute it's my go to top. dress up or down looks really cute with skinny skirt. i have the ivory and just ordered the dark grey. one great thing this top has pockets. i would buy this in many colors if i could. yes it's full but a cute full. but i love full tops. i think this is true to size it's not tight and i don't think it would be as cute tight. i actually like mine on me better than the one on the model.lol washes like a dream and you can dry it in the dryer.,pos

"As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.",neg

I tried it on in the store & loved it but didn't purchase. then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it. it's lightweight and perfect for southern california. the embroidery adds funk and femininity. i'm 45 and feel like this works well for any age. i'm typically a large or 12 and the large fit perfect. i can't wait till the temps drop so i can wear it!!!,pos

"Man, this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute , but is so, so, so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like",neg
"I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased-- hoping to try something new. they're not attractive. the slit stays open with any movement. i don't think it would be appropriate for work . overall the fit is true to size. i otherwise liked the design, but the sleeves made this a quick return ....",neg

Love how breezy this shirt is and adds unique texture & detailing to your outfit. the simple black color is a nice touch so the color does not compete with the detailing.,pos
"Yes, as much as i'd have liked this to be a true red, it's kind of red-orange; i am relieved, however that it is not as orange as it looks on my monitor! that is my only slight-and i mean slight-disappointment in this cute-as-all-get-out skirt! i am 5""5"" 140 lbs and the six is perfect, leading me to believe that this is tts. it is a polyester mix with a same-color liner, large buttons followed by smaller, silver colored buttons at the apron. the larger buttonholes are red and white striped and t",pos
"I'm 5' 3"", 115 pounds, and bought the xs in white. i actually wear this as a bathing suit cover-up instead of a top. i love that it's little longer in the back so it covers part of the back of my thighs. it's light weight, cool and comfortable. it is thin but has washed well with no pilling or holes so far. i've worn this several times and have had lots of compliments.",pos
"I wanted this immediately after seeing it in the catalog. i couldn't wait for it to get to my store so i ordered it and it did not disappoint! it is extremely flattering on my hourglass figure. the pattern and colors are amazing. the unlined lower half does not bother me. i will be wearing this with a denim jacket, light sweater, wedges, then booties in the fall! i fell like this dress will be able to be worn for years to come.",pos
"This is wearable avant-garde fashion! yes, the swing is oversized...it's supposed to be. that's the design! fits perfect at arms and across the chest. i'm 5'3, 127 and orders a 2p. it's perfection! just understand what you're buying. high fashion. high quality.",pos
"I absolutely love this dress. i feel it's the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium, depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back, it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru, though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north, with tights and boots, you can too. so worth the price!",pos
"Love this top! such a fun pattern and style. soft too! easily paired with a sweater or light weight denim/cargo jackets for fall. i generally wear an xs in retailer tops and purchased this in a 2 which is a perfect fit. it could be a tad more roomy in the chest, however the 4 would be too big overall.",pos
"I already have some dresses similar to this, but i couldn't help getting this one, too. i love the flowers, bees, and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket, so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light, floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.",pos
"This top was surprisingly very flattering. it hugged my curves in just the right way and the slits on the side are a nice touch. i'm 5'2"" and about a 34c and the xs was tight (in a good way) around my chest and then more flowy after. soft material and the red color is beautiful!",pos
"Based on the strength of the other reviews, i thought this sweater would be amazing, but i was disappointed. the knit is very thin, cheap looking and weak that it won't last a season undamaged. it reminds me of a duster i bought 15 years ago at a discount fast-fashion retailer when i was a student. sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package. collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare. the drape is not structured enough--everything about this screams over priced bath",neg
"This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also don't normally like high waisted ski",pos
"This top looks so pretty on the model. however, the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose. i am petite but between a c+ to d cup. the top is not really fitted, so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece. from the side it hung way in front of my body. i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model. if you are smaller chested and taller, this top might look nice on you. i am 5'1"", 105 lbs and c-d cup. i really loved the fabric and c",neg

"The photos shown here really do not do this bomber jacket justice! the colors of the embroidery are much deeper and richer in person! it is very well made, having no loose threads whatsoever. the retailer store where i bought mine featured this jacket over an ivory color lace blouse and it looked much more stunning than over the darker color that they show it here with. it does run true to size as the other reviewer mentioned too. i took my usual size large. i would say that if you're betwe",pos
"As the previous reviewer stated, this skirt is a stunner, can be worn in all four season. it's long and runs on the larger side. so that you compare, i'm 5'9"" and it goes all the way to the side of my foot. i'm 146lbs, 28 waist, 38 hips and always a medium on maeve, this skirt on a medium was too big for me, at least a size larger. take that into account when ordering. other than that it's a great purchase. can't wait for my exchange to arrive.",pos
"I bought this online in dark green after trying on the burgundy. i usually wear a medium (5'2"", 120) but i looked better in the small in this jacket. the combination of very deep green, black and tan is beautiful. the cut is very flattering with the jacket open or snapped closed. it is nice enough to wear with black pants or skirt but looks just as good with jeans. i am in my 60's and this look is chic and fresh without being too ""young"" for my age. it's also very well made. i love it.",pos
"I've been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby & so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together & always intending to remove the tack. i love it. the fabric is super soft. i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist & it's amazing. with the tack in, it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned, so it's not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack & wear something un",pos

"I tried on this dress in the portland, me, store today. so much good to say about it: the wine color is deep and rich, the fabric hand is similar to a heavy weight silk, the cut of the dress so flattering.
but, i didn't get it. i am 5'2"" and weigh 135 lbs. i can sometimes wear a medium, but my upper arms and hips can require a large, usually petite for proper length. the store didn't have a large (i didn't even realize the dress also came in petite), so i tried on a medium. nice fit through the",pos
"I ordered a medium as the large in the store was a bit too big. i wore this dress to a casual dinner at the grill in the country club and felt so cute, but also comfortable. i think it is a flattering dress shape and fabric. looks just like pictured on your website.",pos
"I bough this in the blue green color and it's absolutely beautiful -- just as it appears online. actually the shirt in general looks just like it does online -- it's fitted up top and flowy everywhere else. this may be because i'm fairly straight-figured -- it's possible it would be less flattering on a bigger bust. i agree with the other reviewers who say the fabric wrinkles too easily. i am sometimes an xs and sometimes a s, and i ordered the s in this and like how it fits. note: in meadow rue",pos
Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect. material is soft. comfortable to wear. can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats. fits true to size.,pos
"I saw this dress in the store in the coral color and tried it on. i am 5'4"", 34b, and slender to athletic build. i wear the size 2 in this dress. as far as sizes go for retailer, i would say it is tts. the slip fits like it should and the dress is flowing. it is not see through as were some of the other silk dresses this summer. it feels so comfortable and makes me feel pretty. it is a flowing dress and meant to fit that way. i waited for it to go on sale and the day it did i purchased it!!!",pos
"True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue ""jeans""; perfect outfit for almost all occasions.",pos
"Wore this to work and nearly everyone complimented me on it. very comfortable. lots of detailing. perfect for fall. pockets! i'm usually somewhere between a s and m but this piece was generously cut and a s was perfect. i debated ordering the petite, but actually the regular cut was the perfect length even though i'm only 5'4"".",pos

I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you. it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath.,pos
The holding horses brand never ceases to amaze me. this dress is gorgeous in person! i have received so many compliments while wearing this dress. the lace is intracately crafted and the lilac color is perfect. i actually have this magnolia dress in black as well and i might even get the new reddish color too. needless to say i'm obsessed with this dress?,pos
"This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access, or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material, but not worth it if it's difficu",neg
Cozy. soft. comfortable. a perfect transitional top that bubbles over with personality..it's a unique fabric design that makes you feel like you're on vacation ..love it.,pos
This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings. sundry's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool. the fit is true to size. the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice. i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along!,pos
"I love this skirt, wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so (when i saw it was almost sold out in my size, which it is now). another thing is it doesn't come in petite - boohoo.
anyway, ordered the 0 (smallest size) for my 26.5 in waist - didn't have any trouble with the waist being too tight, like some other reviewers. it fit really well and comfortably. sits at the natural waist, so the hem isn't too crazy low on me. fine for heels (would be so cute",pos
"I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it, i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.",pos
"I don't usually spend this much on a top but despite the high price, i really love the style. i like that it's made out of cotton and it can be worn down on the shoulders or left up. looks cute both ways. i ordered the xs which is usually my size. it fits perfectly. i imagine the s would have fit also. it hits just at the hips. i have a long torso so i would have liked it a bit longer, but it's not a deal breaker. my one splurge this summer.for reference 123 lbs, 5'5', 32 d.",pos
"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up.",pos
This top runs a tad big. it's beautiful in person and sooooo soft. definitely an retailer staple top. material and cut is great,pos
"This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue.",pos
This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great. i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest! it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions! however - looks super cute on those more on the flat-chested side!,neg
"I got he green color with gray accent stitching, looks awesome with gray tone leggings. super soft, definitely runs a little big (5'6"" 140 lbs i ordered the small) but not in an unflattering way.",pos
I'm 5'1 and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps that's because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! it's a fabulous sweater.,pos
Purchased this top in the store on sale. love the material. very soft and comfortable. love the black and white combination. i am petite so the top is a great length on me. i can see that if you are tall it might be to short.,pos
This is a beautiful dress! not too interested in yellow but needed it for a wedding this summer. i usually wear a large but returned it for a medium - the large armhole was a little too big. super comfortable and easy.,pos
"Nice feminine pattern with a thick fabric. it's great having pockets! the white is ivory. i'm a size 4, and the small fits nicely. it would be nice, if the pant length was a little longer. i have a 31"" inseam, and they end up being a couple of inches above my ankle, but that's just my preference. overall, very happy with this purchase.",pos
"Love this dress and so sorry it's not available in xxs. tried on today in store and the xs was very large in the upper body. i normally wear a 2-4, so this was surprising. if you happen to need probably size 6 or larger, you're in luck!",pos

This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.,pos

"I was so excited to get this in the mail, and so disappointed when i put it on. it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up, but i don't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams? i don't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not, but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area. returned it the next day.",neg
"I really love this piece because it's classic and the style transitions from day-to-night. the color caught my eye first, but once i tried it on, it was knotting the tie in front and seeing the elegant texture it created down each pant leg that sold me. i felt too comfortable to be stylish, but there i was multi-tasking my full-time passions in the retailer dressing room. no big deal. 

i am a tall, size 4/6 woman. for taller girls like me who a) intend to wear a small heel with the piece",pos
"I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale.",neg
This is such a beautiful dress.  but have to return for the reasons others have noted.  the chest does not fit well.,neg
"This dress looks better in person. the shape is pretty much straight, but fits nicely even if you are curvier. it doesn't show your imperfections. the type blue and white color is nice, but a bit see through on the bottom and the slip is a little short. came to about mid thigh for me so i would wear leggings underneath. i don't think a belt would look good with this because of the shape and if you have curves. very cool summer style.",pos
"I got this shirt in a medium, my normal retailer size and while the short fit, the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back, however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed, and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.",neg
"I tried this on in the store. all of the dresses in the store were misshapen and pulled long in the armholes (and i love all of my local retailer stores!) i don't think these should be hung on a hanger. the knit is too heavy for hanging. the hem on the dress i tried in the store was dirty from dragging on the floor. i went home and ordered it online with the 20% dress discount and free shipping. the dress i received was clean, unstretched in the armholes and not oddly short like some review",pos
Love this blouse and stunning color. the ruffles make it special and different!,pos
"Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.",neg
This dress looks amazing on. it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat. the black out-lined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress. my only issue is that the dress ran very small.,pos
"I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and haven't found one i really liked again...until now. great quality - just heavy enough but not too heavy, just stretchy enough but not too stretchy, great color/design. no complaints. i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal. i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect. it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago, which is a big endo",pos
"I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i",pos
"This top is really great for the summer. the fabric is light and gauzy so it's perfect for hot days. i don't like to wear a cami in the summer and this shirt does not require one when worn with a nude bra. i love the window pane pattern- and the light pink color is very flattering and subtle. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. with fairly broad shoulders, and wear either a small or medium. i ordered the medium in this shirt and found it a bit large so the small would have worked as well. i would say that your re",pos
These run so small!! i was dissapointed with having to return my pair. i'm hoping they are replenished back in stock so i can get the proper size.,pos
"I'm assuming the model showing the sweater is at least 5'9"", it is slightly cropped on her , but it certainly doesn't look super cropped. i'm 5'4"" and its super cropped on me. even with high waist jeans.
also, it is incredibly itchy. i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the cami.
too bad, its a cute design, just needs some tweaking.",neg
"I originally bought the white lace version of this dress, but it felt too ""bridey?"" then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version. i like that it is not all lace, with the pleated chiffon ""center."" the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow. it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps. well worth the price as this will f",pos
"Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.",neg
Unfortunately this one is going back. the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back.,neg
"The petites fit perfect!!  these are so comfortable, i will get much us out of them!",pos
"This shirt smelled so bad when i received it (and i am not at all sensitive to smells). is it from the dye? 
i tried it on anyway. it is shapeless and nothing special. at almost 80 bucks it is so over priced.",neg
"This sweater feels good and not itchy at all. i'm long waisted and the small hit right at my hip bone/top of my low-waisted jeans, so it's kinda on the shorter side. i liked it that way, bc it's not baggy at the bottom and is figure flattering. i tied the tie twice and thought it looked better. i have long arms and was excited the sleeves go down to the middle of my hands. it has little hole detailing down the middle, but not so much that you'd have to wear a shirt underneath.",pos
I am in love with this suit. i got the white floral. it's beautiful and classy. it feels like great quality too! i am going to get the black color too when it's back in stock. i am 5'9 and about 140lbs (32 dd) and i'm wearing a medium. i got both the small and medium and decided to keep the medium. it does have more fabric with the medium but the bigger size covers my chest and bigger bottom.,pos
"The sweater could be really pretty, but it is huge. i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me. it's too bad, because the stitching was beautiful, but this item is going back.",neg
"Love the rushed sleeves, and the flower pattern on the side. t shirt is, however, a little thin, hence a bit sheer. but i loved it nonetheless... i saw the loose fit and decided ot order a size down (xxs petite) ad it is so flattering. going to keep it as i don't think petite is going to make it to sale... i think it will look very cute with my denim pencil skirt, jeans or other pants for casual days!",pos
"These pants are my favorite! not only is the fit slimming and perfect, but i get compliments on the design every single time i wear them. i absolutely love these, well worth the money.",pos
"I like the edge of this dress and it balances my narrower hips well. i'm usually between 0p and 00p in retailer dresses and xxsp definitely fit better on my 5'1"" frame (armpits and knee-length where it should be)

love that it's machine washable and unusual. super soft and beautiful color even though i normally gravitate to cooler colors.

bring it on everleigh!",pos
"I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4"" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!",pos
"Beautiful pink top.  comfortable, love the color and print , style and sleeves.  good quality.  didn't have the issues with the placement of the bees over my breasts that other reviewers did. the bees were at the sides of my breasts. covered my butt for the most part in jeans. flattering cut.  i got an xs (5'2"", 34b, 115#).",pos
"I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past, and i've never been disappointed with quality, style, or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering than having that part stick out under fitted shirts. i got these in a 4, my usual size, and while they fit a little more snugly than my other size 4 charlie pants, there is enough stretch that they don't look or feel too tight. i also got these in the regular, r",pos
This shirt is so stunning. the photo does this shirt no justice. what you can't see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt. they run vertically.and are very subtle and seen only up close. so pretty. also the detail in the chest area is perfect. i love this shirt.,pos
"These pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings. i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties. i am 5'5"" with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle. they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green, red and gray. my ""go to"" pants this winter.",pos
The embroidery on this dress is beautiful in person. perfect dress for fall.,pos
"I do wish this came in a 30dd sizing, purchased he 32d and it fits, though the band is looser than desired. i am still keeping it. i love the back, will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear. recommend.",pos
"Love!!!! i was super hesitant to try this dress on, it didn't look great online or on the hanger. but it looked great on! it has a very boho/70s/vintage feel. i am curvy, and it looked fabulous.",pos
"Beautiful shorts. make you feel like a million dollars. love love love them!

the robe to match is also adorable.",pos
"I love elosie sleepwear, everything is well made and beautiful designs. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 4, the small fits great. i love the embroidery it is a nice touch, and the pink is a pretty contrast.",pos
Fits true to size. i am a size 4 and it fit perfectly. nice quality. fits like a glove.,pos
I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.,pos
"This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling. the material looks very nice and seems well made. it has a nice length to it, so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry. i'm a 36d and can't get the button to close properly, so i'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you. overall it will be a very versitile piece i'm excited to add to my wardrobe.",pos
"This is such a fun dress. the linen and cotton mixture is very unique and comfortable. for reference, i am 5'3"" and about 110 pounds. the regular xs hits me exactly the way it is shown in the photo. the color is a true oatmeal which is so nice for fall and even though i am fair with strawberry blonde hair, it doesn't wash me out. the sleeves are a little long but i rolled them once and it is perfect. i love this dress and it will look great with booties or boots for the fall.",pos
"Dress is made from a light-weight linen and is lined with a separate slip. high quality with nice details and tts. sleeves are average length. length of dress feels appropriate on my 5'8"" frame. hook-and-eye closure at chest area to keep buttons aligned is a quality detail. i think this is a lovely dress that can go from work to play.",pos
"They have some stretch, so if you are between sizes, order down. they are very long, which for me is a good thing!",pos
"This has great drape, length, the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints. i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck, so not sure if i will keep, though i don't seem to want to take it off! has a lightweight, boiled wool texture, contrasting print and design so cool!",pos
I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.,pos
"It's like a work of art, but sadly, not flattering on me. i absolutely loved the look, and even considered taking it to a tailor, but the material overall is very stiff. if you're teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips, you might love it. very sad to return this.",neg
"These jeans have been the best pair of jeans i have ever worn. you could practically sleep in them, they are so comfortable, brushed softness, and stretch easily. they hug your body in a flattering way, that these jeans are worth the money spent, as you'll have them for a while.",pos
"This dress is gorgeous in person, soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe, but well worth it.",pos
"Perfect fit. this dress is super flattering, the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on. the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage. the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty! the perfect spring to summer dress!",pos
"I purchased this skirt on a whim as an option for the up and coming hoiday party season and was plesantly surprised. it is very well made,a medium weight taffita material, and best of all, it has pockets! i just love the combination of colors in the skirt; navy blue, grey, and ecru stripe. i paired the skirt with a taylored white dress shirt and statement necklace for a classic look but also imagine it combined with a dressy t-shirt cut as well. buy it while you can!",pos
This top is so cute.  i love it and get tons of compliments on it.,pos
"Love this preppy sweater for fall. only detail i wasn't crazy about was the deep slits in the sides, it gapes a little oddly then around the pocket but not enough of a distraction for me to send it back.",pos
This looks beautiful and fits true-to-size. the material has enough weight so that it hangs well. this is a very form-fitting dress - i wouldn't recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style.,pos
"And this one proved to be no different. the short end of it; this dress is pretty much super thick, heavy linen with a rope like collar (the supposed embroidery you see), and there is no lining, but completely unnecessary pockets. i'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer (5'7 & a super fit 135 lbs) and knew enough to order an xs in this, however it still fit like a potato sack. even upon taking it out of the plastic bag, i knew it was going back. between the unrealistic pictures and lack",neg
"I love these jeans! they are super soft and just the right weight for year around. however, they do run large. i normally wear a size 27. i am 5'7 and weigh 127#'s. because the other reviewers mentioned the sizing issue, i ordered a size down=26. they were too large and i sent them back for an exchange. these are perfect. i get tons of compliments when i wear them...i would love to see coh make them in a true black.",pos
"I'm a big ag fan, so i was excited to receive these for my birthday. i really love everything about them, but boy were they long!! even with a 3 inch heeled boot i was stepping on the hem. i'm 5'7"", so i don't often have to get things hemmed, but that was a must with these jeans. i recommend these jeans, but unless you're 6 foot tall, plan on running them to the tailors.",pos
"I love the color of this skirt, and the fabric is wonderful. it was a bit longer than anticipated, but fit well.",pos
"Yes, this is a thinner bra, it's almost sheer when you hold it up to the light, but it fit perfectly (36d) and is seamless under even the thinnest tops. i love that its not padded, i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more, and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out! i can't speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and i'm wearing it for the first time today, but i'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel",pos
"Love this top, the lace detailing on it is gorgeous and fits tts. however, the length does run a bit short, not crop top short, but it is shorter than i expected, and i'm s short person.the color is listed as white and as pictured, it also looks white, but it's not. it's definitely an ivory color. i bought a white camisole to wear under it and when the top arrived, the tank didn't match the top.",pos
"For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight, it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length, super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet, but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.",pos
"I was worried the green might be on the shiny side, but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops, this top runs small, so order up a size. in most of retailer tops, i'm a small or medium, but in this, i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side, but got on sale, so all smiles here.",pos
So soft that i bought in 3 colors. i love wearing them. it is comfortable yet tailored. i highly recommend.,pos
"I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real life...not on a model, but tired it on in store and it looks great!  it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place.  just the right thickness, not too thin or thick.  i am 5'6"", 124lb, 34b and got the xs.  i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great.  i'm always either an xs or s with retailer tops. blue is definitely more steel. interesting piece! will not disappointed!",pos
"After reading the reviews, i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i'm 5' 3"" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i'm wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions.",pos
"Long, thin, tunic.  perfect over leggings, great for casual day but look pulled together.",pos
I had this on my wish list as soon as it came in. i just bought it last week and i'm so glad i did. i bought the purple print and it is really pretty. here in northern cal i can wear this almost year round. i am often right between sizes when it comes to deletta tops. this one is a little bit big i'm hoping that the extra room will help keep it cool during our 100 degree days.,pos
"I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8"" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.",neg
True to size so great fit from top to bottom. i am 5'5'' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low. it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area. it is very soft and comfortable. the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing.,pos
"I've been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughter's first birthday party. since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday, i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch. i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly. 

i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely",pos
"I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!
true to size and nice length.
the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.
nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.
very nice!",pos
"Soft, pretty design and perfect length. i'm 5'6"" and the m fit perfectly!'",pos
"I bought this top in a size 6 - i'm 5'5"" with a longer torso. i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up. the material is on the thicker side so it's a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape. i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more. i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic",pos
"Eyelash sweaters are all so soft and cuddly but this is the only one i've found what doesn't make me look like a bear. the shoulder cut-outs really help create a   flattering silhouette. i'm 36-30-40 the medium fits well, slightly loose so the sleeve below the cut out hangs slightly. highly recommend.",pos
Unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections.,neg
"The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.

dear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to",neg
"My v-shape figure (broad shoulder, narrow hips, waist not well defined) looked completely square in this. not flattering at all. perhaps better for other figures.",neg
"5'6 149lbs 34d normally size 6

i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif",pos
Morher jeans are my favourite! they are soft and fit great. make my saggy butt look good! they do stretch with wears but shrink again in the wash. they do shrink quite a bit so don't dry all the way! i recommend mother to all!,pos
"I thought this was a fun piece to have, but didn't realize how versatile it was until i got home and started mixing it with either casual shoes, or dressing it up with fancier accessories.
i love this jumpsuit!
it is well made, and the fabric is of a quality that lends itself to both casual and dressy",pos
"This sweater sold out fast at my local retailer store. you know that stuffed animal that you owned when you were a kid, and you would never let it go because it was so soft and snuggly? yeah, it is like that for me. it's a bit pilly but that's what sweaters do. size petite s fit me perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), hem falls 4 inches above my knees, sleeves fall right at my wrist, and it gives room for wearing a sweater or turtleneck under it. hood lays flat, horse print is so cute.",pos
"Yep, absolutely tickled to death with this top. light, airy, cotton poplin with personality plus. such an aesthetically pleasing piece! i haven't been this pleased with an article of clothing in some time! this blouse speaks to me...i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the size eight was a tad large-might have gotten a six but this is fine. it is very blousy on the bottom but when it speaks to me it says 'belt' or 'tuck' anyway! the neckline is just too much! it gives such personality to the piece. the open ne",pos
"I have been looking for an off-white vest and thought this one would be perfect, except it is going back. i am 5'9"" 150 lbs. medium is my normal top size, but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture. no buttons, so no way to close it. unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo. not worth the price.",neg
This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.,neg
"I noticed this top as i was going into the fitting room, and tried it on on impulse. i was pleasantly surprised with the fit and soft quality of the fabric, and even more impressed with the price. i usually like my tops very fitted, and found this one hung loose, but not boxy. i have been wearing it quite a bit, sometimes with a camisole underneath, and sometimes not. i bought the one with the flowers, and it is not see-through, and the light fabric is good for our warm heat. i bought my usual s",pos
This top is totally adorable. it's one of my favorite retailer tops this season. i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it. it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable.,pos
"Love this top! the lace pattern is gorgeous, and the detail at the neck and sleeves make it a little more casual. it's completely sheer, so you do need a white tank or shell underneath. the top is on the shorter side, but definitely not a crop. i'm 34c and 140b and got a small. fits great and pairs well with black pants and heeled booties.",pos
"Comfy easy dress. i bought the black version. fabric is so soft. i wear this around house, but don't hesitate to run out in it if needed. i bought medium so it was roomier and for length since i'm tall. small also fit, but was shorter than i wanted.",pos
"This is a gorgeous high quality blouse. the color is stunning in person; i don't have anything like this color in my wardrobe. i'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this blouse in a 16. i am busty but the top still fit well. i have large upper arms but the sleeves fit fine; i wish they were a bit looser but that is my personal preference and probably doesn't apply to most people. if you're very thin and not busty you might be able to size down, but i'm honestly just not sure. i'm happy to say",pos
"After reading the reviews, i was a little afraid of the fit before the dress arrived, having ordered it online. it is a darling dress. i am big busted (36d) and it fit just fine. also, it has an cute attached slip, so i didn't find it see through. the color is gorgeous, i chose the blue, and it will be perfect for summer. no problem at all with the armholes!",pos
"I really love this pant. ordered online and they fit well. they're cute, edgy with the fray at the bottom. corduroy material. awesome!",pos
"Great light-weight blouse for mild fall days. fabric is thin so not too warm, which is great for southern california fall. great color palate.",pos
"I love these pants. only wish they i was a little taller, i'm 5'4"" and the small is a little long for me.",pos
"I agree with another reviewer that these are not ankle jeans. however, even as regular jeans they fit great and the color is lovely and very versatile. i normally need to have my jeans hemmed but the length on these is perfect for my 5'4 frame",pos
"I have nothing but positive comments to say about this sweater. i'm 5'6, 130 pounds and i got a medium because my shoulders are a bit wide and my sweater fits me just as it does the model. it's not bulky but it is very warm, and the colors are out of this world! a very high quality and unusual piece that will be in my wardrobe for many years.",pos
This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!,pos
"I am 5' 5"" 150 lb and i usually wear a 10 or 12 in tops because i don't like clothing too tight on top. i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained. now i wish i could be more! please bring this back retailer!",pos
"This dress fit so oddly. i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly. the dress wasn't tight at my hips in either size, it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out. maybe i was too short? couldn't figure it out. 

the color and detailing are beautiful though! a little tight in the bust.",neg
"This is one of the best purchases i've ever made... i have had the black for over a year, and every time i wear it, i receive so many complements. i've dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt, or a fitted sweater, and paired it with flannel with a belt... i love it. i'm 6' ft and slender, and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee. i recently ordered the silver in a small (it's a little big in the waist- but nothing a corset belt can't help) for nye. love this dress!",pos
"I just purchased this at my local retailer..the online pix does not do it justice! so pretty & delicate..casual, comfortable fitting..hits right at the hips...",pos
"Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs, purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!",pos
"I was expecting a tee shirt, but the material is more of light sweater knit. in the end it wasn't the fabric that was the deal breaker...it was the fit. in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body. i also felt like the arms are too big as well. it's going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size. it's a shame because the embroidery really is lovely.",neg
I got this in the brown and absolutely love it. this is perfect for cool weather. i'm super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint,pos
I love this sweater coat;! it's so nice and fits well. would look great with jeans or a skirt. the collar is adorable! have already worn it and received compliments! i love retailer :)!!,pos
"Read other reviews, was worried about neckline being tight-- went with size of last dress i bought from retailer ---s---, perfect!! can't wait to wear this dress! got it in the black white polka dot-- plan to layer with capri legging!",pos
"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure.",neg
"I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my 5'5"", 112# frame.  my daughter loved it so she scored.  i ordered another one in xs, perfect though the sleeves run long! i have long arms.  can be dressy or casual.",pos
"I purchased this early in summer and have worn it a lot. you can dress it up or down, and since it's comfortable you will want to wear it a lot. i can wear it for everything from walking the dog to going out to dinner.. i bought 2 jumpsuits this summer and this is by far my favorite. the fit is flattering, fitted but not tight and the self-tie belt gives your waist definition so the overall look is hourglass. i am tall and i normally take an xs or s. i went with the s to ensure that it was long",pos

"Lovely! at 5'6"", 34a-28/29-36, the size small was a great fit. moss color is really quite grey. drapes beautifully and is an easy wear.",pos
"Other than the color (i got the rose color), which is great, i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough. i am 5'7"" and the sleeves come right to my wrists, if not just a tad longer onto my hands. it's also got some stretch to it so it doesn't make you feel to stiff as you wear it; you can move in it :) it's very comfortable and pretty.",pos
"I was really eager to receive this sweater, i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn't look new, it is mostly shapeless, it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col",neg
I had high hopes for this cute top but it runs very short. it is not as long as it appears on the model so it looked odd when i put it on. unfortunately it had to go back. bummer cuz it was very cute in the pix!,neg
I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play. highly recommend!!!,pos
"I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews. first off it runs really small. i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6) i couldn't even get the 6 on. i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy. i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off. other than the sizing and the fabric, it just wasn't flattering on me.",neg
"Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!",pos
"Love this brand, wish there was more available. always a perfect fit and excellent quality! great color, more rich and red than what you see in pic.",pos
I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it. the quality for the price is great. soft and comfortable. needs to be washed with care but is worth it,pos
"Fell in love with these instantly in the dressing room. it was more than i wanted to spend but i don't regret it. quality is great, denim is just the right thickness, i love the wash... will be wearing these a lot. just like my other pilcros!  i'm 5'8"" 125 lbs. size 28 fits perfect and the length is just right.",pos
"I bought these on a whim on mother's day when i was out shopping. i didn't try even try them on at the store. i got them home and couldn't believe how great they fit and how comfortable they were. the length is perfect for me. not too long or too short. they did stretch out a bit upon wearing them but i like the comfortable, relaxed look. i washed and dried them in the dryer. they came out perfect. i bought the coral color. will be buying more as it is hard to find shorts that work for me. i rec",pos
"I typically wear boring shorts. you know - khaki. i saw these in the store and had to try them on. true to size in the waist, not too short, and the leg fit was perfect (slim without being skin tight). the pattern is far from boring. i can't wait to wear them out.",pos
"Cute top, great for the inner maid marian fan. :) fun twist on t-shirt in regular size. also ordered the alexandria top in somewhat similar vein, but didn't care for that one at all. this one was cute and the fit is flattering. the other is boxy and boring to me. recommend this one.",pos
"Absolutely love! as others have mentioned, it's super comfy and the colors in the bottom definitely brighten up the sweater. the online brand says monogram, but the tag says sleeping on snow....weird.",pos
"I was afraid the twist at the front would be too bulky, but it adds a nice extra touch to an otherwise simple shirt. i got it in the blue and the color is beautiful. a basic piece with a little bit more; very happy",pos
"This is a great coat, very lightweight, but warm. the color is gorgeous. it is fitted at the waist with fullness below and a great length. i am writing this review to give a heads up about the sizing. by usual retailer sizing this runs small and short waisted. i am generally an retailer x small and i need to exchange this one for a small or maybe even a medium (if i want to wear much underneath it). as it is it fits too well, like a dress, not a coat and looks short waisted. in fact, when i tr",pos
"I really wanted to love this dress. i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors, and thought that the green color would be perfect. it is well made, but the fabric is lighter than expected. the biggest issues was the size. i am 5'7"" and typically a size ten. i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge. if you order this, i would say size down two sizes.",neg
Love this beautiful sweater! it's become one of my wardrobe staples. it's got a great cut and i love the design.,pos
"Great, stylish, swinging dress. softly draped fabric, so comfy to wear....very slimming and figure flattering.",pos
"After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors, i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin, so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!",pos
"I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it's beautifully made, the fabric is soft, comfortable, and free-moving, and overall it has a lovely vintage, romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week, and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well, especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie, but once tha",pos
"I usually do not buy dresses at full price but when i saw the teal version of this dress on the website i caved in and bought it. i had also tried the pink version of this dress in store. it's very cute and sweet but i don't think i can pull it off. the teal version is pretty accurate in color to the on screen image.

I love this dress. the colors are eye catching. if flows nicely.,pos
"Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i",pos
"I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it. the color is a beautiful rich red, which was a nice surprise. i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture. love the fabric - soft and appears to be good quality. the length is perfect - hit right at my knees (size small). the flow of the dress is great as well. the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes. the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck - almost like it was on",neg
"This dress has a very flattering cut for hourglass ladies. i am an 8/10 and got the medium. the sleeves are a little blousy, otherwise it is just about perfect. it will look great with boots or booties for fall. i will wear a thin tank with it to work because the neckline is a little deep.",pos
"I was a little hesitant to order this dress due to the cotton/polyester blend...not generally a fan of poly for summer. it is high quality though, very soft, lightweight and lays beautifully. it's not see through either, which seems like a rare find in clothing lately. the embroidery is very well done too, and i think it adds just the right touch of feminine, while not being overly ""precious"". it does run small by a whole size, which i've found to be typical of eva franco dresses. i am usually a",pos
Love this sweater! bought it in pink and grey and it looks great with jeans. great quality and true to size.,pos
"This is a gorgeous dress that while it runs quite small ( i normally take a s or xs ). i had to exchange it for a medium. i am 5 4"" and it falls below the knee which is how i like my dresses. it is a gorgeous pattern of color which could be worn for 3 seasons. i look forward to wearing it for many special occasions.",pos
"Lovelier in person! fit tts; i tried this on, walked away without it and returned to my store to purchase because i couldn't stop thinking about this dress. most definitely can be worn now, but will layer well through the winter - dress it up with heels and accessories or make it casual with a denim jacket and booties :) perfect floor length at 5'3.5"" in the regular 0; tiny bit of room in the bust for a 32b",pos
"Love this jumpsuit, i was rather apprehensive as i didn't think it would look as good on me as on the model but i am totally smitten with it. very flattering, especially if you have some bumps and rolls. i ordered in a medium (5.7 and 145 lbs and it fits perfectly. definitely recommend to order down. 
as i'm wearing it to yoga i wear a sports bra underneath, that also helps with the very deep and open back to cover up a bit more. highly recommend, the top hits in all the right spots to make one",pos
"I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5"" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are",pos
"I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up. however, the quality of the stitching is poor. where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides, the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone. i was bummed and am sending it back today.",neg
"Retailer has done it again! i love this top. i purchased it for our engagement photos. i am typically a small or medium, and decided to size down for this one. i purchased a small and it fit perfectly! its not near as long as it is in the photo, which pleased me. i did read about busty ladies having a problem with the fit - and i can definitely see how that would be an issue.",pos
"Love these shorts. i purchased them in the peach color. the color is perfect, the fit is perfect, they look great. highly recommend!",pos
"Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress, it felt very cheap. i didn't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned, it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning.",neg
I just love this dress.  took me ordering a number of sizes- petite and regular to find the best fit.  i might still have the top altered.  i received a lot of compliements.  work it with some black leather wedges for daytime/work.,pos
The top red is more like orange. was disappointed and returned it,neg
"I ordered the navy/green combo in xl and it's prettier in person. the fit matches the model so it's true to size for me. it is loose through the body. it's not slimming but not widening either. if you like how it looks on the model, that's how it should be when you try it on.

it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done, no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t",pos

"Finally, a white top that does not show every nook and cranny. this is a great fabric. many times white shirts are see thru and i won't buy them. this top is lightweight but has enough substance to cover everything. the online picture does not do it justice.
it can be worn with anything and is made very well. this one's a keeper for your closet and will be worn over and over all summer long.",pos
"I've been looking for an off the shoulder trend item and this one fits the bill perfectly. the denim is a nice color and weight, love, love the pockets! the neckline is not too frilly, the sleeves are fluttery but not over the top ruffled. i wore this dress to lunch with cute flat sandals and i must say it looked adorable! sad i didn't find this earlier in the summer, but will wear when i can. my only concern is that it will shrink in length, i'm hoping not. this one will def be taken to the dry",pos
I was looking for a new pair of pajama pants/around-the-house pants/occasional-quick-errand pants to replace a pair that i bought from retailer six years ago and i fell in love with the look of these.they are truly comfy and are flattering on. the lace adds a nice feminine touch that makes me feel pretty even on my laziest days. i'm hoping these will last me another six years.,pos
"Love this vest! i am not a huge vest person, and was worried about finding something to go with this, but i have been able to match it to so many cute thing. the pattern and quality are great. it runs big. if you're between sizes definitely go for the smaller size.",pos
"I really love this pair of fitted cargos. i'm 5""1, 103 pounds and bought a 25p since that what i take in most jeans at retailer. it is quite fitted like it shows on the model so some may prefer to size down for a comfortable fit. i bought the grey color and is a lovely neutral color. love these and may have to go for another color!",pos
"I""m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right.",pos
"Love this top! it hits at the top of the waist & is very flattering. the fabric is thicker than i thought it would be and had a deep texture. when i first took it out of the package, i thought it would be a ""send-back"" because it looked kind of square & shapeless. but once on, it took on a whole other look.",pos
"Lets discuss the neckline: it's fabulous!
furthermore, this sweater can go anywhere,
it's dress up, dress down.

feeling low? this girl will lift you up and take you to town.",pos

Completely versatile and absolutely perfect for days when my pea coat is too heavy. looks amazing with jeans or with slacks for work. i highly recommend this jacket!,pos
"I am a big pilcro fan. i have a really tough time finding pants that fit, are comfortable, and flattering all at once, and these didn't disappoint. the colors are beautiful and saturated, and just like they appear in the photos. i got my usual pilcro size, and the colors give me endless styling ideas. i also got them in the black and ivory print.",pos

"I'm trying to buy more basic, versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that. definitely runs large-- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p. i'm, 5'5"" and the petite falls where it does on the model. the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like. quality seems ok for the sale price.",pos
"I saw this top and immediately knew it was for me! i love it. and i disagree on it being one season too, i could see making this work all year, for sure. i love the green/gray color and it flows so beautifully, it's perfect! the back wasn't a problem for me, when wearing a normal bra i couldn't see my bra, maybe if this is a problem your bra is up too high on your back, i'm very petite and didn't have a problem with it. i bought a small, could have possibly used a xs but they didn't have it, but",pos
"This skirt is really cute and versatile, it can be dressed up or down. i paired it with a black chiffon top for a dressed up look and a denim button down for a casual look. the length is good, and the buckles allow it to be tightened, which is a plus if you have an athletic body.",pos
"This cape/poncho item is totally amazing. from the moment it whispered over my head as it slipped past my hair, i knew i had to have it. this piece is magical. it feels like you're wearing a blanket (the warmth factor), but the length is so perfect that it doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it make you look like a tank. the colors are amazingly saturated and the quality is so worth the price. the model is wearing it with light brown, but i tried it on over black leggings in the store and it works w",pos
"Beware. white is not white. white is more cream, off-white, light beige. i was really looking forward to these shorts but was immediately disappointed when i saw the color. they are cute, but not white. i bought them to wear with the nautical look tops for this summer, but unfortunately, creamy colored shorts don't do much for navy/white tops.also, the button is very difficult to open/close.otherwise they are ok.",neg

I bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen. this top does not disappoint. i bought my usual size xs and the length is good-slightly longer in back. i purchased the black and the grey. the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down. the quality seems good. great purchase!,pos

I am always looking for a shirt that's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt (running after a 1 year old i need comfort). i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple (which i think it said was blue for some reason). the material is nice and the cut is feminine.,pos
"I ordered the lavender version in xl. it fit me as shown on the model so i think it runs true to size. it is a little shorter than shown. it hits my waist & i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. it fits close through the arms & body but with a comfortable, stretchy material. a tank underneath is needed. i love the draping. it's very flattering. the color is more of a gray than purple. i took the chance on it when it was on sale and it's now a favorite. great neckline for wearing necklaces too.",pos
"This top is so gorgeous! the color, the embroidery, the neckline, are all perfect. this can be worn casually with jeans or dressed up for a special occasion. i wore this to a thanksgiving part, but also to take final exams in (because it is comfy too!). this piece definitely runs small. i ordered a large despite being a medium in almost everything else at retailer and the fit is perfect.",pos
"I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.",pos

"I bought this at the retailer store the other day and i wore it to work and i received so many complements. it has the perfect amount of swing and hides your middle without looking frumpy. i got the blue color and wore it with skinny jeans and ankle boots. the red is really more of a bight pink color, not a rich red as pictured. i wish it came in more colors and patterns...maybe green or purple? it does run big, i usually take a large, but a medium was perfect.",pos
"This is a simple shirt, but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer! i'm ordering one in the blue and white as well... i know this is going to be a fave. i love supima cotton, and though i adore retailer, i do wish they'd carry more of the supima rather than the non-organic fabrics. so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy, because i prefer the feel of silk, linen and cotton. thanks for this one, retailer!",pos
I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly. this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didn't. i'm 5'4 and i ordered a petite small. i was swimming in it. the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants. i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me.,neg
"Purchased this in the burnt orange color - very nice!
will be lightweight for our hot, humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up front.

looking forward to snagging a nice derby style hat to match!",pos
"I am 5'3, curvy and wear a size 12 and these pants look amazing! often i struggle with wide keg pants bc they make me look short and plump, however, the material is buttery soft and hang in an elegant way and most important they are quite flattering. even if you don't think culottes will work for your body type- i suggest you give these a try.",pos

I bought this dress in a medium petite. i'm 5'2 and 140#. it fit great and made my waist look really tiny. i cannot wait the dress with heels or else you would see the entire shoe. it works perfect with flat sandals. i've received tons of compliments! you can also wear a normal bra with the dress. love it!,pos
"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all, it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us",neg

"This dress hits all of the high notes for me. it is crisp, elegant, and it looks like something a european coutour designer would create. i am so glad i have this dress in my wrardrobe. it hits me just above the knee which is super flattering. wear this to a fancy party when you want to look feminine and classy. it is a dress that will serve you for a lifetime.",pos
"I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something, they do not hang or move well on the body. also, they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly, these are going back.",neg
"I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top, and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.
wrong.
the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large, same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.
the sweater is high quality, and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.",neg

this cape is my favorite purchase in a long time! the juxtaposition of the black and red body against the grey faux fur collar is stunning! it has brass detail snaps up and down both sides as well as at the generous pockets at natural length on both sides. it is very well made of good quality materials, as all tracey reese pieces have been in my experience.

"The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress. 
the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch, i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.

this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines",pos
I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse! material is very comfortable and the fit is great!,pos

"Just got this dress in the orange print and i can't begin to say how much i love it!! looks even better in person than online and it's super flattering. love the neckline, armholes are perfect and show off toned arms and shoulders ( this is the kind of dress that makes time spent at the gym worthwhile!). the fabric is light and stretchy and the pockets are an extra bonus.
i would say fit is tts but keep in mind that it's very loose at the bottom so i would go down in size if you want a less loo",pos
"Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer",pos
"These are great pants! i sized up from my typical size 28 because i found the rise to be a little low for me. i tend to like my pants a little higher on my waist. the sa said these ran a little smaller for most. when i got home, i put them up to my size 28's and they were the same.

This is my second pair of pilcro chinos. their pants and shorts are so soft--even those who love to run around pantless might relent. this brand tends to run a bit large so if you like your pants form fitting you may want to size down.,pos
"Love this dress! really nice quality, timeless design, not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering! this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny. i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look, but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose. the body size and length does run large, so size down on this one. now i understand why the petites were all sold out? whatever, modes",pos
"The label says 100% linen, but it's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen. it's not a scratchy linen at all. it's a very very fine knit, but the top is not sheer. i do not think you need a cami under it. 

i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape, but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much, i just bought another one in mauve.",pos
I bought this for my mom's birthday and she loves it. fits true to size and flattering for all busts. mom went up a size to be able to put a sweater underneath but she received lots of compliments at a recent function she wore this to. great lines.,pos

Stylish or comfy - often the choice when looking for casual but not with this top! it's comfy and cozy and stylish to boot. the sleeves are fun and create a nice line of interest. you can pair this with jeans for a casual day or dress it up with slacks and heels and be comfy either way.,pos
"I purchased this in the blue motif.  i am 5'4, 118 pounds and got an xs. i love everything about this tee. it looks great with jeans and i love it with my white denim shorts! i haven't worn it off the shoulder yet.  i think it looks great as a regular tee. i get compliments whenever i wear it.  so happy with this purchase!",pos
"This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size, but the material is slinky and felt cheap. the stitching was also poor quality. i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch, try on and return in store...this went back.",neg
"This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.",neg
"The lace and fit were good. but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowy-ish the dress is. it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something. and i hated the ""outside"" middle material, hated it. it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace. maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece.",neg
I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.,pos
Very pretty & shimmery. suitable for slightly dressier occasions. comfortable fit.,pos
I love this dress. even more beautiful in person ??,pos
"Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short (i'm 5'5""), it also is too big! the empire waist has no shape or flatter, the sleeves are huge, the neckline was falling off my shoulder, i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong.   the print is very fun and my guess is that's what is attracting everyone to it.  it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me.  back it goes.",neg
Yay for the return of shirts that show your form but don't reveal the flaws! i bought this in cream which only seems to be in stores right now. the stripes on the cream version are vibrant and beautiful. the weight of the top is very nice and really hugs your shape. i did think it ran a tad small. i bought the large but also could have worn the medium.,pos
"I was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model. but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews. well i must say, i'm so glad i did! i really love the shape of this dress. i'm heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist. the dress is very well made. if you order the right size for you, the slip dress will stay in place. i'm going to style it with high black platform heels, but i also like it with boots as",pos
"My favorite colors are purple and green, so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves, i was was blown away. i was disappointed by the bottom of it, just huge, flowy, green fabric with no design on it whatsoever. i went with my first impression and bought it, but now that i'm trying it on in the house, i'm still bothered by the throw-away bottom of this blouse. i'm thinking this is just another retailer maternity t",neg

the cut is loose and flattering. the different patterns are also very fun. colors are gorgeous, nice details. the buttons are sturdy. 
i tried on both 0p and 00p - not much difference in the 2 (i would go petite if you are on the short side). the 00p was just a bit snugger near the =chest, but didn't gape. the waist is definitely meant to be looser, so don't expect a fitted dress. length was slightly above the knee",pos
"The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it's huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,",pos

"This is a great light, free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area, but if you are small busted, you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!",pos

"I got this in blue and i love it! it skims your curves without being clingy, and it is very comfortable. i was hesitant to buy this, but it's surprisingly flattering! it will be perfect with heels for early fall, then worn with a long sleeve shirt and boots when the temperatures dip. my only caution is that it is shorter than it appears in this photo. it falls well above my knees, and i am shorter than the model. regardless, i am thrilled with my purchase!",pos
Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse,neg
"Gosh, this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing, but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details, fit is comfortable yet elegant, nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath, but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).",pos
"Hi, this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. very feminine. it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric. love it.",pos
"This trench coat solves my eternal problem with trench coats - which is that when i see one on a model in an ad they look effortless and casual, but then when i try one on it looks rigid and stuffy somehow. this trench coat drapes beautifully. that said, it's not the same kind of fabric as a traditional trench coat so it probably isn't water resistant. i'm fine with that, it looks amazing.",pos
"I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture. much shorter than that. and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice, the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price...",neg
"This dress definitely runs large, so i ordered it through my local store, in order to get a size that would fit. i ordered one size down, but could have gone down 2. i love the embroidered design. i just wore the dress to a slovak festival, yesterday, and it fit right in :-) very comfortable, and fun to wear.",pos
"This dress is absolutely fantastic. beautiful, high-quality, and fits like a glove. even better than i could have imagined.",pos
"This shirt is perfect for me. i have very small shoulders, but i am pear shaped. so the flare on the bottom is welcomed for my body type. i bought 2 colors. i have a similar shirt from retailer a few years ago that was multicolor which i wear all the time, so i am thankful they have repeated this design. also i did get this on sale which is a more realistic price for the quality of this shirt.",pos
"I'm 5'-4"", 130lbs with a 32f chest. this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu. i can't imagine this looking good on anyone who isn't 7' tall. also, the straight across, rather high neck line wasn't flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge. the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap. it wasn't see through but it had the feel of a nightgown, not a hundred dollar dress.",neg
"Originally ordered a large but it was huge. the medium fit perfectly. i'm 165lbs, 5'7"". lovely material and interesting side details. the sides do come up quite high but a camo or tank underneath does the trick. lots of compliments!!",pos
"I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long. i'm only 5'1"", so it goes to above my ankles. it's like a midi dress on me, but i really love it! it is so flattering. there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you don't want to show. it's the usual bailey 44 great quality. so slimming! hugs the booty in the right way! definitely worth the money!",pos
"I just received this dress in petite extra small. for reference, i am 5""7 and 118 pounds. to answer the previous reviewer's question, the regular size of this dress runs long. if you want it to look like the one in the video, then order it in petite. i personally love the style and the material. however, the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it.",pos
"Love love this! i was hesitant to buy this at first - the reviews made it seem so big and i wasn't sure if it was my kind of outfit. but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find! the xs was a typical retailer size for me, so the size was good in this, too. the color is fabulous and the fit is great. the rise is slightly short, but not a problem. i can't wait to where it for my next great event. i wish i could buy it in the black, too.",pos
"This top is so cute on. would look great on anyone as the style, quality, and color is incredible. highly recommend, even at this price. you won't regret it.",pos
"Absolutely stunning top! love! what a great buy on sale! i wear a medium/large and purchased the size 12...fits perfect! beware that the bottom has somewhat of a flair! the material is light so i would say this top is something to be worn transitioning between seasons, late summer to fall!",pos
"I'm 5'0 125 lbs and the petite small fits perfectly. i love the length of the shorts, not too short and not frumpy either. the waist has a hidden band so it hugs you in a good way and makes the top half slightly blousy, so it's forgiving. will go great with gray booties, black wedges or sandals.",pos
"I love this dress. like another reviewer said, it's the perfect teacher dress. i wore it on the first day of school. it's comfortable and flattering and super cute. i received lots of compliments.",pos
Love the quality and fit! it runs small so i got one size bigger.,pos
I am 5'4 and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 14 which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in,pos
"I absolutely love slips, and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans, i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses, and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough",pos
"As soon as i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. i just tried it on and it is beautiful. i feel gorgeous and glamorous! i can't wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attention.

the silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect. the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the look.

i am 5'0"", 110, and i purchased the small petite. it's slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs / puckers out so i'm going to",pos
Love this skirt. very comfy. looks like it's very expensive material but feels comfortable.,pos
"Great fit, wonderfully made, and priced just right.",pos
"Love everything about this. the color is gorgeous - great fall addition to any wardrobe. the tassels are cool - usually don't like things like that.

i wear a small or medium in retailer, usually small, and i purchased the small.",pos
"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!",pos
"I am 5' 3 3/4"" tall, and usually wear medium in retailer tops. i love this top. purchased same style in sleeveless this past summer and was hoping the style would return, as i was complimented every single time i wore my summer version! i do wear a cami underneath. i agree that in the picture the yoke doesn't seem pink, however i like it even better with the more pink hue as it gives an even more eye catching piece the pizzaz i look forward to seeing in retailer offers! i love retailerpo",pos
Fun pattern which goes with just about anything. cool for summer.  very comfortable.  fitted style but true to size.,pos
"This blouse is sumptuous! the fabric is soooo soft, embroidery beautiful, fit flattering. sadly i returned it due to the color. i mostly shop on-line due to time restriction, and the picture looks to be a winter white to me. it is a light yellow color, most pleasing with the cobalt embroidery. alas, any shade of yellow makes my skin look jaundice - so back it had to go.",pos
"I love this sweater, it is well-made, the colors are great, adn the feel is very soft. i just love troubadour, never knew of it before this season,but already own a few pirces.
i tried on the blue version, fits true to size, i don't hink i need the petite. the nexl ;ine was more falttering than the pcture shows. i love hte sleeves too. i think overall the shirt is a bit of flared out style, which i love.",pos
"This shirt is so cute! i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be- as i'm not one for frills- but the sleeves sit nicely. also, i am between a size small and medium, i got the small and it definitely is flowy. runs big, so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down. i got the red and it's a perfect autumn / winter color. the cut outs are not too showy- so it's not revealing for us gals who are a little more belly-conscious. it's the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a",pos
I bought this tunic for my mom as a birthday gift. it is very good quality and will look cute for fall too.,pos
Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!,pos
"I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8, my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.",pos
"I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.",neg
"This dress is fun and flattering. love the pieced denim look and the a-line style. unlike other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size for my pear-shaped figure. the length is long enough to wear anywhere, and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures.",pos
"I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!",pos
I feel in love when i tried it on! i'm 5'2 an usually have to hem long dresses - but this on fits perfectly. it's full length on me -it's shorter on the model but i think it looks better full length. and it's a gorgeous burgundy. soft and comfortable. can't wait to wear it!,pos
"Absolutely love the design, fabric, and fit of this dress! a perfect dress for many occasions, one of the many reasons i love this company! excellent customer service, employees, and of course adorable clothing. 10/10 would recommend buying this dress! and to all the taller girls, i am 5'11"" and 170lbs and this dress is still a good length! no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear.",pos
The dress is a great buy especially since it was on sale. it fits like his other dresses flattering as i don't have a big bust and have a bit of extra skin from pregnancies but with this dress i feel amazing. get a ton of compliments when i wear it!,pos
I have many maeve shirts and this one does not disappoint. i purchased the blue and love it. i do agree with other reviews though that the chest is a little tight while the rest of the fit is small.,pos
"I really love this top. normally i would not go for a lot of narrow stripes like this because i would think it is too busy, but this one is certainly the exception. both colors are fantastic and i think the design is alluring-not busy. i like that it buttons down which offers a lot of flexibility to display necklaces or have completely up to complete change the look. one of the things i absolutely love about this is that it has long sleeves. i think it is rare these days to find something that i",pos
"I purchased this in the ivory color in store and liked it so much i ordered the plum color on-line. i am almost always an xl, but this fit better in the l size. it's very soft and comfy and i love the swingy style. will be wearing it a lot!",pos
"I love these pants. they are very flattering and comfy, and look like real leather. they are also machine washable which is great. i've worn mine 5 times already.",pos
"Gals, if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry, it will). between the poor fit and the polyester, i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.",neg
"Like most of the other reviewers, i agree this skirt runs quite small. i had to size up 2 sizes. the waist is quite small (but there are parts that are elasticized (nicely hidden)) and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape. i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie. i think it will work nicely year round, too.",pos
"This simple dress will turn heads. it fits to the body, hugging just in the right spots. i love this dress! it is soft and feels amazing on. you can adjust the tie in the front. i purchased the copper color, but i have to say that is much more brown to me than copper. a dark brown. i still think the dress is adorable. looks cute with booties or knee high boots. winner!",pos
"Love the color, fit and feel of these jeans.  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i didn't have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party.  they didn't bag out after the first wearing and are true to size.  i got a 27p (5'2"", 115#).  the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle.  the rise wasn't too low for me.  highly recommend!",pos
The colors on this top are very bright & cheery. i love wearing this top. i get a lot of complements on the combination of the pastel colors. it reminds me of a warm summer day. i wear a pink tank under neath and it really brings out the pink colors of the top.,pos
The only strange thing is the size. i used to wear size s (117bl) but this time the small is way too big. i still keep it and put a belt on. it is a very very pretty dress. i used to buy sale from antheropologie. but can not wait this time. i am very impressed by the design. can not praise more!,pos
"I got this shirt in an xxsp, and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering, although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much, but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right, so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt.",pos
"Being somewhat on the 'fluffy' side, the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer. i am between a size 14 and a 16 and the 14 fits perfectly. light and airy a very nice, simple embroidery in contrasting color. very chic in an effortless way. the armholes are just right--not too big! the color is definitely a creamy ivory. worth the cost because i don't think it will be available for too long.",pos
"I ordered the xxs, i think retailer has gone on the bigger size again and i went from small to xs to xxs... so true to size in that sense. i love the color (nude), and it is pretty soft and comfortable. the cut is flattering, the cowl neck is pretty, the sleeves are shorter, and the hem is wider (aka swing). this would look totally adorable with my flare or wide leg jeans. i think ti would look nice too with skinnies, if you have leaner legs.

(for reference, 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs)",pos
"Bought this in the silvery grey color in the store yesterday, and i have to say the photos don't do this top justice. it hangs beautifully, is nicely lined, and is well made. i will leave the ties hanging rather than tied. it isn't too long, but long enough and has a nice swing. i'm short waisted and large breasted and this top is super flattering on me!",pos
I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all,neg
"I'm super happy with this dress! it's extremely well made, very light and comfortable and the shoulder cutouts are tastefully done. this dress is cotton but doesn't look cheap or too casual; it's one of those rare finds that will look great dressed up or down. this will absolutely work across seasons, with leggings and boots/booties or bare legs and sandals when spring comes around. i do feel like it runs a little large, but again it's 100% cotton so i know there will be some shrinking when wash",pos
"I love how comfortable this dress is, it does run a little large so i would order a size down. i'm 5'3"" and around 125lbs and had to exchange the xsp for an xxsp.",pos
"Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors aren't look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.",pos
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim thinking it be a great throwback to the 70s. it is actually very flattering on, with the lines running down vertical, giving a slimming look to any figure. it is also very soft and comfortable on, and has nice, large pockets on the sides. it doesn't look dated at all once on, and i'm sure will get plenty of use as the weather warms up. for reference, i'm 5'7"" tall, and weigh close to 130 lbs., and found the small fit well. the only drawback was the pice, but i",pos
This dress is timeless. so cute on and fits easily. i like that it has long sleeves yet it is a light fabric. comfortable and stylish. that is for me! i am taking it this weekend to nyc for a trip. i think i will fit right in!,pos
"These are a beautiful color, but run large. i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me. they are very low rise so i don't think i'll be trying the smaller size, can't even imagine them being lower. also, they are cropped, that's hard to tell in the picture.",neg

"I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package; the size 8 was perfect for me (usual medium, size 8, short-waisted, 34f)! this blouse is truly a find: luxurious linen in a unique, appealing design, excellent fit (the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right, the v-neck is not too deep (thankfully bra friendly!), the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme, and finally, admirable craftsmanship. i highly recommend! this will feel di",pos
"Love these pants! i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. could even wear a little heel. the fold over waist is so comfy, they feel like pajamas but look very classy. i bought the navy and silver (more of a khaki color) on sale for a great deal. the washing instructions say line dry but i threw them in the dryer on low and they came out fine. just need to remove and hang quickly for less wrinkles.",pos
"Absolutely adore this dress. details, fabric and deep pockets. here is the caveat at least for me. i am a typical size 6 and ordered the dress in a size 8 for a little looser, casual fit. the 8 is so small i can barely place over my shoulders and cannot button. i have reordered a size 12 and 14. perhaps the dress i received is not tagged properly. so disappointed as the item is on backorder.",pos
"Shirtdresses are a warm weather favorite for me, and this one will surely make its way into my regular rotation. the outer cotton eyelet is intricate and beautiful. the color, cornflower blue, is endlessly flattering for many complexions. the cut is classic with the twist of the handkerchief hemline, and the length is work appropriate. per a previous reviewer, i sized up to ensure a fit across the bust and am glad i did. overall, the fit is not totally perfect on me, but it's still great and gar",pos
I love the unique design and the fit. they are very flattering. they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great.,pos
"Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses.",pos

"I found this dress delightful! i have worn it numerous times and though quite long (for some girls) fits me well. my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast. the fabric is light and comfortable, i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing. i am 5'9"", 155 lbs and a 34a cup; i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well.",pos
"Like another reviewer, i initially passed by this sweater and thought nothing of it until i noticed it on display... super cute and ultra comfy... the kind of sweater that just beckons to be warn in the fall. i purchased this in the olive color and just love it. very cute and flattering for a poncho-type sweater. i do think it runs a bit large so i sized down for the perfect fit. i highly recommend this item!",pos
This top is very cute and is made out of soft material that isn't clingy at all. and you don't have to be stick thin for it to look good. i don't like to show my arms normally but this top is very flattering all around. i love it!,pos
"This top also caught my eye in my local store, and being a devoted deletta lover, i had to buy. it is a straight, slim fit, so i bought a medium, instead of my usual small, to glide over my curvy lower half. it's thin, finely woven knit, with two cute little buttons at the top of the side slit; the cut and longer length in the back is very flattering. i bought the heathered black and have worn with my black pilcro leggings; it's a great top to wear over leggings or skinny jeans; no belts with th",pos
I absolutely love this sweater....it is perfect for fall,pos
I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.,pos
"I adore maeve tops, and this is no exception. i'm small on top (32a), ordered my usual maeve size 0. i'm 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered regular (not petite) because the front of this blouse is already short. fits appropriarely, but take note it is much more blousy than it appears in the photo. you have to try it on, either you'll love it or hate it. i do love it's slightly oversized blousy fit, so i was not hesitant to put it in the dryer on low for about 15-20 minutes. well... it shrunk up like nothing",pos

This will be my favorite fall acquisition! looks better in person. very flattering. does run large. love the combo of tan and grey.,pos
This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.,pos
Love this dress and so does my boyfriend. took my usual size 2 and it's a little snug but the 4 would have been too big.,pos
I normally don't care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits. i got my usual medium and it fits well. it has a nice drape and is not see through.,pos
"I wore this dress to an outdoor farm wedding and it was perfect. it runs small (i'm 5'5"" 125lbs with 34c bust) and i got a size 6. i tried on blue and pink, both were great but the blue won me over. it wrinkles easily so i had to use an iron on low to medium beforehand. will wear many more times!",pos

"Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.",neg
"This dress is crazy flattering and extremely versatile. i wish it came in other colors...i would scoop them all up. great price (plus used by birthday 15% off coupon). the fabric is light weight...but not flimsy. plus it's lined with a satin fabric so the dress won't stick to you. i'm 5"" 113 and i ordered the petite x-small and it is perfect. i can see it with fun sneakers (like the picture) or with some fun jewelry and high wedges for going out. thinking of buying a 2nd one as back up...it's th",pos

"I purchased the blue s (140lbs, 5'8"", 34b) and this was very large and boxy on me. not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price. the blue color is very pretty in person--darker and slightly marled. however, although this sweater is certainly cashmere (and very soft because of it), it is very thin--to the point that i consider this a ""top"" rather than a ""sweater."" the silk panel in back is pretty but, again, thin and unlined. i think that, even on sale, this is ov",neg

I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans. this is exactly what i was looking for. the color is better than the pic to me. the style is flattering.. the size is just right. can't wait to wear it. i strongly recommend it.,pos
"This is a great casual skirt, i ordered the 0p or xs petite and it fit perfectly. both colors are nice, i don't think i could choose though i do have a taupe skirt, so leaning towards the slate color. the fit is also flattering, waist is snug, but not tight. the fabric is soft, could wear in the fall or even winter with tights. i recommend...

"I never would have thought to choose this, but an retailer associate suggested the black sweater as a topper while i was trying on the camellia dropwaist dress, and it made a sale, i bought them both! the sweater, while not decked with beads or embroidery, adds an incredible definition to any outfit that is overly flowy. i would say the photo above showing the grey sweater says it all. usually a size 6 in retailer dresses, the small fit well. i appreciate the cotton fiber content, as well as the ver",pos

These jeans are my favorite skinny jeans. they are expensive but so worth it. i had nordstrom reinforce holes with patches so they still look distressed but won't rip further. i wear these at least once a week.,pos

"These pants fit great, are soft, comfy, and flattering. i'm 5'7"" and the length is perfect in a medium. they wash well.",pos
Love this tunic. i bought it in black and wore it with skinny jeans and flat black boots and received many compliments. can be dressed up for work or worn with distressed jeans on the weekend.,pos
The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,neg

"I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns. the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size. the style allows you to put on a t-shirt, sweater, cardigan + t, whatever, and look completely put together. i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them.",pos
"I own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra. i tried to wear thong panties but they just didn't work for me. thankfully, natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable. they also receive rave reviews from my husband. : )",pos

I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.,pos
"I debating this dress for a long time. i just was hesitant because it is very form fitting. i think this dress runs true to size. after reading other reviews, i was debating ordering a 6 (i'm normally an 8). and i am glad i went with the 8. it is form fitting. the material is just absolutely beautiful and not stiff. it is a bit thicker, which will be nice in the fall. colors are true to the pictures shown and length falls as shown on model.",pos

"Frustrated that retailer tops have been so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and it hits at the top of my pants. makes me look a bit boxy. so disappointing because i wanted it for family photos. otherwise the design is gorgeous. having a hard time returning it but for the price point, it probably has to go back :(",pos

"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1'', 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite. 

first of all, when i button this, there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow, yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all, making the gaping even worse.

Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.,pos

it looks and feels like really good quality.",pos
"I saw this online and loved it. i wanted to wait for a sale and a promotion, but this tee-shirt sold out in the color holly. completely sold out but for petite. i bought a s and a m. the small works. it is comfortable. it can be dressy or very casual. i bought the white and the carbon. it is a different style on a tee. if you notice the front neck and the bottom of the back you will see what i mean. i recommend this highly. i can't imagine anyone not liking it.",pos
"I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but the design really spoke to me. i've been waiting for an off the shoulder piece that i love, and this was it. great, light fabric and beautiful design. i love it. worth every penny. can be worn on or off the shoulder like pictured.",pos
Can't wait to wear this out for the holidays! very comfortable and versatile - looks great with the vegan leather moto pilcro pants or any black skinny jeans for a more dressed up look -- i was originally going to pair with dark gray pilcro but the black moto with black heels looked really great in the store dressing room. beading is gorgeous and well done. velvet trim makes it luxe in my opinion. love that you don't need to pile on anything else to look polished -- top speaks volumes in and of,pos
Very flattering on. fitted on top with a loose swingy bottom. like most retailer tops it does run a little big. i would size down if between sizes. the material does seem a little fragile so i'm not sure how it will hold up. i like the look/fit enough that i may get a 2nd color.,pos
"This is a beautiful top, the fit is very flattering. i'm tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow. i wear it on the weekends and to work...very versatile. i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry, it's the same size and no fading..not sure about the others below with shrinkage issues. highly recommend it!",pos
"I love this skirt. maybe i love wrap skirts in general, but many miss the mark. this one is just right. it does not have elastic waist band which always makes me look frumpy, instead it is a side zip and allows for the tummy to stay flat as well as the pleats. the embroidery is just enough and you may not be able to see the design of black on black in the fabric which makes the skirt. i usually wear a size 6 but the 8 fit just right, so you may want to size up.",pos
"I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color, yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha",pos
"Fabulous dress. i was looking for that one dress that i could spend a little money on and wear to a variety of events, mostly weddings. i received tons of compliments and was very comfortable in it. the hooks on the front of the dress to start to unhook themselves if you don't really clamp down on them, but that was the only issue. i don't know how flattering this would be on shorter ladies, only because it ends right around your knees.",pos
"The knit is thin.  it's more for a chilly spring or warm fall day.  but, it's not see-through, although a bit light weight.

the style if figure-flattering and fits tts.  i am short and i found the sleeves, length perfect.  so if you are tall, you ""might"" find this shorter in the arms or body on you.

i bought the purple and it's a great color.  love it!",pos
Perfection. soft. lived in feel and look without holes or rips. and for someone who is 5 ft 2 in. they are just the right length if i don't feel like cuffing the bottom. fit tts.,pos
Love love love. fits great. super comfortable and looks both casual and dressy at the same time. i could wear this every single day.,pos
"I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact, two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however, as we were looking at the items, we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality, as the previous reviewer noted. therefore, none of us purchased the pants.

the staff at the store were very helpful",neg

This sweater coat is so cute!! i agree with the other reviews it does run a little big. i always wear s tops from retailer....was a little hesitant to order this in a s since i would be wearing it over things....so glad i did the small is perfect so i would say it runs a little large. i do think it is is a little over priced but i did get it at 20% off and it was a treat for myself!,pos

"I love the colors and style of this poncho, however, the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy, i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also, unfortunately, the fabric is not woven tightly, so the poncho does not keep you warm, the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top, the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.",neg

"I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me, but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built",pos
"I was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print. the popsicle print on this dress is really, truly adorable. unfortunately, the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming: i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest (and i'm only a 32b, ladies, so be warned!) at the same time, the arm holes were huge, i mean massively big. i think if you have a swimmer's body this might work. otherwise, you'll for sure nee",neg

Well made gorgeous skirt that can be worn with heels and lace top or tee shirt and big jewelry. true to size. i am a 2/4 and the extra small was great. poofs out a bit but not like you're a fairy. i would say the blue (which i ordered) is more of a seafoam / mint green which is also lovely and spring time.,pos

"I have been looking for a black dress for a few events i have coming up this winter and have not been able to find anything suitable! i have tried a few things from free people but being 5'8"", everything there is just too short for these particular events. when i saw this dress, i had to have it! it has the same feel as some of the free people dresses but the length is so much better! the dress itself is sheer and not intended for extended outdoor wear, but really beautiful on. dress up with som",pos
"I originally got these in a 29 petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag (i'm usually a 6/8).. and within an hour of wearing them (to retailer, actually), the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous; i've never had jeans do this. the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd. i exchanged for a 28p at her suggestion, and i just hate them. i'd say the smaller size seems every so slightly small, but nothing major - but the waist actually folds over a",neg
"I was very patient with this dress. i was waiting almost forever till this dress gets on sale. when i tried my usual 6 size it was way too tight but i could zip it. ( i am 5'6'' 145 lbs). the dress covers my knees and it's a perfect length, so when i sit it does not show too much of my length so it's a work friendly. it has side pockets, which can be very comfortable as well. the cut is great, it's a line,the thickness of material makes belly look great (in case if you care). i also like color a",pos
"I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it... unfortunately it wasn't at all as expected in person.

as the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material, which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store. the neck was extremely tight; a problem i've never encountered with any retailer dress. additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line, which protruded in an unflattering way. the pocket is not at all not",neg
"I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender. the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem. but it is somewhat boxy and flowy, which didn't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise.",pos
"I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o",neg
"Love the look of this poncho - which is not as large/billowy as i thought it would be. i tried it on as a whim in the store and fell in love. the colors are more beige than gray, for those of you with pale/blue underdone complexions. it may wash you out. love the orange knit running through to give it a little pop. i'm 5'9""/132 pounds, and the hem was a bit cropped on me. may want to consider a tank top or t-shirt underneath.",pos
"I was a little  hesitant to order it.  i am glad i did, it is a great top.",pos
"I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely, and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy, embroidered material, very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color, but it doesn't show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing, and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly, although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1"", 130 #, 3",pos
This is a great layering tank that is super comfy! the sale price is a bargain!,pos
"I love it! it's cute and short and shows off my legs. the material is thick and great quality, so great for the fall. the color is great for florida!!! brightness year round. it's fits perfectly. i purchased a 14 and it fits like a glove. i am going to wear with my booties and a jacket like the model. hey it works!!!",pos
"The stitched v-neck tunic is a very charming piece to your wardrobe. it is soft and feminine, and has added charm with the fringed bottom.
it is a comfortable piece that looks great with leggings or skinny/straight jeans. 
it is a loose fitting design, so it is a bit large. opt for a smaller size if you prefer a closer fit to your curves.",pos
"The metal detail @ the shoulders is the perfect touch to an otherwise ordinary tee. 
regarding sizing. i am 5' 4"", 36dd and i usually have to buy l in tops and make alterations. after reading the other reviews i ordered a m & s. because my shoulders are narrow the s fit better. front measurement shoulder to hem is 24"" on both the s and the m. plenty of length for me. i also wasn't looking for a tight fit around the waist and tucking in just the front as shown on the model looks great. i saw thi",pos
"Love the dress. it's beautiful and flowy and makes you feel like a princess when you wear it. also very versatile, as it can be worn in multiple seasons and dressed up or dressed down. love everything about the dress and know that it will become a staple in my closet. runs true to size- xs = 0/2 and s = 2/4. if you are short, be prepared to have the hem taken up. 

worth the buy!",pos
"This is a very substantial, warm sweater that is so classy and super soft and just different enough. really great with neutral sweater leggings or jeans with boots. you have to wear a longer tank or tee underneath as it it split on the sides but the belt cinches the whole sweater in.",pos
"I just got this today & love it. the embroidery on the front is gorgeous & rich looking. the material is soft & has a nice weight so that it drapes perfectly & is not at all see through. it will look great with sandals, flats or sandals with heels. i wear an xs & it fits tts. it falls just above the knee. i can see me wearing this a lot. i was worried about it looking too youthfull for my age, but it doesn't at all.",pos
So stylish. i have gotten tons of compliments on this sweater. i absolutely love it!,pos
The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.,pos
I loved how soft the top was on my skin... plus the sexy detail in the back was a win !,pos
"I am 5'3"", 28/38 and got the sp. had no issues whatsoever, and love the colors.",pos
"Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3"" and got a size small, a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style, fits great",pos
"I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium, even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.",pos
I ordered this top despite the other reviews and i'm very glad i did. it is adorable. well made and very flattering. i am usually a size xs or 00 but based on the reviews sized up to a 0. fits perfectly. not snug at all. highly recommend!,pos
I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work. the cut was so strange. it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist. i even ordered up a size based on reviews. i ordered an 8 when i normally where a small (6) in things. the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else.,neg
"Easy to wear with black or grey. i will wear as a work jacket, not necessarily just an outwear piece",pos
I fell in love with this shirt in the store and it has become one of my favorite items in my closet! the bright pink contrasts perfectly with the white peplum bottom and the fit is wonderfully flattering!,pos
"This top is super comfy and easy to wear. i found it to be a bit darker tan than it looks online, but still quite cute. it's flowy but still gives you shape, overall it was a great buy.",pos
This price is amazing and goes with everything! fits great! so glad i made this purchase.,pos
"I love the cut of these pants! kind of a flare, kind of a boot cut and super flattering. they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg. they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size. i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg. i consider them more pants then denim.",pos
"I absolutely love these capris. after reading the reviews, i thought that they may fit a bit snug through the thigh, but they fit perfectly. i am roughly a size six (depending on the design, i can sometimes squeeze into a 4). i bought the size 27 in these and its perfect. also, i thought that the green would be more of a mint, but its definitely a more of a mossy color. i love that they are so versatile and literally go with everything! will be getting more colors in the future! great buy!",pos
"I bought this shirt in white, i have worn it 2 ways so far and love it. i wore it under a pull over and had the tail ends stick out and it was great that way, and i wore it with a long cardigan. i received a lot of compliments on it. i will be buying it in red!!",pos
"I ordered this top in xsp and xs. i don't think i let the xsp top breathe long enough, because i thought it was too short and sent it back. (there is no retailer near me...) i kept the xs, and at first thought the same thing about it not fitting right, but by the end of the day it stretched just enough, and felt just right. really pretty top. i received a lot of compliments on it.",pos
"I tried this on at antho today and loved it! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors. it is flattering in person. the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer, but this is probably better anyway with spring coming (it is coming, right?-today it's snowing) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it. it is versatile and could be paired with anything.",pos
"Adorable! very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit. i'm sure i'll wear this with jeans, as pictured, but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt.",pos
"The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didn't flatter my shape. i think it would work better on someone very thin. the criss-cross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didn't sit right. even worse, the bust portion made me look flat (and i'm a full c cup).",neg
I bought this to wear with a skirt that i wanted to dress down - i needed something that was long enough to be able to tuck it in without having that awkward line. its a great fit.,pos
"I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding and couldn't be happier! i'm very curvy (34dd-28-43) and the medium fit like a glove. the fabric has a great 70's vibe while the fit is extremely classic. i have never felt more beautiful and received many compliments. i am 5'6"" and it hit just to the top of my feet. i highly recommend.",pos
"Ladies don't let this beauty get away. never paid much attention to it on-line but went into local retailer today and it was returned by someone. i couldn't get it on fast enough. it is gorgeous. runs tts. i took the small, for reference i am 36c top and petite. this will work on any body type. you won't be sorry. well worth the money for the style and fabric.",pos
"I don't normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag.",neg
Love! color and fabric are beautiful! new fav,pos
The perfect simple black top. great fit - can be dressed up or down. closet staple!,pos
"I love this cut of shirt. the stripes are fun. i did have to go up a size due to my bust (34dd), which made the lower part a little bit more flow-y. regardless, i still love this top. so much that i have bought 3 of the prints available.",pos
There's a free people version of this top and this by far surpasses the fit of it. i'm 5'3 and purchased the xl and it fits me exactly like the model. i would say it is tts and extremely soft.,pos
"This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy, comfortable, but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops, or polish it up with some cute boots.",pos
"This top is really cute and i love the design. however, the first time i wore it, the waste band started unraveling.",neg
"I'm 5'7"" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. 

it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com",neg
"Pilcro has become my go to brand for pants as they always seem to fit with consistent sizing.  i'm an 8-10 and size 30 never fails to fit perfectly.  i've got hips and a booty so it's great to have a brand that works with my curves.  these chinos are super soft and feel like pants i've had for years -- broken in but still look polished.  i bought the green (which is really teal) and feel in love with them. i've since bought the gray and sand/khaki color.  i'm 5'6"" and the length hits just below",pos
"I have gotten constant compliments on this dress and it is very flattering. i normally wear a large or a size 12 and i had to order this in an xl. i am big busted so that makes the difference.

this could be so easily dressed up but easily made casual with a denim jacket or sweater.

one of my favorite fall purchases.",pos
"This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures. fit is true to size, perfect drape, lined & not clingy, just perfect in every way. it's at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell out--grab it now in your size while you can! 

only ""con"" i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes, but maybe they make it in petite...?",pos
"This is such a fun version of a v-neck tshirt. the lines and seams are very flattering, the neckline is perfect. i'm 5'10"" a size 10/12 (depending) and i ordered the medium in the navy which fit perfectly. the length was slightly shorter on me than the model. overall a great shirt. highly recommended.",pos
I love this dress. the pattern is super cute and looks great with a jean jacket and comfy sandals or white sneakers. tons of compliments!!,pos
"I ordered this when i first saw it on line but it was backordered. it just arrived today and i am so very happy with it. so feminine, kind of vintage yet modern. the epitome of the retailer aesthetic. i typically wear a 0p ( 32 a -26-35: 5 ft 2 in) in tracy reese and the 0p is perfect. i gave a 4 for quality only because it is polyester, (however that also keeps the price down). it seems that every summer plenty by tracy reese comes out with a dress that becomes my go -to favorite and this year is",pos
"I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model, but on me it looked tacky.  i'm 5'6 and 130 lbs, and this dress hit me in all the wrong places.  i got a size small- sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress (and the arm holes are already dangerously large).  i wish this were just a little bit a-line.  instead, it's literally like someone just extended the length of a t-shirt.",neg
"Love the style of this vest, and an added bonus is how soft it is. every vest is different, though, so if you're shopping in the store, be sure to look at all of them.",pos
I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!,pos
Got so many complements! really comfy but runs big! i'm usually a large and i wish i had gotten the small.,pos
This tank was much needed for my wardrobe. i love the vivid colors and forgiving cut. i am 130lbs and purchased an xs .,pos
This shirt is such a beautiful color! the lavender is a really lovely addition to spring wardrobe and goes with more than imagined. it has a bit of an oversized fit although it falls really nicely on slimmer silhouettes. it's also incredibly comfy and stylish with an updated look even to the most casual of attire.,pos
This shirt is so cute with the cutout stripes and it goes with everything. it's easy to wear and true to size. you can dress it up or dress it down. the fabric is soft but also light weight. i am so happy to own this classic piece.,pos
This dress is amazing! the photos do not do it justice! runs a tad large - definitely can size down.,pos
"Love this top, you can really fess up, i ordered in a small i am 5 7 and 154 pounds",pos

"This is a very pretty sweater, a bit boxy and short but cute. i am 5'1"" and ordered the regular xs in black. the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace. i would have kept this if it was plain black lace. just did not like that look.",neg
"Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/29, hips 36. bought the size 4. i'm expecting a bit of stretch to allow a bit more room for the booty...3% spandex and they seem like standard cartonnier 'charlie' fit.
i love the kicky cropped flare.
they're described as grey motif but everyone in store (and i agree) called them green. the main diamonds are forest green with a grey/green inset and a blue/grey inset inside that. (whew!)
they come with an extra button, keep it as those tiny buttons are going to be first",pos
"This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful.   very soft, nice shape, unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops, but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking.  (i am  5 ft 8 in tall).  even sizing up, it's far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned, but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!",pos
"This top is really nice and the fabric is more substantial than it looks in the photo. it has a great shape and is nicely made. i ordered an xs, which i nesrly always wear, but i measure 35"" in the bust and it fits well, but no extra room. i'm petite and it is not too oversized. really cute top and a great value.",pos
"I hate to be so negative but i can't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews. it is stiff, silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest. adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse. looks cheap.",neg
All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i'm having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i'm thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection.,pos
"I was so bummed to see how quickly this top sold out online in the black. however, to my delight, i happened to stumble upon the shirt in my size in my local store recently. knowing it was sold out online, i immediately grabbed it to try on. big mistake: i instantly fell in love. i'm a curvy woman (34d chest, wide hips, small waist and a slight tummy) and this shirt fits beautifully in my usual size (which is a medium in deletta). hugs my figure without making me look big. i work in an office wh",pos

"Love this jacket! this picture shows the sleeves rolled down, but in the stores they have them rolled up and i have to say that is how you'll most likely wear it as the sleeves might be too short if you rolled them down. however, it is still a fabulous fall coat! it does run slightly large, but it depends on how you want it to fit. i am typically a medium, and i bought the m/l because the xs/s was a little fought in the shoulders. i bought last weekend and already wore twice because it looks gre",pos
This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.,neg

"So to put this in some perspective, when i tried on this dress for my husband after bringing it home, he described it as ""possibly the best dress you've ever bought."" so that's definitely a winner! i think what makes the dress great is that it's not clingy, but still had a good drape. on the skinny models, it looks large and flowy, but on my curvier body, it draped beautifully and is super flattering, without being clingy or too tight. i'm usually a size 10, 36ddd, and i sized down to a medium s",pos
"This dress is especially beautiful in person. the tulle doesn't snag and lays nice and flat, not point. this dress is easy to dress up or dress down, fits comfortably and has some stretch to it. the bodice does run a little high, higher than what is shown in the model picture, but lovely nonetheless.",pos

"I bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since. i love that you can wear it either on or off-the-shoulder. the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy, comfortable, and easy to wear. on the shoulder i've even worn it to work on casual friday. the print is versatile, and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey. i definitely recommend, especially since i notice it is now on sale!! it is generously sized, so i'd recommend erring",pos

Great with a tank top underneath and jeans. i also wore with a delicate gold necklace. charming!,pos
"Such a beautiful pattern - i think you could wear it with a skirt and it wouldn't even read as a bathing suit. love the lacy pattern in front. great fit. i bought a medium, when i usually wear a small in retailer. it fits a little loose, so i'd probably buy a small if i bought another one, but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit.",pos
"This top is wonderfully comfortable and well made. i've taken a few accidental naps while wearing it because i was just so comfortable. at the same time, i receive complements on the shirt every time i wear it. itt pairs well with so many types of pants. the only negative is that i only own one (the cream color). i regret greatly that i did not purchase it in all available colors when i had the chance! i really hope to see this top come back again later!",pos
Obsessed with these pants. i have them in the green color and was looking for them to go on sale ! great fit very comfortable,pos

"Couldn't make it work, even belted. ivory color is darker irl--dingy light tan, like dirty vintage. ""drop"" waist is not dropped at all, just a maternity-ish cut that starts boxy-loose high up (below bust), then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level (not low hip) into the skirt. i usually find a-line cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy, curvy waist, but this does not--adds ten pounds. poly fabric heavy/hot; rayon lining awkward and doesn't flow/drape.

"I am 5' 4"" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!",pos
These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.,pos
"This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time.",neg
"I'd been eyeing this for a long time but couldn't afford the full price. when it came on sale, my size -- regular 8 -- was sold out. so i took a chance and went with the petite 8 (only difference is length). and am i glad i did!

it fits beautifully, even a little roomy. but the length is perfect. the longer pieces are at/barely below the knee, and the shorter flap is about two inches above. (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 135 pounds, measurements 38-30-38.)

the skirt is substantial, with high-qualit",pos
"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5"", 120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it.",pos
Hello i could not see how this dress could get anything but a 5 star review . the only thing that i thought would be a negative is that it may stag easily. other than that this dress is stunning on and i feel it runs large . i wear a sz 4 and the xs fit just right i'm 5ft 6in tall looks great with a high heel since its really long to the floor which i like as far as the shine on this dress. i love it it makes it worth the price and dresses up a casual dress . and its very comfortable .,pos
"I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! it's a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f, so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new, fuller shape for me. i'm on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer, and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w",pos
"I am 5'6"", 130lbs, size 27, short-legged, and these jeans fit perfectly. i've learned that pilcro's serif fit is my go to, and these did not disappoint. not only are they a flattering fit, they are the ideal medium blue denim, and they aren't covered in excessive whiskering, which seems to plague most jeans.",pos
This top is extremely well made. the fabric is so soft. the style is very stylish. it is very figure flattering and chic. a keeper! i'm petite and the style is not overwhelming.,pos
"Even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse, but i'm so happy i did! the fabric looks as high quality in-person as it does in the picture, and it isn't see-through. the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion, but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop. the buttons down the back are a fun, cute detail, and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out.",pos
"I wasn't all that impressed with this dress on the hanger, but i am so glad i tried it on. it is super comfortable, very flattering, and can be worn multiple ways. spot on!",pos
"Bought this in dark grey, which has a lovely bluish hue. the fabric is soft & comfy and it has great lines for a knit fabric. very flattering! the sleeves are nice and long.",pos
"I love this top! although it is a tad big, i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big. however, i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it's too big.... hope that makes sense! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair, but the yellow was so pretty too!",pos
"This sweater is warm and cozy. it has flattering lines the way it closes, the banded detail at the hem and sleeve details. please remember it is wool so right next to your skin my be itchy. however it is the best sweater for a slim flattering warm look.",pos
"I have this tee in every single color and love it. this shirt is so soft, airy, and comfortable, and the ribbon embellishment on the back dresses it up a little. i love wearing leggings or skinny jeans with it and accessorizing with an infinity scarf. i normally wear a size small, but i sized up to a medium this time. there is very little difference in the two sizes, but i liked the modest increase in length. i'm glad that i did this, because the tees shrunk ever so slightly after being in the d",pos
"Absolutely love, love this dress. it is so comfortable and falls perfectly. the material is great and you can dress it up or wear it casually. if it had more colors, i would get it it in any color it came in!!",pos
Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!,pos
I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress. there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress.,neg
"These jeans not only fit well, i love the way the fabric feels. for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin. i am 5'8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect. they call them ""hi-rise"", but them seem more like a ""mid-rise"" to me which i prefer. i am going to buy another pair in a different wash.",pos
"This top when pulled out of the box didn't look like much, the contrast of the buttons, wrinkly, shapeless... but, when i shook it out, tried it on i fell in love. it's so simple and versatile. prob the best white shirt i purchased this year, i'd say it pretty flowly, but that's the style and i love it. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i would purchase again, and in other colors if they had them.",pos
"These pants are so warm and cozy and comfortable. they are like cashmere for your legs...so amazingly soft!! and for that price, it's definitely worth getting all the colors!!",pos
"I am a huge fan of all things ""mother"" brand now. they fit great and are true to size! they have just the right amount of stretch, but maintain their fit all day.",pos
"This is a gem. stretchy, graphic, easy to wear, lightweight and so fun! the best thing about this is it can be worn as a jumpsuit or as a higher waisted pant! i've seen it paired with a pilcro denim jacket and cute sandals, and then worn as pants with a black tank, jacket and silver belt. i love that this can be dressed up or down...you could even throw it on over your bathing suit as a coverup. i would go true to size on this one since there is some room and the top has great stretch.",pos
I am currently wearing this dress. i wear it whenever i can get away with it. i have it in red and it works incredible on my coloring. the front is modest enough for work while the back is sweet and unexpected.,pos
Not for shorties. i'm 5'3 and will need to get them hemmed.,pos
Material is awful. not soft at all. colors are much darker than shows online. it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model. it went back.,neg
"I was struggling with the options above-- does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large? it is both too small and too large, which is really strange. the model makes this shirt look stunning, but the product is actually very boxy. i am 5' 3"", weigh 112 lbs and i typically order anywhere from a 00p-0r/xxs-xs. i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy. quite frankly, it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money",neg
"Loved this sweater coat the first time i saw it online......then the price....yikes! the style, color and fabric design is beautiful. waited for it to sale and then hurray an extra 30%. off to my local store for a try on as i would not have wanted to even try it at the regular price. it is wonderful! it runs very large. i went down two sizes to achieve the fit i was looking for from a large to a small. in my opinion the product shot model is wearing a size too large. even sizing down it is not t",pos
I love this top! i think the knit rib quality is quite lovely and the color is gorgeous. i bought the plum color and got many compliments while wearing it. i like that it's a little on the longer side. i wore it with my pull-on ponte pants and booties. very cute!!,pos
"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit, flattering silhouette, comfortable fabric, shape enhancing cut, and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd",pos
"Plan to wear this with pants. may not fit some body types due to the tie and cocoon sleeve styling, but i recommend trying on before deciding. truly stunning athough the weight of the silk is very light. would have been better at this price point if it was heavier weight, but still not a bad value.",pos
"So, i want to start off by saying, the quality of this shirt really was great. as was the pattern, unfortunately if you're going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model. this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom, it's not a straight fit as the picture would suggest. i'm sure this works for some women but if you're muscular with an already v-shape to your body (meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have",neg
Oh my! i love this tee. it is super soft. i love how it doesn't look like a sack with no shape. i can't wait to get more colors. i am tall plus have a long torso and it still is long enough for me so this is definitely a win!,pos
"I very rarely pay full price for anything, let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that's how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful, and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is, the length of the torso is long enough, the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it's flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs, 34b and the small fit",pos
"This poncho is perfect! the slits on the side may seem intimidating at first, but wear a flowy tank under neath it for a nice added detail. it's easy to wear over a fitted dress as well, or a high-waisted full skirt.
i have red hair and the gold looks amazing with that hair color. but the grey and creme are neutral and go well with a lot of options.",pos
"This is stunning. it's almost snug for a 2 (i'm 5'6, 123 lb) but that might be because it's strapless. it's constructed with a bra inside so you can get away without wearing one. i can't wait to wear this and i'm going to have to find an event good enough to deserve this dress. i feel like audrey hepburn in this.",pos
"Lovely dress. i was a bit hesitant as a reviewer mentioned the fabric being irritable but luckily i had no issues. the regular is long and i have to wear it with my wedge, but i'm ok with that.",pos
"Soft, comfortable, flattering, versatile--what more can you ask for? just wish it came in a long-sleeved version.",pos
I am in love with this top. i was a little nervous because i'm on the bustier side (34d/dd) but it works for me so i say give it a shot--you never know. i'm hoping for more tops like this in the fall line.,pos
"What can i say? this is a winner! it is stunning, gorgeous, a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet. it is classic, early 1960s look, which is exactly my style! i am usually a 14 or a 16, so i went with a 16 based on the reviews, and it fits divinely. i don't need another orange dress, but this is a keeper!",pos
"Material is very soft and the cut is flattering. i got the yellow and pink. yellow is more of a brown color, but i still like it.",pos
"So cozy and warm, great for the cold nights!",pos
Was pleasantly surprised at house nice this too was! the colors are beautiful.  the top is  flowy and drapes nicely.  true to size. i'm a 4/6 and ordered a small.,pos
"I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is. there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top. the fabric will most definitely snag, as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin - not very good quality. i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge, everywhere but the neck.",neg
"These feel so soft and amazing. i especially love that the length work for me, just a tiny bit long and i am 5'4. i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans.",pos
"Great colors, style and fit",pos
"This is a beautiful top! it fits like a glove, very flattering.& got lots of compliments.
i am 5'4"" and 125 lbs, i bought size medium. love it! worth the money:)",pos
"I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine, without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist, but it's still very flattering.",pos
"I love this shirt. i actually bought two in black (my ""uniform""), then decided to order one in white as well. however, the white shirt fit differently than the two black ones! it was significantly shorter; over 2' shorter! while the black tee is the perfect length, the shorter white version wasn't flattering on me and kind of flared out around my waist...not the best look. that being said, i know the black shirt will be in heavy rotation for a while, and the people at retailer were very und",pos
This looks just as pictured. it's comfortable but dressy. i love it!,pos
This dress is very cute and screams summer. the stripped skirt adds dimension. true maxi length. effortless and fun!,pos
"I'm 5'5"" and 140 lbs - hardly super-tiny and the xs was swimming on me. the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweater/jacket just hangs off the body. believe it when they say ""oversized styling"" - unfortunately will have to return.",neg
"I have this top with the red stitching and it is one of my most favorite items from retailer ever. i wear it with a tank top underneath so i haven't noticed any itchiness like the other reviewer mentioned. 
i wear it with slightly cropped slim boyfriend jeans and i get so many compliments every time i wear it.
i wish i had it in the blue color too!",pos
"I love the embroidery detailing on the top. i think this shirt looks better in person than online.

i'm an hourglass shape, and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest, but this top drapes down nicely. however, loose shirts like this aren't my style, so i belt this at my waist, and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider), and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10""). i also appreciate that the armholes are small,",pos
There's are just what i was looking for! these are perfect in texture and thickness...not too thick but not too thin. super soft fleece on the inside. i both both the black and green...i will most likely but the grey soon enough.,pos
I bought the top in an x-large because i normally wear a 12/14 and i was swimming in it. i unfortunately returned it but did eventually buy the large. it is a cute fit and a fun tee to have. the fabric is soft but a little excessive on the bottom.,pos
"Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs, but i am glad i chose this one. first, the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier, which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and, the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.",pos
"So pretty. 5'4"" 115 lbs and the xs fits perfectly.",pos
"Love the cut of this t-shirt. just loose enough but not big and boxy like so many other tees but not fitted either. nice weight, the hemline is interesting...overall happy with it. just hope it doesn't shrink!",pos
"I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5"", medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal",pos
"I had my reservations given that i'm petite (5'2"", 108lbs) and it's midi style. i'm glad that i took a chance. i bought the red motif and it's beautiful. it's wrinkle-free right out of the package. the color is vibrant and the style is classic and effortless. fits true-to-size. great for work with a black tee as shown in the picture.",pos
"I had originally bought this top in one of your stores and loved it!!! got sooo many compliments!!! while reading my e-mail one night, i saw it on sale!! of course i would have bought it anyway!!! now i have 2 of my favorite tops!!!",pos
"Like the other reviewers, this is my new favorite tee. it's so freaking soft, and the ribbon down the back just gives a little added flare. pure+good has been one of my staple brands for basics for a while, and i will definitely be buying more colors in this. the length is perfect for leggings, and it would be cute with jeans too.",pos
"Love this dress, i've already worn it many times. i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured. the length is great and works with tights or boots.

great unique dress!",pos
"Love this dress! i bought the blue motif. which barely has any blue at all. it is the softest cotton dress i own. i wore it with my red hunter boots today and it made for the best rainy day ensemble. love, love! and i got it on sale which just sweetens the deal :)",pos
"I haven't owned a skort in years! this one is super cute and so soft! i love the details, the asymmetrical cut and the buckles. i bought it in olive green. it fits really well. i'm 5'5"" 119 lbs with an athletic frame and i purchased a size 2 (my normal size). it fits comfortably around my waste and thighs/but with some wiggle room. 

i'm wearing it today w/ a navy blue/cream floral tank top, white/navy striped vans, and a gold dangly necklace. i love that its a versatile item and i'm looking f",pos
"Super cute. 5'9"" 135 lbs and the medium was perfect to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath. good quality and lined too. perfect for daytime when a leather moto might be a bit much.",pos
"This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops, but timy i always size up. i'm a 36c, and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer, but not so much you need a cami.",pos
"Got these in my usual size and they are wonderful! the gray goes with everything, i'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too!",pos
The cut is perfect and the rose color is so pretty!  it fits like the typical left of center sizing.  i wish it came in more colors!,pos
"The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.",neg
Love this vintage high waisted bikini bottom! fits true to size. it pulls up to a little past my belly button and the runching is in all the right places. i'm not too sure how it will stay put in the waist area for a dip in the ocean . can't wait to lounge around in it ar the beach though.,pos
"Wonderful fabric. surprisingly great fit. super flattering. i'm so glad i bought it, despite jumpsuits being a bit of a risk online.",pos
"This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.
the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.",neg
"Love this chemise. perfect blend of comfort and sexy. i bought it in pink, size small. i'm a 32d about 115 lbs and if fit perfectly, i could even probably go to an xs, but i didn't want to wait. the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant. looks exactly like the picture. decent price.",pos
"This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders, which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great, modest and cute swimsuit.",pos
"The colors in this dress are beautiful (the green/blue version) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy. i purchased it online and wasn't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown, i really wanted to love it but it's going back.",neg
"I am 5'4"" and the regular sweater i tried in the store was too long. i ordered the petite online and it is perfect! it's warm and comfortable and can be worn different ways which makes it great for stretching my wardrobe. love it!",pos
"Not sure why this tunic dress is rated only 3 stars. i love it, as i do all coth & stone pieces. and it is cloth & stonw as another reviewer pointed out. the material is great and fit is tts except for the sleeves being just a bit tight. this dress does not run large as do some c&s pieces so don't size down. i'm 5'7"", 126 lbs and slender, and the m is perfect. if you have large or very muscular arms, this dress might not work for you. i plan to layer with a thin tee underneath, tights and boots",pos
This dress is effortlessly chic. i wore it with black tights and booties and it was perfection. will definitely be a casual staple year around.,pos
"These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits great
the tie dye is very unique love it!",pos
"I love both the color of this sweater as well as the buttons on the cuffs. this sweater is an easy pick any day of the week and goes well with all of my work pants. plus, the soft and pretty pink adds some brightness to my otherwise dark winter wardrobe.",pos
"These pilcro's jeans are so good!!! love the fit, the color, and the feel. i am a curvy girl and these are great, they hit me just right. now pilcro jeans used to strech out really bad but they seemed to have fixed the problem.i wore these jeans at work for 10 hours and they did stretch some but not a dress size, so i would buy the size you feel the most comfortable. i think these are a no brainer!",pos
"Love this dress. great lightweight fabric, bold colors, and lined to the knee. the lining makes sure the dress lies smooth, but it breaths well so it doesn't add extra heat. i found it ran true to size and it's a good length for tall girls. i like that you can tie the belt in the front or back. looks great on it's own or dress it up with a statement necklace. there is also a nice girth to the skirt giving it lots of movement. great find.",pos
I was drawn to the green/blue color in store! it's so cute and comfortable. i'm usually a size 2/4 and needed the 2. the bodice is flattering and the length was perfect on me. i'm even 4 months pregnant with my 2nd baby and this will work with my growing belly for another month or so. it's got great stretch!,pos
Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s,neg
"I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person, and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring, summer, or even fall with a cardigan.",pos
"Love love love this dress! have received so many compliments on it. i'm 5'4"", 118 and xs fit perfectly. love the cap sleeves and details, super comfortable too. i can see wearing this year-round and dressing it up/down.",pos
"I purchased this dress in ""yellow"" in a size 8 and 10 since i'm between sizes, and the 8 fits like a dream. i love this dress. it's a nice length, hitting just below my knees, and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great. i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it. i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person, but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing. highly recommend!",pos
I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.,pos
"I love this dress. i am wearing it for thanksgiving! i bought the black because the red was sold out, but would definitely buy more colors. true to size. i'm 5'6"" 135 and bought the 6. only issue is i have to wear a slip underneath because it's not lined and a tiny bit low cut for me.",pos
I love this top and the relaxed fit. can be dressed up or down. i bought the bird print and liked it so much i purchased the umbrella print. now i'm contemplating getting the mixed dot! easy to just throw on with anything and the mix of colors keeps it versatile too!,pos
"I love this dress! very comfortable fit, and lots of compliments for the color (moss). took me from the classroom to a cocktail party. one of my best retailer purchases.",pos
"What a great, soft piece for fall.  the top is flattering and comfy at the same time. it looks really romantic with the bare shoulder look.",pos

Love this sweater skirt by tracy reese. i'm a huge fan of tracy reese clothing and this skirt doesn't disappoint. super comfortable. the colors in the skirt are amazing too. many different colors to pull from. i can see myself dressing this up or dressing it down with flat boots and a denim jacket. i felt it fit tts. i usually wear a small in retailer skirts that aren't numeric sizes. got this one in small.,pos

I love these pants the only thing i would say is that they don't run small! i read reviews saying they are small in the waist so i ordered a size up and ended up regretting it. other then that i love them,pos
"This dress intrigued me a bit online, but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack, i wasn't so sure about it, but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh, flattering, flowy, light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric, the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist, but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great",pos
"Nice quality fabric that's soft to the touch, lightweight, and lays smoothly. runs small - great for those of us who are small on top! the s fits like xs. longer length but not tunic length. the navy can pass for dark silver-gray.",pos
I got this in the blue and love it. tts and the shape is very unique and classy- better than shown on the model. it can be worn alone or with a long sleeve underneath as a layer. considering the neutral as well.,pos
Great shirt that is basic with a little something extra. meadow rue does it again...i swear i buy everything they put out...,pos
"I am so happy i decided to try this on in store. it is absolutely stunning! unfortunately they only had a m and it was a little too flowy so have the s ordered and anxious to try it on. the top is really where i am concerned it is too large. i am 5'3"", 36dd and 130#, athletic build. since you really cannot wear a bra with it, which is okay btw, the armholes were a little too open and afraid things may show ;). the bottom fit okay, a little on the large side but this should fit loose and flowy. c",pos
This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!,pos
"I love the design of this top, however, it's quality is lackluster. the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering (at least on me) if it had a few more inches. also it's pretty sheer, so figuring out under garments is a dilemma. i will still wear it because i love it. looks great with a denim vest over it!",neg
"Citizens of humanity jeans are excellent!!! i prefer high rise & this brand is my favorite. i like the clean lines & plain design. the material is comfortable- substantial with just enough stretch in the material which makes them super comfortable. i'm not constantly pulling these jeans up, they hold their shape really well & wash well too. they run tts.",pos
Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!,pos
"This jacket is stunning. the vegan leather has a slight shimmer. the waterfall fabric is nice and soft. it's really beautiful and unique. cropped jackets tend to shorten me, but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely. the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight. they were better in the xsp but i won't be wearing any thick sweaters underneath. it fit everywhere else. i'm usually an xxsp, and sized up for the arms. ove",pos
Great addition to wardrobe ...have already worn a lot. soft and lightweight.,pos
This skirt is a keeper. great quality. beautiful color. great fit!,pos
Very nice and the sleeve have a great design and the length is finally long enough,pos
"This dress is gorgeous in person and so comfortable. i wore this to a business meeting and got several compliments on it. i am 5 feet tall and it does run a little long on me, a petite small hits me slightly below the knee. however, the dress is so nice that i am keeping it.",pos
"Nice jeans, fit true to size and look as pictured. i recommended those to a friend and she bought and liked them as well.",pos
Bought the blue/gray - love the color. just the right amount of cling. adorable alone or under cardigan. super deal on sale.,pos

"This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.",pos
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! the grey is more vibrant in real life than the picture suggests and the maroon red is perfect for fall and winter. seriously, this is not your typical sweater dress; the sheer sleeves elevate it to a whole other level. it comes to just above the knee on my 5'7"" frame. it is a bit looser on top (i'm 32c) and more form-fitting around the hips but not tight or clingy. and so comfortable! i am 122 lbs and took my usual small so i think it runs true to size. the sl",pos
"So comfortable, fit just right, flattering, beautiful neutral color, but different, love the embroidery, nothing bad about it. that being said, i haven't worn them the whole day, i suspect they will stretch a bit. also have not washed them, so i hope the color stays the nice rich dark gray turquoise, the length is perfect too, i ordered the petite and they fit as on the model (for a change, i have pretty short legs). (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist, muscular legs)",pos
"The dress i received was not in the least what i was expecting, and in the best way possible. i initially purchased the dress as something i could wear to work, but when i put it on, it was clear the dress was meant for something a bit more fun. it's more along the lines of a sweater dress and is very flattering and chic.",pos
I bought this top because i loved the floral print. i had no idea i was getting a top notch quality top. i love the flow of the bottom and the zipper in the back is so classy. it has a lining and the coolest thing about it is the snaps that protect your bra from showing. love love love this top!!,pos
"Every byron lars dress that i have is definitely beyond ordinary and this one is no exception. i love the petals that adorn the front.  my dress was back ordered for a couple of months but it was well worth the wait. i wore it recently and received compliments galore. if you're undecided about this one, go for it!!!  it's a winner.",pos
"This is my first ever review! these pants are 5-star fantastic. ordering additional colors because i love these so much and am finding i want to wear them every day. i initially ordered the bronze color which is superb, just beautiful. i was worried it might be too bright to wear to work, or be a different hue in real life, but they look just like the picture. to my happy surprise they dress up easily. it's a really rich color that i have been able to pull off at work with long sweaters and boot",pos
"I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale!

"Wonderful fabric, drapes nicely from waist= flattering, use for air travel as not too heavy in weght. beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors. nice addition to tight, patterned pants & boots. dress up or casual",pos

"I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5'2"" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it's not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn.",neg
"Love this comfy, breezy dress. so easy & cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out. i gave 4 stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets, which i'll fix next time the sewing basket is out. i think the double layers of gauze-like material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals, so be a careful around claws & paws. the back side is straight which isn't as interesting as the front but for my use, the dress is darling.",pos
"I love the way this dress fits and flares in all the right places making it one of the most flattering dresses i've tried in a while. for me, maeve dresses tend to run a bit big, so i sized down to a small (i'm typically an 8-10). the colors are a little deeper/richer in person, which made me very happy. i love the flounce in the skirt - it adds more swing to the dress. the only draw back was the v-neck came down a bit low. easy fix with a cami for work.",pos
"I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me, but it did not. i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big. it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame. overall, it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else! if you're tall and slender, i think this top would work!",neg
"Quite possibly, one of the most flattering, beautiful, and effortlessly romantic dresses i have ever tried on. and, to top it off, it has a sweet surprise: the silk slip on the inside of the dress has the same print as the outside shell, and it is so lovely, that if you feel like wearing something short and sweet, you can wear the slip as its own dress.

runs true to size, to maybe just a little bit big--if you have a smaller bustline and narrow hips, you might be able to size down.

"I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7"" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this ""in between"" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere.

"I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6"" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus",pos
I do not know where to begin....this sweater exceeds my expectation! i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopper....as beautiful as that one is...this one made my mouth fall open. it is unlike anything i have. it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways. not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything! order your regular size as it is suppose to be big!,pos
I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color.,pos
"I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well, these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love",pos
"This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!
i would recommend this product",pos
"If you are like i am and love coats that stand out......this is for you. there are many +++++++++'s first being the quality, embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not, also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me. it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right, colors are wonderful and fit is tts. it also,looks great belted and much nicer in person.....",pos
"Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i'm only 5'2"" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn't great as it's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it's going back!",neg
I was using my daughter's dress and ended up buying myself one as well. it is a versatile casual dress... very flattering. (and my daughter and i have different builds) i actually wish that they sold this in more colors.,pos
These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there.. i am returning the item.,neg
"This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.",pos
"I am five foot tall, about 103lb and got the petite zero - it fits perfectly and i love the flower pattern! great for weddings, parties or work.",pos
This is perfect if you are looking for comfort and style in the same bathing suit.,pos
"I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!",pos
"I cannot say enough good things about this dress. as a petite person (5'0), it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations, but this dress fit perfectly. it's also so well-made: the fabric is soft, comfortable, and gorgeously detailed, and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume (in a good, flattering way)! i got it shortened by about 2"", but this dress fits like a dream.",pos
"Love everything about these pants. a little sheer, but super beautiful and comfortable.",pos
"I must admit that i was a little hesitant to try this top on, largely due to my shape.
fyi: broad shoulders/back, 36c, short waist, 5'3"" 
typical size: dress or button-down shirt 12, knit or not fitted top, m
i purchased the heart design in a size m, since the upper part of the shirt is oversized a little bit (not too big and baggy, though) and then narrowis to the waist. think ""upside-down triangle"", as the shape of the top. since this is also my shape on top (6 on bottom), i worried that th",pos
"So pretty and flattering. it's my new favorite blouse. it's also really comfortable. i do not tuck this one in. i love the knit material makes it extra comfy and breathable. the colors are very pretty and wearable. the quality and cratsmanship are impressive. it has a straight bottom hem and slight boxy cut which i like. i am 5'3"" and weight 126 lbs. i ordered the small , but i was going go a slightly bigger comfy fit. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.",pos
This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.,neg
"Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5'9""). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i've tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can",pos
Fun blouse for spring with enough details to make it unique and dressy. very comfortable fit. banded bottom which is loose enough to still be comfortable. dresses up a pair of jeans quite nicely!,pos
"Great fit, very soft fabric, and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.",pos
This is perfect! it fits tts. i am usually an 8 and this was spot on. it isn't too short either. it really is as it appears on the model. i absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it. my hubby definitely approved!,pos
This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally 4-6 inches too wide. very disappointing! i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me. i don't usually wear xxs. it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white.,neg

"I have a long torso and wider back/thick middle in proportion to my narrow tights.  i was worried after reading other reviewers comments.  for reference i'm a 2 in pants, 26-27 in jeans, xs in retailer tops but for floreat and maeve i'm always a 6.  i ordered a size 6 and it was perfect.  with my long torso i expected this dress to fit weird but it was perfection.  in love.  i wore it with faryl robin lace up sandals",pos
The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.,neg
"I have broader shoulders and thick arms, this dress does an amazing job slimming my arms and not making me appear top heavy!
i'm 5'4 125 lbs, the xs fit perfectly",pos
"I was surprised at how soft this is. it also has snaps under each arm for definition, and on front for closure. didn't know that, and love it. got yesterday in mail, wore out last night. highly recommend.",pos
"Love this top! i receive so many compliments wearing it, even from my teenage boys! runs large, but that's the style of it, very flowy. very flattering.",pos
"Great fabric and design, beautiful pattern with flattering angled bottom hem and fringe. so soft and comfortable.  the hood is cuter left down. perfect transitional piece for fall.  i got the neutral color and it is so easy to wear.  i'm 5'3"" and got the s/xs size and feel that it is still wearable.  i second the opinion one reviewer mentioned about wearing a belt through the slit over the front part. definitely works well and makes for an effortlessly stylish look.",pos
"These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter, but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom! obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight, but these fit perfectly (even on the looser side) and ripped effortlessly. pretty embarrassing given the price! bringing these back! 

for reference ( if you decide to try your luck), i am 5'7"", 128# and my normal size s was perfect.",neg

Great coastal sweater. color in my opinion is a perfect rendition of coral. the sleeves hit just right for me to wear long or bunch them up. i can see this sweater paired with shorts or skinny jeans.,pos

"I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.",pos
"Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1"" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for",pos
What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.,pos
I am very pleased with this skirt! you can tell it is very well made and is just beautiful! very true to size!,pos
"Love this fun print. one of the most complimented items in my closet! i ordered petite after trying on the regular - regular was a bit too long for the look in the models photo. i am 5'5, size 0/2 usually. the blue has faded a little bit the pants have maintained their fun and funky vibe.",pos

Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you,pos
"I purchased the washed-out blue color. it is lovely with blue or black jeans. medium fit great. it is heavier cotton, and ever so slightly stretchy. this is not the kind of cotton to eventually come out of the dryer with tiny holes around the bottom of the tee. it is very comfortable. the embellishment on the sleeves is a nice touch, and i like the yoke with loop closure on the back. a fun addition to my casual wardrobe.",pos
I loved this skirt. they didn't have my size anymore so i tried on a few others. i really needed a small p. otherwise i totally would have kept it!,pos
"I wanted to wait until i could give this dress a thorough wearing before i reviewed it.  it exceeded my expectations!  i wore it at an outdoor wedding (the red) and received so many compliments on it.  it is well-constructed and the cutouts are gorgeous.  no danger so far of them ripping or tearing.  the zipper in the back is a little bulky for the dress, but not a major deterrent.

i'm 5'6"" and about 145lbs, and the size 6 (my usual retailer size) was perfect.",pos
"I bought this dress for a holiday party, and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it, but when i went to try it on, it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look, but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up, but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with, so they may sag.

overall, i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren",neg
"This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine.",pos
I saw this dress and i thought it would be perfect for that night that you don't feel like wearing just jeans yet you don't want to be overdressed. the dress is 100% cotton and is extremely comfortable. i paired with an open toe wide heeled bootie and a long necklace. the dress has a slight a line bottom but fits close to the body in chest and arms. extremely flattering for all body types and the color is a pretty blue. a dress for all seasons!!!!,pos
I got the jacket in the gray. it's a pretty pretty shade of gray. it's soft and feels really good on. it's short. like hits at the waist. i have long arms and the small for perfect which i was very pleased.,pos
"In true cloth & stone fashion, this product is incredibly soft and comfortable. i bought mine in petite small, but it will flatter a number of different body shapes and sizes. it's easy to launder (machine wash), and it will work as a perfect piece to dress up or down, depending on how you accessorize the product. i can't wait to wear this while i'm on the go and traveling over the summer.",pos
It definitely smells like vinegar but it went away after a few hours. i don't think its itchy. its kind of baggy and kind of has an ombrã© look to it fading down to darker. it looks casual in the pic but i can wear it out at night with cute earrings,pos
I love this! very comfortable & cute dress. true to size & picture. can't wait to wear it!,pos

"Usually retailer's designs run small for me, but this large fits great. super comfortable, long enough to wear with leggings. love the back cutout design and fabric choice. depending on bust size, it may seem to sit funny, but it's not meant to be a true baby doll design that sits under the bust. mine looks great :-)",pos
"I love this sweater! it's vivid, soft and high quality. it's a little shorter than i'd normally go for, but it will look great with a mid to high rise jean. it runs true to size and meant to be roomy. the red is very vibrant.",pos
"Adore the bright embroidery against the black background!  mine was well done and no loose threads.  although this is all synthetic fabric (which i hate paying for!) but i couldn't help myself once i tried it on.  it's very roomy and if you're slender, size down unless you prefer the breezy swingy look like i do.  this is a three season dress that will do well with layers and without.  i picked regular hem instead of petite and it actually looks slimmer on me than the shorter version.",pos
"I bought a suit similar to this last year, and loved it! this year i bought the pineapple print, and it is beautiful (size 2). it is classy/sexy. i have a long torso, so i like that it covers me better than most one piece swim suits i try on. i highly recommend this product!",pos

"This is a cute dress. the quality is very good for a dress of this type. the fabric is not too thin and the stitching is perfect. i do think it runs a little small. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p and i purchased this in the regular xs. regular xs is typically way too big, but i took a chance on this one because i really liked it and i also like my dresses a little bit longer than shown on the models. surprisingly, it fit well in the chest and the armholes were not too big, as is often the case",pos

I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit. it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. the fabric is light and it's very well made. great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats. i love it!,pos
"Yay hei hei! love these pants. thanks to the roll-up, they show a nice bit of ankle. lightweight but sturdy?i've been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans. they're a little poufy toward the top (below the waist), but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable. i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer. i did experience some stretching/sagging after a full day of walking, moving, and sitting, so i bought my second pair in m instead of l.

"I had a dress that felt like this in 1993. it jiggles, even if you don't. no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord. the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy. all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren.",neg
These are a great versatile pair of black pants. they look chic without trying too hard and they work well dressed up or down. they do run a bit big as others have said. i generally wear a 16 and thats what i got in these but they're definitely big and bag out by the end of the day.,pos
"Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.",neg
Colors are much more vibrant in person. love this skirt. true to size. makes a statement and is still classy.,pos
"Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and i'm obsessed! like previous reviews mentioned, it runs a little small in the chest. i'm normally a medium but am a 36c so ordered the large and it fits perfect! with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what. it's a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well.",pos

"Just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it. i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer. i am 5'5"" and  140 lbs. i took a small which is my usual size at retailer. could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank. i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer, but that doesn't bother me. another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us. i will wear this all summer long. looks great with denim. happy find!",pos
I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am 5 ft 4 and weigh 125 lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.,pos
I bought this dress for summer celebrations. the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress. the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front. i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket. definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down. very feminine and has a romantic feel.,pos
Love the sweater. the knit has a rich look and the fit is perfect. i paired it with a printed pencil skirt for an eclectic look. strongly recommend to your wardrobe.,pos

"On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don't think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it, but i liked the way it looked on me. i'm 5'3"", 140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it, the clerks loved it, and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans.",pos
"This top is beautiful! it drapes just like the picture with gorgeous details in the back. this is what i expect from retailer! i am 5'4"", 120# and 34b and took my size small so i would say tts. i tried it on with a strapless nude colored bra and it was not visible. give it a try you won't regret it!",pos
"I'm going to be straight out... this dress is very flattering and will get you a lot of male attention. so be warned!

i am a 34c and i got a size 2p. it fit's tight, but just right. i have no trouble with the buttons, at all. i am 5'4"" and it comes above my knee. the material is very quality and seems as it will last a very long time. i get complimented very often when i wear it.",pos
"The ivory color needs a little camisole or tank underneath. the sweater is beautifully knit and has a soft and nubby texture. hope it washes well. maybe size up if you want a looser, relaxed feel. hits me right around the hip bone and i am 5' 8"". can easily be dressed up or down with accessories.",pos
"This is the perfect lounge/sleep cami! i am 5'1'' 120 lbs and purchased the dark purple small. it's hangs a bit loose - my preferred fit for sleeping shirts. good quality, easy washing (machine/delicate), and cool and airy for hot summer nights.",pos
I love this t-shirt! it's a little bit dressy because of the lace but the t-shirt material is great for casual wear. i tried on the white but ended up buying the black because the white is so sheer. i'll still have to wear a layering tank with it but the black just feels less sheer for some reason. really cute and nice quality t-shirt!,pos
Soft! sleeve is cuffed! different. called moonscape. cool vibe. tiny threads on front of moon.,pos

I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.,pos

"Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.",neg
"I love the design and the fabric, but the fit is just off on this dress. the area around the bust is just not fitted well. the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat. that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress, but the waist also sat too high on me (maybe i'm long waisted, who knows?), so between the super high waist and the flannel-type fabric, it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me. i wish it weren't so. i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou",neg
"I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy, something you can wear everyday.",pos
"I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also, it's pretty short, and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.",neg
"I started stalking this dress when i saw it on a store's instagram feed, and i was so thrilled to get it in the mail. however, i ordered it before reviews started popping up, and i was concerned it would not fit in the bust. however, when it arrived, the fit is perfect. it's not exactly loose in the bust, but there also isn't any pilling. the high-waisted nature was also suited to my shape. i'm usually between a 4 and a 6, and the 6 was great in this dress, and a perfectly joyful length--appropr",pos

Crazy soft and comfy.  light weight so will be great for spring/ summer and layering.  so happy i bought it.,pos
"This dress is so fun and very comfy! the slip it comes with pulls the whole dress together! it has been great for warm fall days, but i can see it being warn with leggings and boots into the winter. i love the combination of blocked deep colors along side of pastels. i'm 5'5"" and the length is just right, not too short.",pos
"I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes, typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter, but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser, but doesn't look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down.",pos
"I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile, the top can't be too see through, it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size 2 and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.",pos
"Yes, it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft, the colors are great, and the hood, well, the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.",pos

fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull.

"I had such high hopes for this shirt! i got it in both the black and moss (which is a beautiful color). however, the ruffle was just too big. i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown. it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves, but on me, it was not flattering at all.",neg

"I've been looking for a staple long-sleeve tee for a while now, and i think i've found it! i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect. the material is soft, the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places. the sleeves are long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me. the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long. i'll be back for more colors!",pos

"I don't think it's possible to say enough good things about this dress! the fit is beautiful (i'm 5'6"", 130lbs, and am a 32h,) the material is soft and swishes around your legs in a delightful way, and the length has all the positives of a maxi dress without dragging on the ground. it doesn't show bra straps. it looks good with either heels or a trusty pair of birkenstocks. the pattern is fun. essentially, it's the perfect summer dress.",pos

"Great, easy to wear addition to the wardrobe. i wore it all day today and no pilling! plus the pockets are really convenient...they are a good depth for car keys or a small wallet. i'm pretty busty (32ddd) and have a curvy body...with that said, the small fit well. i prefer wearing it with the zippers opened because my behind and hips look odd with the sweater fully zipped...(for ref 36 inch hips). give this one a shot...it's a nice surprise.",pos
"Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!",pos
"This is huge. i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape. there is no shape to this and is a lot of material. i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses, sometimes medium in sweaters.
it seamed like 2 sizes too big. the material is very soft and the collar is nice. there is a ribbon tie at the waist. the tie is wimpy and could be nicer. when tied, there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist.",neg
"This is probably the softest, most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn. i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully. great for spring & summer, love it as a coverall at the beach. my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me. highly recommend.",pos
"I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!",pos
I love this top. i found it to be true to size. i usually wear a size large or extra large and the size large fit well. i really appreciate that the armholes are not gigantic and don't show underthings. i bought the navy/black and find that a navy cami works well under it. i like this with casual pants and jeans under an open front sweater for now and think it will be nice with a linen skirt or shorts in warmer weather. this is not a style i would usually wear but i found the two tone lace very,pos
Adorable peplum top! colors are much more rich in person. saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale. beautiful material and craftsmanship. i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase. highly recommend....great piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall.,pos
"The dress didn't look like much on the hanger but the rust color caught my attention so i tried. the dress fits beautifully. i did have to size down to a small because the medium was too large on my frame. i have a longer torso and the elastic waist did not quite fall on my natural waist, but corrected by pairing with an obi belt, which looks fantastic. the bottom is lined and flows rather nicely. the dress has a modified hi/low thing going where the front and back are longer than the sides, but",pos
This is perfection in the color sky. get you one now. you will not regret it. it is super soft and flattering!,pos
"I bought this as a ""reward."" i have wanted a leather jacket forever and i truly love this. goes with so many things; tons of compliments. soft, comfortable material.",pos
"This is the cutest poncho style sweater (but the arms aren't attached like a true poncho. it doesn't work for a petite customer, unfortunately, but on average sized it's gorgeous. so pretty.",pos
"Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 34 dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!",pos
"Great skirt, fits as expected. very cute, can be dressed up or down. i love the pockets!!",pos
"This dress is gorgeous. i bought it to wear to the ballet, and i know i will wear it to other formal events as well. it is really fancy---definitely wouldn't wear it to work! i had it hemmed as it was really long on me, and it is a bit tight in the shoulders. it has a beautiful shape and flows while you are walking---it felt pretty!",pos
"Gorgeous, but so big. i got eh pxs and it's like a mumu. i wiill return",neg
"When i put this skirt on my aunt said that looks like a skirt with class. she's right. this skirt feels as wonderful on as it looks. i love the faux leather slash, it is the perfect detail without detracting from a printed top. i think it is great to just slip on no zipper (for those days).i even pulled this on over a dress. bailey 44 hits it out of the park again. i have 3 dresses and now a skirt. t.e colors on the website are brighter than they are in person, just fyi.",pos
"This sweater was huge, it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy, it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s, and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick, i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame.......",neg
"I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back, since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight, and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable, even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold, i am sick of neon!!!!",pos
"I bought the black leggings and love how warm and comfy they are. i wore them with a tunic and boots to work, and people were surprised that they were leggings. the ribbing makes them nicer than plain black leggings. i want another pair, especially for the price!",pos
How i did not notice this dress for weeks i do not know. this is absolutely the best casual dress i've ever had the pleasure of owning and i hope my future includes acquiring the other sold out colors. i was fortunate enough to buy the holly in m and taupe in mp and they both fit well and look flattering on my unproportioned body. this dress goes well with many layers or on its own and is going to work for at least three seasons in my area. the drape of the willa complements my over large upper,pos
"The fit, the length, the color, the fabric... cannot say anything negative at all! the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in, and she could not wait to see how they looked on. they were just as awed as i was! the pants can easily be dressed up or down.. the brown color is so, so, beautiful! i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant.  i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come.",pos
"Let me just say that this material is awesome!!! when i first took it out of the packaging i was afraid that the top was too thick of a material but after wearing it around the house it seems light enough. (i live in a warm area). i will say that i find the top to be a bit larger. i ordered a medium in fear that the small would be too small on the bottom. i could have taken the small in the top---even though it is meant to be baggy 

 the bottoms on the medium fit me great- they shorts don't b",pos
These jeans are excellent! i've been looking for a boyfriend jean that has plenty of room without just looking too big and these are it. there's lots of give in the material but they still conform to your shape. i highly recommend!,pos
"I love the fabric and details of this dress!! i was thrilled to see it in person. i plan on wearing it when the weather gets colder because of the styling of the dress. i am choosing to keep the hem where it is, and thus prefer it as a ""colder months"" dress. the poppy flowers really ""pop"" in this dress- love!!",pos
The material is great!! got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one. everyone compliments them!,pos
"I wore this jumpsuit to a newport wedding and got so many compliments! i'm 5'2"" 105 lbs and the 0 petite was perfect with heels.",pos
"I recommend this dress for women wth a small bust. this is an absolutely gorgeous dress, but it runs very small through the bodice and is almost empire waisted. if you remember the coral dress from spring by the same designer, it fits the same but this one has a tiered skirt. so sad- i love this dress-the colors and design are beautiful.",pos
"I love how boho, colorful and comfy this dress is. sometimes you just want to wear your comfiest bra and not worry about a dress that doesn't cover the straps. they were out of the petite small so i went with the small. i am 5' 125 lbs, and it fits perfectly, just more of a midi length. no problemo!",pos
"I am 5'6"" and run between a size 9-10 pant. i ordered the size 10 skirt and the waist fit perfectly and so did the back of the skirt, which i was afraid might be loose (i don't really have a butt but it fits nicely). looks like the picture so the skirt goes straight down, it does not taper to smaller width like some regular pencil skirts might so the bottom part will not be fitted, for your reference. the denim actually has quite a lot of stretch so it's very comfortable as well as the waistband",pos
"After seeing this dress online i wanted to try it on and was not disappointed when i did. even though the coral color dress of the same style was pretty it wasn't the right color for me. i absolutely love the blue and white dress! i usually wear a size 8 but found the 6 was more flattering. i'm 5'2"" and the length was perfect - above the knee but not too high. love it!",pos
"I saw this a few months back and wanted it then and now i bought it. i missed a few promos but i ended up getting it at full price in a large, my usual size i like in the pilcro denim jacket line. i love pilcro and have several of this brands denim jackets and each one is very special. i love the use of the plaid details. it has a weathered appearance - the denim and my distressed treatments are not too severe, as some reviewers have commented on the ""holes"" . i will say this jacket runs small.",pos
"It stays on .... i mean off the shoulders. the price is shocking, love the low price, but by no means id cheap. really love this little beauty",pos
I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.,neg
"I love this top. the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy. the cut is fitted and flattering. the color of the fabric is ivory, not bright white. the embroidery is a good quality and doesn't easily fray. the fit is true to size. i highly recommend this top. i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute, always get compliments. it's very comfortable too.",pos
"I bought a 2p when i should've bought a 0p. i was swimming in the 2p. however, it didn't matter, because everything was itchy, and i'm not even allergic to wool. the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design, and just like other reviewers commented, you have to twist and contort them to get them to button...which, inevitably, will lead to them popping off. and i didn't see an extra one in case that happened. the coat is stunning, there's no argument about that, and i welcome",pos
I love this jumper!  it is absolutely gorgeous and also quite possibly the most comfortable piece of clothing i've ever owned.,pos
"The product looked more or less as expected, but the fabric felt very cheap. not the quality i would expect from retailer. the shirt is also very short, which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of.",neg
I was so excited to receive this in the mail. it fits true to size and is extremely flattering. so glad that i made this purchase,pos
"Omg - wish it came in more colors,,",pos
"This is the dress that i have been waiting for all season. perfect color. the material is also ""firm"" without being heavy or thick (if you know what i mean). it lays flat and smooths out any bumps without being overly stiff. the v-neck is also not too deep and the sleeves are not too short. overall, a complete win. now go and make it in gray and navy blue please.",pos
"This dress looks great online with boots as shown. when it arrived and i tried it on, it fit great on my arms, wasn't too tight on my neck, but once it went down over my chest (36c), the dress never came back ""in"" to show my feminine waist/shape. it just looked like a big trash bag on me, very disappointing! similar to a mumu.",neg
"I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps, which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern. however the embroidery takes away any stretchy-ness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but ill-fitting harness for anyone with any breasts or full-figured lusciousness. the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps, so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top. i wanted to keep this but h",neg
"I bought this dress last week for a wedding next summer. it did not appeal to me on the hanger, but once i tried it on, i was so impressed. the green color is lovely and it is lightweight and airy, and it does have a lining which is a plus. i love the little ruffle sleeves and the tie in the back is perfect. there have been comments about the hemline being awkward but the length on me was perfect and has just the right amount of flounce to be feminine. i can't wait to wear this dress! (i am 5'6""",pos
"Super soft and comfy, with stylish look",pos
"Saw this online and went in to try on. fit great and is true to size, but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread. i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought, better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps. well, literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam",neg
"I actually rather like this top, i ordered a size smaller than usual, based on how flowy it looks in the picture, and was quite pleased. the pink color is rich, and i love the cut work... it has a bit of a sparkle in it, and is very pretty and flattering on the back. it does swing out a lot, but i ended up half tucking it. the pink color is very nice. it is gauze material, so of course, it is thin. i usually buy 0 but this 00 was great. also, there was no petite in the pink, so can't comment on",pos
"I am a huge fan of cloth and stone tops as they are very versatile.
this particular one didn't disappoint. the combination of plaid and tie dye is so fun and fresh, yet the blue makes this piece an easy one to match with many bottoms.

now for the fit:
the cotton is very soft and lightweight.
i bought my normal size medium and it fits perfectly.

i look forward to wearing this piece often.",pos
"After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!",neg
"This jacket feels like a throw blanket, but has shape and is appropriate to wear both casually or dressed up to make it profession enough to wear to the office. the jacket is bias cut and longer in the back to cover your rear. since it's fleece, the sleeves roll up easily and you can move around in it with ease. it has pockets big enough to carry your phone. i'm 5'7"" 135 with a small chest and i got the jacket in my normal size small and it's loose enough for me to wear layers underneath. if i w",pos

I purchased this blouse for an easter brunch and couldn't be happier! the feminine/romantic print is a gorgeous addition to my spring wardrobe. i've paired it with a pencil skirt and heels for a dressier look as well as my favorite ag cuffed denim and sandals for a more casual daytime look.,pos
"I am 5'8"", broad shoulders,can sometimes wear a size 4 depending on the cut. i purchased the size 6 and was a true fit. just enough flow to give you room to move but not too much to make you look larger than you really are. the fabric us light and great quality. perfect for a summer night out. so happy with this purchase",pos
"This top will be great in 3 seasons. i can wear it alone in summer to dress up and with a blazer or sweater in fall and winter. the velvet is beautiful and luxurious without being excessive or too much. it's very soft and comfortable on the skin, although a little larger than i expected. i ordered my usual size small and probably should have gone down a size.",pos
"I never owned an 'older' version, so nothing to compare to.  i found it comfortable, stylish and warm on a cool fall day. the minor piling made it look more rustic, has not shed on any of my other clothes so far...",pos
"I tried on the regular size at my store (wish stores close to me carried petites), and it was jsut too overwhelming (aka big). i wanted to purcahse the petite, however, as i really like it (striked out as they are sold out in my size, bummer).

the cut is otherwise flattering, and the sweater is really comfortable. i like all the contrasting ""colors"" and patterns too.",pos
"I am a 10 m and got the 10. it fits perfectly and there is room in the bust (i'm 36/38 c). the shirt feels very nice and silky up to the skin. i'm just not sure about the print- i got the umbrellas. it's cute, but maybe a little too cartoonish? it does look good with a green or blue puffy vest for colder days...still trying to decide if i should keep or return, but only b/c of the print. i'd love this in some solid colors!",pos
"I love these jeans. at first, i was unsure of what shoes to wear with the length of the crop. i don't wear block high heels ( as pictured) everyday chasing after my boys. but once i figured out which shoes looked cute i was in heaven. the fit is very flattering and it will be a great jean for everyday fun!",pos
"I have athletic calves from running, so i really struggle with straight/skinny jeans. but these fit me just fine (and don't look like jeggings). i think the slit helps. i have a 29"" inseam and these hit just above the ankle. great find - especially on sale.",pos
"I just bought these jeans today & i absolutely love them!
i usually wear a 25 or 26 in any jean depending on the fit. i bought these in the 25 regular & they fit so perfect. they definitely are not a legging fit nor are they a baggy boyfriend style. on the tag these jeans are described as a girl fit - slim with a dash of ease. that describes the fit of these perfectly. they are not tight & not baggy at all, just a bit of ease - at least on me. i am 5' 5"" & the regular length is perfect. the fab",pos
"As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos, the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit, i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7"", 128# with a very small",pos

Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.,pos
"Beautifully constructed and designed, this lovely sweater coat from rosie neira makes me anticipate fall weather more than i should. the fit is perfect for light layering and has a feminine silhouette. the wool feels like all my other boiled wool pieces--it's soft, slightly itchy, but tolerable. i wear a layer anyway so i hardly notice. just be aware for those that are extra sensitive. i purchased size mp and my stats are 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35",pos
"These pants are as dreamy as linen but much more forgiving when worn all day. they fit true to size and are very flattering. i have 5 pair. they are my go to work pant that can be dressed up with an elegant tank if i have to run to dinner after work!

"I love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes. i bought a size small and the length was great, the fit was great, but the arm holes were gappy and big. i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise.",neg
This top is the perfect combo of function and flair! the style of the top makes it easy to wear and the back detail is just lovely. i love that it can be worn as either a buttoned-up top or a light over-shirt with a t-shirt or camisole underneath. i would pair this with blue or gray skinny jeans.,pos
"I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4"" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one, the length, the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also,",pos
I found this in the returned section of the store in a large. i am normally a m but the fit would have been too small in the shoulders. it is very light weight and the color is much lighter in person which means it will go right into spring!,pos
Love it - material is soft and color goes will with any color.,pos
"I'd been eyeing this dress since i first saw it in the dress catalog when it came out. when i saw it in person, it was just as beautiful as i remembered! i'm about 140 lbs and usually wear a size s or m, but i tried the s on and decided to size down to an xs, because the linen flowy fabric lays a bit wide when on the body; however, the s would have worked, too! i'd say size down if you prefer your clothes a tiny bit more fitted. the fabric is beautiful and lightweight, even though there is more",pos
This is the perfect throw on little blazer-like jacket that feels like a sweatshirt! i loved it so much (on sale) that i bought another one in a different color. i am 5'0'' and 115lbs and the xs fits like a glove. it is so great. well made. so comfortable. versatile. dress it up for work or down with a pair of jeans.,pos
Wish they had more colors avail in my size when i bought this one. you can easily dress it up or down.,pos
"I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn't have a lot of structure. it's soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it's just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i'm usually a 10/12 in tops.",neg
"Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.",pos
"Got this 4 days ago and have worn it 3 of those days. it is a perfect, beautiful autumn dress. the fabric is textured and slightly color-varied in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth. the fabric is a thin sweater knit -- because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does, nor would it be as figure-flattering. despite its thinness, it is still warm. would buy this in oth",pos
"I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!",neg
I pair this jacket with a black pencil skirt and it looks very put together. the embroidery is lovely and well done but the jacket would have been nicer with a polyester lining because it clings a little when you put it on. and it's an awfully heavy jacket for the summer. but overall i love it and how i look in it.  i think it runs true to size.,pos
This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!,pos

lots of colors to choose from. i have the washed blue and am thinking i need to get more colors!",pos
"I was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark! it isn't fitted but it doesn't look sloppy either. though it is comfy and is called a ""sweatshirt"" the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt. i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt.",pos
It's a great light jacket for early spring. ideal topper for jeans or denim skirt.,pos
"I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. i'm a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. i'm 32c-24-34. hope this helps!",pos
"Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun, not too flashy. a very warm hue, it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material, very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made, with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress, and the small fit beautifully, even with my large top. it is a stunner, that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments",pos

"I absolutely love cozy sweaters and this is my new fave. i love that it ties and it feels elegant. so much fun with jeans and one of my fun tees underneath. or with a skirt, boots and hat. love it. i wear it as i'm sipping my tea in front of my fire place writing my book. yes i'm writing a book. its a cozy writing a book sweater-that is it!! its perfect for that. on my white sheep skin cozy rug and my animal print chairs. i'm in heaven sipping my coffee in my cozy room with my cozy sweater.",pos
Great sweater - heavy without being too warm. great layering piece.,pos
"These jeans are the best. fit perfectly, so soft, comfortable, and look great on. i am in love. i put them on and did not want to take them off. i am 5'3"" and simply love the length for me. plus in my opinion the high waist is a s dream. so comfortable and really flatter my curves. these are pricey which is my only real complaint, but they are feeling worth it as i see myself wearing these a ton and the quality seems great, so i am thinking they will last a long time. don't hesitate to buy these",pos

This will be a cardigan i will wear across all seasons. if you want to layer a button down or another long sleeve shirt under it i would suggest sizing up one size. as soon as i put this on it felt like it molded to me. it's beautiful! and comfortable.,pos

pros:
- fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'9, 36c, hourglass. i'm normally a m or l (10 or 12) depending on the fit and found the medium to fit well and not be too tight at all. i could have probably sized down for a snugger fit, but i like the looseness. fit very well across the chest and arms.

"Love this top, dramatic in a casual way.
i ordered the teal and love love love it....with skinny jeans or leggings the style is perfect !
i am over 50, so the teal is gorgeous and i think very age appropriate.
i ordered the blue also, a very pretty shade of blue.........but felt in this style, the bright/light colors would be more appropriate for someone younger.
it's a stunning top...........and fits very true to size..........the drama of the ruffle is what sets it apart..
hoping they do",pos
Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now. and this one is more than i had hoped for.  in the store i was between a l and m.  so went with the large.  after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large.  jacket is roomy warm and so so soft.  added bonus w the hood.,pos

I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!,pos

Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha,neg

This is another item i've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available. i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didn't even try it on because i knew it would be going back. the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric. the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim. so much potential just executed poorly.,neg
"Love this dress. the description says ""pull over styling"" but it's not. there is a side zipper which i think makes for a better fit. i bought a 4 which fit great. i'm 5'4"" 125 lbs and it hits right above the knee.",pos
"Runs true to size for brand/retailer clothes (xs for 5'5"", ~120lbs), but a little tight in the shoulders/biceps if you have fairly developed muscles or just wide shoulders. watch out for the skirt riding up when you reach for something or bend over.",pos
"This shirt is adorable but it's really just a cotton t-shirt. based on the picture online, i thought it would have more weight, be a more substantial fabric. again, it's adorable but not sure how long it will last.",pos
Love the high rise and stretch of this jean- i feel long and lean which is tough for a short curvy girl! i feel these run a little small for pilcro- i went up a size.,pos
"I love this sweater. it's heavy, with a rich texture that feels like very cool grandma. the cut is straight, and the collar feels natural. a small wraps closed across my chest (usually a s/4/6) without being baggy. falls to my mid-calf at 5'6"".",pos
"Love wearing these, i see them getting a lot of wear in the winter",pos
I was hesitant to order this but i am really glad i did. it is just beautiful. the quality is excellent. i would like it to have more snaps so i am going to add them. i can't wait to wear it.,pos

I love ag jeans and these are fabulous! i can't say enough about how well ag jeans fit and hold up over time. i have several pair. i purchased the royal blue color in the store. they held their shape all day and were super comfy. i decided to purchased two more pairs with the online sale because i know i will be wearing these for a long time.,pos
"I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands. and both look great! there is no significant difference except medium fell about 1 inch longer. i am 5'4"" and size small hem fell about 1"" above knee. size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so i'm keeping size small. what a beautiful dress! although the body of dress is jersey material, it is lined so there is good coverage. i tend to not like ""faux leather"" since they",pos

"I bought this dress in-store, and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large, and i bought a large because it was the one available, and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams, which is obviously not ideal, but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.",pos
"Very warm and snuggly, gorgeous color, nice fit. i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right, but managed so it works for work. i can't say enough how toasty it is. very good quality and styling.",pos
This fit me perfectly. i'm petite and it is a little long but i like the length. it's perfect! so cute,pos
Fit great and cute. cannot wait for summer to wear with sandals.,pos

"Cute tee. it's a casual tee with some nice detailing that gives it some style. the fabric is a good thickness. not see-through thin but light enough for warm weather. the color should match pretty much anything. nice neckline. i think it runs slightly large. i hover between a small, extra small with tops and the xs fit nicely. i do have narrow shoulders, 32dd, so women with normal to wide shoulders might prefer their usual size. i don't expect people to gush over it with compliments but it it a",pos
"I almost passed this in the store, but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a ""blouse"" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that don't need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker, so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room.",pos
"Great casual jacket! it's a nice spring weight, can be worn in different ways by turning the cuffs, folding the collar, wrapping or unwrapping, etc. i love the way they styled it in the model shots. i am going to have to disagree with the other reviewers about this being tts. i have to say the medium was so oversized, it looked like i was wearing a fabric box. i have a broad back and 36ddd bust and am comfortably wearing the size xs.",pos
Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!,pos
"As soon as my eyes touched these pants i knew my body had to. not only doo they look great, they feel great. the material is very soft with just enough stretch. they've quickly become my favorites. i loved the first pair so much i immediately bought the other color.",pos
"Love this top, looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans. it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing. it is short, so for me the high waist pants were a must, but if you don't mind showing your belly, then it would be cute with anything, the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some. overall it was a good fit.",pos
"First of all a caveat, i am not curvy at all. i am average height but petite in terms of features and bones and such. specifically, i am 5 feet 6 inches tall and about 123 pounds and boyishly shaped with a feminine and timeless style. all this means that i can get overwhelmed by dresses/clothes with a lot of fabric or large prints and such. if you are shaped like me, this dress will be perfect for you! it highlights your advantages (slim and petite) and give you curves (that i wish i had natural",pos
"I love this top, it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who don't normally wear sleeveless tops. i think it runs very large - i'm normally a size s/m and the extra small was right. it's loose around the waist yet has a feminine fit.the tiny balls around the neck, button at the back, flutter sleeves, and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique. i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve.",pos
"Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on",pos
"This vest goes with literally everything. it is the perfect amount of added warmth - though it's a bit hard to fit under a coat. the only thing i will say negatively about it is that it seems to shed on the inside a bit... but otherwise the quality, color, and length are perfect. and i love the pockets!",pos
"I have a different perspective than the other reviewers. the fabric is thin - and silky -perfect for summer! it is a pleasant change from other items in my summer closet. i bought the small, which i typically wear. it can easily be dressed up with heels and down with flat sandals. finally, it has pockets!!!!",pos
Gorgeous dress worth every penny--one of a kind twist on a kimono!,pos
"Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!",pos
"This is a beautiful dress for fall. the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy. i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first. i think a l might fit a bit better, so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare. it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit. it is also very long, i need to hem it about 3-4"". i never know which size to order with this brand, i vary between l and xl.",pos
"I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile, i'm looking forward to wearing these!",pos
This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep. wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath.,pos

"Wearing this to a weeding in july. its so feminine and pretty. runs a little big on top at the arm holes, but having it tailored - love!!!!",pos
This dress is lovely and easy to wear if you are short and you buy regular size (not petite). i am 5'1 and i bought the regular medium so the length of the front falls just above my knees. i can wear it to work without leggings. the other thing i love is it has pockets! and it fits generously - i weigh 140 lbs and will usually fit in a medium (if i don't breathe) and a large (if i use a belt). but in this size (medium regular - i can breathe! and i need a belt. ergo - i don't feel like i need to,pos
Definitely a good buy especially when i bought it on sale! it's warm and can be worn dressed up or down.,pos
I absolutely love this jacket! i wear it almost everyday. works as a cardigan or a jacket. my favorite retailer purchase so far:),pos
"I love the color patterns and fabric.  it has full lining!  my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style - makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering?  a straight (shift) style would have been much better.  dress runs large, however the arm/shoulder area is tight.",neg
Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type. also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me.,neg
I absolutely love this dress! the pictures don't do it justice. the colors and details are stunning! i have only worn it once this far but received a ton of complements.,pos
"Great peplum top, beautiful whine color. very thick material. i'm hourglass figure, 36d top so it was very flattering",pos
"The back of this top is very unique and the embroidery looked like it would hold up.
it does have a boxy shape, but it really works with this piece. i found it to run true to size compared to other pieces i have from retailer. for some reference, i'm 5'5"" and weigh 148lbs.",pos
I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.,pos
"I just received this beautiful suit. i have purchased a boyleg from seafolly before and loved it!
this color way is totally different. it is a white background with a floral pattern that is not over the top.

my sister is a 34 b size 4 clothing and it fit as well.
way to go retailer with another winner!!!!",pos
"My daughter got this dress in the 10 and i got it in the 6 - we are both tall. also, she's a redhead and got the butterfly version and i'm blonde and got the pink. also, both of us are small-chested - and since there is no give in the fabric, i don't know where one would fit boobs if you have them. one thing i noted (and i am not happy about) is that the back is puckered up along the zipper. this has to be on purpose, and i don't really understand that detail, as it doesn't flatter me and it loo",pos
"Great dramatic cardigan, wearable art, and not for the meek. i'll wear with a leather skirt and boots, jeans and boots, or a dress and boots. if the lack of closure at top bothers you, attach something --be creative. i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn.",pos
"I was so excited to get the dress, it's extremely beautiful and comfortable. the size i picked was unfortunately too big for me though, i just had a baby so it's hard to figure out what size i am now..details were exquisite.",pos
"I am always on the hunt for a white shirt that is not too sheer, so that i can wear it without a cami underneath. on that count, this top is a winner!
regarding the fit, it is a shorter top, so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people. i am short waisted, and i wouldn't be able to tuck it in.
in fact, i think it is really meant to have an almost cropped fit.
fyi: 36c (34d), broad shoulders/back, short waist - in a fitted shirt i take a 10/12, but i tried this",pos
"This color is perfect: deep and rich. it is exactly as it looks on-line. the velvet is super-soft on the outside, while the inside is more of a woven finish. it makes it a little less cozy, but the drape is great. the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest, and full everywhere else. the waist is lower in the back than the front, so it sits lower on the hip. i'm 5'4, 140, 34b, and i got a small petite, because i liked where it hit my waist better. this means i won't be wearing it without tigh",pos
"I bought this dress for my college graduation, and it's truly gorgeous! i love the loose, breezy fit, but it did feel just a little bit sack-like on me, definitely more-so than i expected from looking at the product picture, even after sizing down to a small (which was comfortable, and i'm usually a medium). i ended up pairing it with a small belt. 

really pretty dress, just be advised - leaves a *lot* of room around the waist!",pos
"I got the blue with polka dots. it fits more like a midi dress. it is a bit large, i'm usually a size 10 and got a size 8. it's gorgeous on. i don't think i'll be needing a bra underneath this. it's got a supportive band and the ribbon also helps. i might order the other bold print too, it just looks so good on.",pos
I came into the store to try another dress on and was given this dress to try. it is perfect! i paired it with black tights and tall boots for a family photo. i got it in the wine color. highly recommend and very fun for winter. it does run really large. i usually wear a small but got an extra small.,pos
"I fell in love with this top on the spot and paid full price for it, which is a rarity, since everything goes on sale. it's a beautify top, well made and sits well on me. i am 5'6"", usually wear a size 10 but got away with an 8 in this one. i do have short torso, so i can see it having a problem for someone with long torso or someone who's tall. what's even better is that it went on sale and the store was nice enough to give me the difference back. i'm thinking about getting the other two colors",pos
"To my surprise this sweater is heavy, chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater.",pos
I love this dress!  i originally ordered it in a small but returned it for an extra small.  it fits perfectly - love the details.  so classic and comfortable !,pos
This is seriously a beautiful dress. it has such gorgeous colors. it's lined so no slip needed. it is flowy and just the right length. i went with a petite and it is perfect.. can't wait to use it at the beach.,pos
"The quality of he fabric is amazing. the thickness is perfect as to look form fitting while not too tight or thin showing any ""wrinkles."" i had been searching for a versatile turtleneck i could dress up or down a finding this was a definite win! the style is timeless and with the high quality i know this will be a staple for years to come.",pos
"Perfect semi-dressy summer top, that could definitely go year round. love the buttons up the back. it's flows but the slight peplum keeps it from looking tent like. love this so much i ordered another in black.",pos
"I loved this dress before putting it on, but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type. it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for. sadly this will be going back. i loved the print and the feel of the material. just not a flattering cut for me.",neg

looks good with navy tights too!",pos
Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed,neg
Got this in the pretty springy blue already wore it with white jeans and loved it!! love the loose longer swingy style and i can't wait to wear again! i may have to get another color!,pos
I thought this dress was lovely on. i'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale.,pos
"I can't get over how fabulous this looks on, how well it fits, and how flattering it is. i'm 5'8"" and size 8/10 on a good day. seriously - i'm so happy about it ! i plan to get a lot of wear out of it - works for a wedding, evening out, or the office.",pos
This fits like a dream! the almost three quarter length sleeves are perfection. worth every penny!,pos
The larkspur tank is colorful and the embroidered bib is beautiful. the material is soft but not diaphanous. it can hide my little pouch without looking like maternity clothing. love it!,pos
"Great shirt that runs true to size. i got the turqouise color which is very pretty. it cuts lower, but doesn't show much cleavage.",pos
"I love this top! it's very delicate and pretty. flattering cut. the fabric is sheer, so wear with a cami or a pretty bra.",pos
"I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other",pos
I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.,pos
"I love this blazer. its perfect for work, and makes a great statement.",pos
"I was worried about ordering this top after the first review, but i was very pleasantly surprised. the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel, and a lighter weight knit on the back panel, which gives it a ""flowy"" quality. it looks slender and trim in front, with the unexpected surprise in back. the transition between the front and back panels is well done, which doesn't really show in the photos. i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on it's uniqueness the first time i wor",pos

"The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on. 

as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.",pos
"I bought this suit based on the great reviews. i was so bummed when i tried it on. the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up. my torso is on the longer side so maybe that's why the bottoms keep coming up. every time i pulled the shorts down, the top would come down too, and vice versa. i am 5'5 and 120lbs and bought a 2 which is my normal size. i did like that the top had a bit of padding but that's the extent of what i liked about it. i will be returning it.",neg
"I think this sweater is well executed for what it is--a chunky knit trapeze sweater. i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online, but it caught my eye in person. there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store. the interwoven peachy, heathery color is sweet and flattering. since i'm 5'1"", i ordered had the petite version to try. hope it works out 'cuz i'm eager to own something relaxed and cozy that's actually flattering and isn't a sweatshirt.",pos
"I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it...""classic,"" ""fancy,"" ""jackie o."" are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e",pos

I love this shirt and the colors it brings out. this shirt makes a great statement. it can be worn with jeans and look great or worn with slacks. i great a lot of compliments.,pos

"I tried this on at the store and am coming online to order it in petite. i'm 5'1"" and the length hit me just below the knee in the regular length so i'm hoping it will hit just above the knee in petite. it was very cute, might run a bit large but basically true to size. size down if between sizes. it has a little bit of sparkle beading around the neck which is nice.",pos
"I absolutely love this light, soft cardigan. i don't think the pic does it justice. the black longer blouse takes away from it. i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments. only wish it came in additional colors.",pos
"I bought this dress in an xs, and am 5'4"", 115 lbs, and fairly proportional. the shoulders were snug, but the hips (and maybe waist)were at least 2-3x too big. comically so-- the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side.",neg

"This caught my eye in the store last week, and i decided to try it on. it's the perfect lightweight jacket. the photos here show it as activewear, but i think the details on it allow it to be much more versatile. it's very flattering and i found it to run true to size.",pos
"I liked this dress but wasn't sure about the color on me. i tried it on anyway. originally, i tried on the 0, but it seemed big so i ordered the 00. also usually i order petite, but this dress is already short (and i am not getting younger), so i went with regular size this time. color was not bad on my pale skin, i think the hue was ok (surprisingly). one thing that might bug the perfectionist in me, the zig zag isn't always aligned, the waist, for instance was crooked, but if it is like that e",pos
"Wearing these for the first time today. the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be. the fabric is gorgeous; the fit is excellent. the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern. the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch. true to size, too. these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants - they're something special and worth the money...the fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase",pos
Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top. it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape. perfect for summer!,pos

I love this top! the fit is perfect and i particularly like the longer back. there is a split between the shorter front and longer back which is brilliant so you can move and sit without it pulling around your bum. looks great with skinny jeans or with leggings. it is very light weight and is perfect for spring. the sleeves are slightly fitted and very comfortable. the quality and construction is great. i am 5 feet and got a petite xs which is perfect.,pos

"I really love the idea behind this. however, the fit doesn't work for me. i'm usually a s or xs in retailer tops, and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops. this one runs small though - the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width. the neckline was very high (higher than it looks in the model photo) and the armholes were too big. so i don't think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue. the other criticism is that the front is not lined.",neg
"I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans, khaki shorts, and camo pedal pushers. added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top. i'm loving that it shows off my shoulders (they're tan from my vacation and i've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym). it's well made too!",pos
"I stared at this dress for a long time online and finally went into the store and tried it on. it is a beautiful quality and material. note that it is ivory, not pure white, which is exactly what i was looking for. the fit is more of an a-line and it is slightly long which is part of the style of the dress. i am taking it with me to a beach vacation in mexico but i plan to wear to many more occasions because this could easily be dressed up or down. just don't wear it to a wedding since it is a w",pos
"All of my friends loved these pants- as did i! these are so gorgeous. the sequins seem well stitched. the small fit me well- hanging straight as pictured, not too snug or uncomfortable. they hit me at the ankle. there are back pockets.",pos
The fabric is super soft and litght. it hardly feels like you are wearing it. body skimming fit can disguise a less than perfect figure. can easily go from day to night. absolutely love.,pos
This skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large. i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace. great find.,pos
"This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!",pos
"These would have been the perfect black pants! great cut, love the wide band in the front, true to size, quality construction. but a zipper in the back?!!! i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up. perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller, but the pants fit perfectly - they were just too hard to put on. sending them back, since i don't have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need.",neg
This dress is wonderful. fits perfect. very comfortable. wonderful colors.,pos
"I purchased this tee in the blue and it is so very cute. its such a soft thin tee and a delight to wear on these hot summer days. i went with xs on this one and i still have plenty of room.. i have paired it with jean shorts, capris and it goes really well with the pilcro hypen chino shorts.",pos
"Interestingly, the description said this was blue, but as it looks on the picture, it is more grey. that being said, about the zippie: love. my stylist (i brought it in for a try on session at my local store), said, ""you know how i feel about sweats, i won't like it""... joke on her, she turned around and was ok, i shouldn't have looked, love the ruffles at the bottom...it makes this ""sweater"" much more special. it is actually really cute for casual day, jeans t-shirt, kids... or over sweats. any",pos
This shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures. i love the fit and felt great in it on a mom's night out with jeans and heals. i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about! love it!,pos
"Long-time ag jeans fan. lately though, i'm finding the material is much too stretchy. i wanted a good pair of jeans. if i wanted pajama jeans, i would've ordered them. i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered (same review there).
so back both pairs went. 
it's a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted. if only they had been made out of actual jeans material.",neg
"These pants are super comfy and fit true to size. i went up to a size large because i wanted them extra roomy and longer. i'm 5'10"" and 140lbs and generally wear a size 6-8 in pants. i highly recommend them for stylish and comfy lounge pants!",pos
I tried this on at the store - the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it. the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft. it does run on the big and flowy side. i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out. i'll snap it up if it goes on sale.,pos
"Great top - i have both colors. because the front is 'short' i ordered a medium. i usually wear a small. if you are not long waisted, like me, order the small.",pos
"I bought this coat shortly after christmas and am in love. it is meant to fit oversize but runs true to your natural sizing. i am a m/l in most retailer clothing and that is what i bought. it is great for layering for a dressed up look with a skirt or dress for work and also dressed down with jeans a t-shirt. and, although the arms are 3/4 length it is super warm! so happy i purchased!",pos
The shoulder bearing aspect makes this top sexy yet it doesn't look like you're trying too hard. sleeves can be worn up or down and everything stayed in place either way. i get tons of compliments each time i wear this.,pos
"Flattering, comfortable, and a fantastically versatile color and style. if you'd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model, i'd say that it's tts. the picture represents the color accurately - is a very dark, slate grey. i've found that the color is a great neutral - i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors, as featured on the model. the style is also really versatile - i can wear it as a stand-alone t-shirt, or under a blazer to work.

"This top is adorable. normally wear small or xs but got xxs based on reviews, and glad i did. still really loose but so cute. would have preferred petite but sold out.",pos
"I was pleasantly surprised by how well this dress skims over the body. definitely needs the belt that comes with the dress to add some shape. the color is gorgeous, great print and very light fabric - perfect for summer.",pos
The fit on these is amazing and the color is great too! sometimes the fading is too much on jeans but this is just right. the rise fits really well and the length is great! love pilcro!,pos
This skirt is beautiful! the green really pops and makes the skirt stand out. it runs true to size. definitely a great addition to your wardrobe.,pos
"I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion, it isn't too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits, so it's perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it's flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color, there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction, so this adds some additional visual appeal. i haven't had any problems with snagging",pos
This top has so many details. i love the material. it adds a little formal to the casual jean. i am waiting to wear this come fall weather with slim jeans and some boots. it gives me that old victorian vibe without being still and formal.,pos
"This dress hits flatters the whole body. love the three quarter sleeves, love the relaxed fit of the bottom half. love how it is fitted, body conscious around bust. super flattering. the teal color is particularly gorgeous. a color that would suit a lot of different skin tones. this is a no-brainer dress that you will reach for in your closet every single time.",pos
"I saw this dress couple weeks ago and i really liked its color. the dress was ok untill i wore it. well. it's one of those dresses which are not great on hanger but great on you. well, the color is awesome, matches with other bright colors, mustard yellow, wine or black. the material is very thin so if you put size down it will fit but make sure that you see yourself in the mirror and see your back; i saw many ladies which put the dress which fits them but it does not fit the way it supposed to",pos
"Drapes very nicely and runs true to size. easy to wear alone or layer a jacket/cardigan over. i purchased this on sale, and it was a good buy. i am 5'8"" and purchased the size m, as i am a pretty true size 6.",pos
"In retailer's defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un",pos
"This shirt was exactly what i was looking for. it's fitted at the top with just the right amount of swing. some of retailer's shirts can have too much swing for me, but this is just right. the color is great too!",pos
"I love this jacket, but in contrast to the other reviewers find it to run a little small. i usually wear a small at retailer and got a size medium as the small was a little tight under the armpits. this might be because i have a large chest, but i wanted more room in case i want to layer.",pos
Should've ordered a larger size. it runs a bit tight around the top and the zipper isn't that helpful.,pos
"I wanted so much to love this dress, but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it. the color of the dress (green) was lovely, and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much. i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large; but even at that size the dress was too large, especially around the hips (which, for someone with an hourglass figure, is saying a lot!). the extra fabric around the hips belled out some, making",neg
"I ordered the 0p, in red and love these pants. the only problem is even in petites, these are long on me (maybe ok with 4 inch heels). the cut is comfortable and flattering, i have muscular thighs and these fall nicely on me. the color is also nice for this fall. i purchased last year's version (grey and turquoise, but reverse from what is offered this year) and they are very comparable (although i bought them too big last year). fabric not prone to easy wrinkling, highly recommend.

This skirt is amazing! it has the right amount of sparkle and the right amount of shape. i bought this in a size six which i can really switch between 6 and 8 depending but the six fits perfectly. i also bought the regular length even though i could probably be considered petite but it ended up being perfect. but the skirt is so lovely in person and has just enough wow that you can wear this thing with a simple tee and still look amazing. i wore this to a party with a black high neck tank and re,pos

"Very feminine! comes with a coordinating cami. i liked it so much that i'm going to order the other color, too!",pos
This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!,pos
"I just received my back-ordered wildberry top in blue. it's not blue but instead a dull, mottled purplish hue. it looks like a well-worn, stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom. so disappointing. it's going back for sure.",neg
"I highly recommend this dress!!!!!! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static, but nothing that a little static guard couldn't prevent! :) i purchased a medium petite and i am about 5 feet tall, usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect! (wore for thanksgiving) the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk, which i love!!",pos
This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.,pos
"I was hesitant about buying this at first because i'm busty (f-cup), but i love this top and have received a lot of compliments on it. and then i tried it on again at home with leggings and loved it. it's a great spring time top to wear with leggings and boots.",pos
Wow this is a keeper. love how soft and special the color feels. the knit for back and arms makes it very comfy and easy to wear. not really easy to layer it since arms pretty fitted. love it with jeans since the back ends at waist.,pos
"Oh dear. the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for me--it made it look so cheap. i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip. instead, it's a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic. it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist, making it a no-go for me.",neg
"This shirt is soft, long and is the perfect pair for leggings. i am only 5 ft. tall so this is extra long on me in the front and back! i bought it in 3 colors and hope to get more. i bought a large and love how it covers/hides my trouble areas!",pos
"I was so sad not to love this dress. it is beautiful, but is so unflattering on. there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking. so, it just made me look incredibly frumpy. i don't really think a petite would have helped - the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang, the dress sort of clumps. i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem, but i was super disappointed. narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off. it is a t",neg
"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.",pos
"Purchased this sweater in an xs, grey pattern (for reference, 5'4"", small frame) and was worried it would be too overwhelming. this is not the case! the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right. it seems to be true to size. i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves. it's a little pricey, but i think it will be worth it because it is so different!",pos
"I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes, polka dots and sweet flowers.",pos
"This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.",neg
Very flattering cut.  very loose & flowy.  runs a little big for a small but fits well for someone who sometimes fits medium depending on the cut.  i need to wear a bralette with this top.,pos
I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.,neg
I was so excited to get these. i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large . sadly they did not fit. i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case. i'm very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size. they are super cute from someone skinny.,neg
"Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow, is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!",pos
This top is comfortable and vas easily be dressed up or down! love it,pos
"This dress is beautifully tailored and so flattering. i feel very comfortable wearing it to work because of the sleeves and neckline, but think it would also be good to wear out. i'm so happy i bought it.",pos
"Great fit. colors look just like the pic. not too heavy but, warm and cozy.",pos
"This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.",neg
"This dress is amazing. i bought it for an afternoon wedding i'm attending, it's perfect! it fits like a glove and the lace is so delicate. the nude sheath really allows the lace and all the details to stand out. love it in the black!",pos
"I was not so sure i would like this dress as i was afraid it may be too boxy looking. per other reviews i took a chance...i love it!
so sweet with my grey boots and just dressy enough...but still casual and fun.
detail work is very nicely done.",pos
Beautiful dress that is very flattering! wearing it to my bridal shower.  more appropriate for spring or summer!,pos
Top of the line! very well made and on sale to boot. i love the style and received a compliment from my sister when i wore it. i love the layered look.,pos
This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.,pos
"This shirt is amazing! it's an excellent heavier weight quality t-shirt, but so comfortable. if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fall/winter/spring, this is it! i am 5'8"" 136 lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly. the band around the wrist is a nice touch, making this a higher quality tee. i am buying more colors.",pos
It's a soft comfy fabric... cute ruffle... may be a little on the bigger side but still super cute! very form fitting but still fits true to size imo the olive color is even more beautiful in person!,pos
"Really cute everyday dress. love the fabric and material, it's super soft. a great dress to just throw on and go.",pos
"Beautiful tee and cut with a classic, simple silhouette. nice weight and true to size. i'm 5'7"", 132# and the small fits me like i like. not tight at all, with room to allow for shrinkage. i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little self-conscious in due to the low cut neck. maybe if i weren't as small chested this wouldn't be an issue for me. i definitely recommend this tee.",pos
"Loved it as soon as i opened the box--it's a light-to-medium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front. i wasn't sure about the flowers online, but like 'em! the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the v-neck back is an unexpected addition. this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall. can't wait for the weather to cool down!",pos
This t is very cute and comfortable. could be worn casually or dressed up a little bit with jeans.very cute pattern on the shoulder area. love this top!,pos

This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt.,pos
"This top is tight across the bust (i am a 32dd cup) and more trapeze-shaped than the picture shows. if you are smaller busted, it may not flare out as much.
also- the sz 10 is what was tight - and i usually wear a sz. 4 or 6, or small-size top/blouse.
in the end, this wasn't very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top.",neg
"I fell in love with this skirt at the store, but was concerned i wouldn't have enough to wear with it. i ended up purchasing it online and when it arrived found that it goes with so many things. black turtleneck as pictured, navy blue blouse with bird print, white t-shirt, white blouse, the options are endless. fits true to size. too short to wear to work but will be perfect for spring and summer weekends. can't wait for the weather to warm up.",pos
Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.,pos
"This dress is beautifully constructed. it is very fitted and does run on the small side. it will be a perfect derby dress. the lace is lovely and the pearl buttons are great touch. age appropriate for anyone..a very 
pretty dress. simple, classic and gorgeous!",pos
"I like this layer for fall for many reasons. first of all, the color is a beautiful fall color. the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings. the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather. it is not too heavy, it's fairly lightweight. i am a size 6 and the small fit perfectly.",pos
"I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops. the fabric is heavier, so it is not good for hot weather. the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors - you can see if you zoom in, so it has an interesting texture. very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy.",pos
I love these pants. i have worn them a number of times already this season. i am 5' so i did have to have them hemmed. i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i don't think they look odd. i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps. a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks!,pos
"This is a gorgeous, well-fitting top! i was hesitant to even try it on because i was sure it would require a strapless bra, which i avoid. nope. worked perfect with my nude bra. i am 32d so need a real bra, but wore an unlined, underwire bra with no show through. great with denim shorts or more polished with dressy pants or dark jeans.",pos
"I love this top! from the details on the cuffs to the draping at the neck to the light-weight, yet very high-quality material, this top is my new winter-spring transition piece. i'm 5'3"", small chest, and a slight curve in the hips. the arms of this top fit me fine, but because the fabric doesn't stretch, you may find the sleeves too fitted. the length is perfect for hiding the butt without looking like pajamas (about mid-thigh). i've paired it with cuffed jeans and sneakers (like the model is w",pos

"I had purchased the black color of this sweater at full price and loved it so much that when i saw the burgundy color go on sale i knew i had to have it! this sweater is very comfortable and elevates any look with its lace down the sleeve, mock neck collar, and slightly flared silhouette. it's so fun to find different shirts to wear underneath to get a whole new look. highly recommend, would have gotten all colors!",pos
I purchased this sweater online and it's amazing. styling with jeans is nice but to me dark navy pants works the best.,pos
"I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9"" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is",pos
"I found this top in my local store. there were two colors available, this coral color and a deep teal color. i purchased the teal in a m, which is one size down from my normal size. it drapes beautifully. it is a tunic length, but not too long. i love the way it makes my shoulders look. i have athletic shoulders, and halter styles are best in the summer for me. this tank will require a strapless bra, i plan to wear a bandeau but i am not very big up top. anyhow, love this top. if it gets release",pos
Love these! they are thick and comfortable. they feel like sweat pants but are cute enough to wear out if you are running quick errands. definitely recommend!,pos

"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod",pos
I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!,pos
"Material is thin, with a fleece like feeling on the inside. hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material. the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward, shows way too much, would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath.",neg
Fits true to size with good coverage. stayed put when i was in the pool.,pos
"I was hesitant to try this top on because i thought it might be too tight, and then was delighted to find that it is so comfortable and flattering. i am usually a m and the m fit me great. i have to disagree with another reviewer that this top is for those of us b cup or smaller. i am a d and it fit me great. it's got enough give and support (great fabric and wrap design) to fit a wide range of bust lines. it's a great blend of being attractive without being too revealing. i love it. got it in b",pos

I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.,neg
I get so many compliments when i wear this... colors are great and print is unique. perfect for fall.,pos
"Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s",neg

"This is a beautiful cardigan. its effortless, lightweight, with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish. the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print. i wanted to love this...the detail, the length, the weight and the color are all so dreamy...but for me, the arms were super tight. normally i'm a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweaters...and i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping. i couldn't even get the cardigan on my arms. there is no s",pos
"This dress is wonderful. wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed, lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across, and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection, making it look super-tiny. the design is simple but very clever--it's feminine, flattering, and slimming. my only quibble is that it's quite long (and i'm almost 5'7"" in my stocking feet)...i will have to wear heels or have it hemmed. highly recommend.",pos
"This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive, it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value, is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and, in addition to looking great does keep you warm.",pos

"This is a beautiful spring/summer dress, and the quality of the materials is great. i wanted to love it. but the sizing is ridiculous! i'm 5'3"" and 115 and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs. while the pictures of the model in the dress don't suggest it has a shapeless cut, it definitely looked like a sack on me. a sack with a lovely print, but still an ill-fitting sack.",neg
"I have been looking for a long jacket with personality for a while now. i got one from retailer 5 years ago and i've been looking for something just as great. walked into the store and fell absolutely in love. the fit is true to size, i prefer my jackets pretty fitted. the color seemed a bit rosey in the store, but now that i'm home seems more tan and brown. it's not going to be super warm, perfect for fall in colorado and warmer winter days. it's soft, so soft, not bulky at all. if this is your s",pos

buy it, it's worth it especially with the sale price right now.",pos
"It's amazing!

i did size down on this one, but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area, but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem, but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my",pos

"I drooled over this dress online, so couldn't pass up trying it on at my local retailer store. while i loved the unique color in person, & the drape of the skirt (good quality, fully lines), i was so disappointed with the top of this dress! it's very tight, ill-fitting, & just plain...weird. i can't imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone, regardless of chest size. it's a shame, because otherwise, the dress is adorable!",neg
"I purchased this dress on super sale and i'm so happy i did. it looks better on me than on the model and that's never the case. the material is soft corduroy with comfortable give. it moves with me. true to size (i ordered a size 8 and for reference, i'm 5'2"", 140lbs, 36c). love this staple fall/winter piece. i wore it to a conference for work with footless tights and a black cardigan. i can't say enough how comfortable it is on! it has a structured give if that makes any sense. love it!",pos
This is so cute with a shirt or tee under neath. the look is better with a shirt underneath. very adorable for many occassions. i ordered the petite sizing b/c i like my pants more cropped.,pos
Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.,neg

"First of all, this dress is not cotton. it is 100% silk. it also not a pullover dress (it has a side zipper) and does not have an elastic waist like the description says. lastly, it is not by moulinette souers. i've really never seen a description so far off on one of the items pictured. nevertheless, it is a gorgeous dress. the silk is beautiful and can easily be worn for fall with a sweater or jacket. the waist is a little poofy and the chest is a bit snug. however, i was able to go down a siz",pos

Went to the local store today for something else and left with this in the cream color. it is just simply awesome. i could have worn the s but felt that the m would be a little better. i'm between a s and m most of the time. can't say enough good things about the quality and versatility of this sweater. great piece for cooler summer nights and for a cover up for pilates/yoga. can't wait to wear it and now i'm tempted by the teal.,pos
"Great little shift dress! for me it seemed to run true to size. i'm 5' 4.5"" and curvy. the regular size 10 fit perfect, about 3"" above the knee. a really fun design with the fringe. can't wait to wear once the snow is completely gone.",pos
"This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5"".",pos

My expectations were blown away in the best way when i tried on this top.  i typically have issues with button-downs in the chest area (buttons never lay flat) and this top lays perfectly.  the material is super soft.  looks great buttoned all the way up or with a few buttons left open.  i can't wait to wear with a pair of black high-waisted jeans this fall!,pos

I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.,pos
"Really cute top! love the ruffle detailing and the pattern. quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer. either way, i'm happy with the top. got my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it's meant to be a looser top so i don't mind that it runs a little bigger.",pos
"I like the look and fit of this shirt. can be dressed up or more casual. i got the purple motif, although i also like the brown and think that with all of the black in there (on the brown one) it would give a dressier look. i usually wear small from retailer, although this is my first blouse from this brand -- ended up getting an xs regular. i wanted the sleeves to fit at 3/4 as shown in the pics, but still be loose. i had a ton of extra room in the small, and the sleeves hit at wrist bone",pos

"From quality, to design, and overall comfort...these leggings have it all. they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on. i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing. it's just enough to add a little something. i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black! for the price it's more than worth it.",pos

"This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work, to a bbq, or to happy hour. i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely. the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model.",pos
Great as a beach coverup. i paired it with a slip underneath and a belt and it looks amazing! can't wait to wear it on the beaches of the bahamas soon!,pos
"This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r",neg

"This top is spectacular. intense and color soaked. i got bleu. super stretchy and comfy. the twisty part hugs and emphasizes your curves...even size 34a like me. the v neck is not too wide and low cut. it is narrower, close fitting and attractive. the seam in the middle thorax is a tad strange but it needs to exist due to the twist design. overall this top is cute, long and let's say men and women of all ages will enjoy it. it will make you beautiful on the outside and inside. it is not my usual",pos
"When i saw these in the store i liked how they were different from usual leggings and, the nice fabric weight. i especially liked how they were not tight at the ankle and fit similar to a pair of ankle pants. since i wanted a slightly looser fit, i usually wear a 2/4 i went w a medium. can't wait for the weather to get colder so i can wear them with a sweater and ankle boots.",pos
"This is the second top i have purchased in this design, the first being in the navy blue color. i loved the effortless swing of this shirt and the comfortable cotton texture, that i chose to purchase it in wine and have since received many compliments on both the shape and color. this is an easy top for me to put on and feel good within.",pos

"These pants were a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! the fun print and texture add interest, but at the same time, are not too busy. they seem well-made, and they have a slim and flattering fit. the side zipper is also a nice touch. i would definitely recommend this item.",pos
"Super cute dress - swingy, flattering, easy to wear. the pattern is great, and i felt like it was the perfect length for me - though i'm short, so it may be too short for someone taller. the dress runs big. i'm usually a 6, but i got this is a 4. only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk.",pos
"I bought this is in the gray color, although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said, and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it, giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather.",pos
"So happy with this top. i love the fabric, the colors and the flowy fit!  definitely recommend!",pos
"I want to love this shirt, i really do, but it's huge! the top is tent-like, which would be adorable with skinny jeans, however the length of the back dips so low, the top kind of reminds me of pajamas. the color is beautiful, more like a light grey heather, and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material. overall, the top is cute, but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt, so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front. sadly, it's a return.",neg

I absolutely love this sweater. it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights. a great staple!,pos
"The cut of this dress is what drew me to order it, but it is so much more! first, the fabric is more of a raw silk, which is more like a soft linen than silk.. it's also got a very soft lining that feels great on the skin, and it has pockets! love a dress with pockets! i also love that the design is on the front and back. i am 5' 4"", 133 lbs and a 36c, and ordered a size 6. it's a little big on the sides, so i probably should've returned it for a 4, but it wasn't big enough to make it annoying o",pos

it is a bit short, and i am petite, i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise, it may have been too short.

colors are nice, and i love the material, it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it",pos
"Just had to review this dress because it is so beautiful. the fabric is light and soft, and is really perfect for this flowy tiered design. the colors are really pretty, not too bright, and it fit perfectly. i would say that it is much more dressy than it appeared in photos. the bodice has some beading, and it was much longer on me than on the model, though still a perfect maxi length. it would be perfect to wear to a wedding or formal affair.",pos
"This dress makes me looks curvy,thin and sexy! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style. this one was a winner. i bought 2 others but this one was my favorite. i'm 5'5"" 130 (32dd) sz4 fit perfect. the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself. it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you'll love this dress!",pos

I've had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn & this vest is another fantastic purchase. the color/fit match the photos. the material is so soft. i've worn it quite a bit since i received it and it hasn't pilled. it's washed well too. the braided part can be folded down if you don't want it higher on your neck. it will still lay flat & drape nicely. it's perfect for cold weather. i'd love to see this come out in other colors too.,pos

"Gorgeous dress with a slimming pattern and flattering waistband. i would say the bust cups are a little floppy on the medium petite and i have 36dds. like others, i wish the skirt was lined but it's not a deal breaker. tracy reese did a great job creating movement in the skirt and flounce without the bulk. i can wear a little heel but wearing flats makes the hem drag.",pos

"Love these jeans. comfortable fit, doesn't stretch out too much after wearing a few hours. goes with dress up, lazy day or casual tops. my go-to jeans. wish they came in different washes",pos
"I have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair, and i get non-stop compliments on them. they are very flattering and drape beautifully. the fabric is also complete no-fuss and no-fade. this time, i went for the red pair, and i love them. they really go with the current upscale 70s vibe; they have the 70s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage 70s clothes.",pos
The embroidery across the top is quite lovely. the softness and light weighted fabric was ideal for the summer months. making this purchase on sale was such a bonus!,pos
"Perfect! very pretty and flattering without being too fussy. helps to hide my tummy and very well made. that said i have fairly wide shoulders and a larger ribcage so i had to size up considerably. usually a 4 or a 6 and i needed a 10 to be comfortable. the 8 went on but the fabric has no give so i sized up. i am never a 10 but that's what worked in this blouse. surprisingly it still looked nice and tailored. definately runs on the smaller side.

lovely. worth the full price in my opinion.",pos
"Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.",pos
"I recently purchased this dress at my local retailer when it was 40 percent on sale. i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. it's comfortable, elegant and very chic. 

i will make this my go-to dress from now on.",pos
"While this is cozy and well made, the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho, which looks unfinished. had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material, the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous. unfortunately, the faded backside of the pattern (a glimpse of it under model's left hand), viewable through the very large arm holes (and impossible to hide), disrupts the effortless, fluid feel that a poncho should have. i was",neg
"Regarding the product, high quality materials and overall make. extremely comfortable and flattering cut. i'd love this in all the colors of the rainbow.",pos
It's a beautiful top but not for bigger busts. ordered an xl and the top part would not button. i recommend for those with smaller busts.,neg
"Very cute jumpsuit, especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3, 115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!",pos
"I bought this skirt a month or so ago and only wore it for the first time yesterday. i thought the design was fluid, summer appropriate, and easy like sunday morning. i enjoyed wearing it so much that i went on to the retailer site today to order it in another color. and lo and behold i saw all the reviews on the sizing/fit. i totally respect other reviewers, so i questioned why that had not been my experience when i wore it yesterday, so much so that i went and put it on again, sans issues.i am n",pos
"I fell in love with this online and i'm so thrilled that it's even more beautiful in person. it is a stunning, very dark teal velvet with the most gorgeous embroidery. perfect fit, quality, and nicely lined. a keeper for years to come! i think it's true to size (for reference i'm 5'1, 100 lbs and the 0p fits perfectly)",pos
"Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail. its just what i was looking for, for my staple summer dress. i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top, and even can pair just the sweater top with my high-waisted shorts!",pos
"I love this dress. it's adorable and great for summer with a unique style- it's a bit unusual with the high and slightly ruffled neck. it can easily be dressed up or worn more casually. this is the most flattering dress i've found this season (particularly around the stomach area). i'm 5""3' and took a petite size, which fit perfectly. this dress is a bit translucent, so skin-toned undergarments are a must.",pos
"I wanted to love this, was so excited when i ordered it online. the fabric (blue and white) was beautiful, but the cut was bad. it fit me like a maternity top, and made me look like i was 6 months along. i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back, in the back, because it does not lay flat like that in front, it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out. returning.",neg
"Admittedly, i ignored this dress on a few trips to my local retailer and then it went on sale, practically begging me to give it attention. i tried it on and fell in love! so feminine, light, and comfortable. 
it has a sort of roman/boho goddess vibe due to the billowy top, especially in the lighter greige with some sea-hued accessories added but not so much it feels like cosplay or something. i have a full bust (dd) and didn't find this dress to be unflattering. after wearing it to a party, i ac",pos
"I love the elbow patches on this shirt. i ordered the wine color, and it's dark enough to almost be a neutral. i've worn it with many things already. my only complaint is that the sleeves are super long. typically, long sleeved shirts are too short for me, so i'm guessing this one would be ridiculously long on someone with short arms.",pos
"Love this shirt! looks great with a pair of black work slacks or with jeans. very flattering with the banded hem, and the material is soft.",pos
"Saw this online and thought it would be perfect for my upcoming plane ride. originally ordered the teal color, but when it arrived, i was disappointed that it was more of a muddy greenish teal and not the light bluish teal like in the photo. exchanged it for the black version and i couldn't be happier. the black goes well with everything--looks great with jeans and yoga pants. love it!!",pos
"I ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week, and this is by far my favorite purchase! the detail is gorgeous, it's very soft, and figure flattering.",pos
"I'm wearing lots of these long cardigans right now. this one is comfortable but holds up well. the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue. the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute, but doesn't get in the way. it's great for casual or casual work wear.",pos
"I am 5'9, very long waisted, generally a size 10-12 or med, but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up.

i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare - length and width
either way, this is a keeper!!

"I didn't think i'd like this due to the high neck, but i was in the store and it was so soft that i tried it on in the black motif. this dress is so comfortable and flattering. it's definitely a versatile piece: dress down with a denim jacket or dress up with heels. and it has pockets!",pos
"Based on the reviews of others, i ordered this dress a size larger than i usually wear and it fits perfect. i am an 8, so i got this in a 10. this is the perfect casual dress for pretty much anytime of the year -can be worn with sandals in the spring and summer, or boots in the winter.",pos
"I love vests and this is a great one, warm and cute!! because it is sweater material some of the threads look like than can pull, but i still think its stylish and different and still a classic to have!",pos
"The suit is lovely, but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg. i was told that it runs small and to size up to a 10. i did, but i do not think the smaller one would have done better. the bust is fake and it turns out when untied. worst of all it emphasizes the tummy. all in all not a good look for me. i am not heavy but i do need tummy support. normally i wear an 8 and in garnet hill a 6. sorry but it went back. i really wanted to like it.",neg
"Received these as a christmas gift from my daughter. just wonderful - warm and cozy and cute. size m is just a tad baggy; i'm sure i could have worn small, but no matter. i wear these often and love them! such a treat!",pos
"This tee is such a staple for me. i bought it in the green and it is such an elegant deep emerald. the perfect shade. the shirt has some detail that is not shown - there is stitching/seaming along the side in the front and back that give the shirt a good structure. the shirt also has a great weight to it. the knit is sort of a vertically ribbed knit but thicker than a classic ribbed tank top. the edges of the material are also open, almost-frayed edges. the additional detail on this shirt defini",pos
The fabric is great. the design is fun. i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out. the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected. so i had to return it.,neg
"I picked this top hoping that it would go with the dipped horizon skirt and the color was a perfect match! i love the irregularities in the dye, and the woven back. the cut is boxy, but the fabric is soft and drapes well so very flattering. looks great with white jeans",pos
"I'm very pleased with this jacket! i've never owned a ""vegan"" leather anything, so i didn't know if it would show up cheap looking or smelly.. but to my surprise, it didn't have a ""smell"" or that shiny cheap look. i'm so glad i headed the other reviewers advise and i sized up, my typical size would have been to tight and short! i'm excited to wear this with dresses and jeans this fall! i bought the ""honey"" color and it's more like a cross between beige and blush(a slight dusty pink hue)! i love",pos
"Super cute and comfy, perfect for fall and winter (apre ski!). great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots.",pos
I have never tried this brand before and was pleasantly surprised at the fit! i especially like the button detail as it makes them a little more dressy and different. i plan to wear with a simple white tank and sandals. i will definitely look for this brand again!,pos
This coat is wonderful! i am usually an xs-s in retailer and i got the xs. it is supposed to be a bit large. goes with everything and great quality.,pos
"This bra is very cute and pretty comfortable. i usually wear between a 34d in elle mcpherson and this fit perfect. i got it in black and while it's really cute i was surprised how different the color looked in person vs. online. online it looked to me to have some purple to it, but it is definitely 100% black in person (just an fyi). i also thought the tassel was cute, but it does look a little cheap and flimsy in person. still a great bra.",pos
"Love this sweater! warm, cozy and and not ordinary!!! fits great too! no surprises!",pos
"My favorite pants, casual and a bit dressier by changing my top. comfortable, classic, well made",pos
"This dress set my heart a-flutter, but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes, and when i put them on, they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).

so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v",pos
"I have been unable to find a jumpsuit that looks good, likely due to my long torso. this is the first one that doesn't make me look like i am a tall five-year-old (easy to dress it up with a statement necklace) and fits perfectly. i am 5'6"", 120 pds, and bought my normal xs. highly recommend, especially with the current extra % off promotion!",pos
"I love this dress, the print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique. i'm short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses don't work on me, this is an exception.

i ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me, which i think i like more than if it were a midi.

the armholes do cut in, i wasn't sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closer.

"These shorts are super soft and comfortable. i am normally a size 27 or a 2 in shorts. i got a size 26 in these shorts and they are still large. i exchanged them for a 25 and they fit perfectly. so these run 1-2 sizes large. other than sizing, these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional.",pos
"I really can't say enough about them. they have the perfect amount of stretch, are so comfortable and they keep their shape really well. i would say that you could wear them 3 times before washing. also, the color is perfect. they are tts and even allow for a little extra holiday weight without becoming a torture device.",pos
"In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely. i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l, which i did. the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape. it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me. the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial. all in all, a great purchase.",pos
"The colors (including the deep blue in the background) are as vibrant and harmonious in person as you would hope, it looks like an oil pastel drawing! the print itself is very well done, i'm so picky about the quality and resolution but even up close every part is beautiful. 

the cut is great, it doesn't show too much of the armpit, the straps and sides cover a normal bra, and the neckline just shows the collarbones.

the feel is very light and floaty; some sites mislabel the material but t",pos

"I really loved this skirt on the model, but it just wasn't flattering when i received my order. i ordered two sizes - 2 and 4. i am 5'4, athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is. the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to. 

sadly, i had to return both. perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame.",neg

I wasn't sure about this top but i had a feeling i needed to at least try it on. it drapes so beautifully and the keyhole neck is a lovely little touch. i love the asymmetric hemline and the fabric is incredibly soft. as far as the fit goes i found that it did run slightly small.,pos
"The fabric of this top is lovely. the fit not so. it does not fit as shown on the model. the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a ""swing"" top. i am 5'9"" slim build. i ordered my usual size medium. shoulders and back fit perfectly. too much material around the middle. had it had a straight cut to it, as shown, i'd keep it. because it doesn't it's going back.",neg
"Very soft and comfortable, great for girls who don't usually like shorts because of bigger/muscular thighs. i would say these run large, but not drastically. for reference, i'm usually a size 6 on the bottom and i got a small. the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house.",pos
"This top is gorgeous and better than the web photo. i love that it goes with the off-the-shoulder trend while allowing for a normal bra - in fact, it even has the little snaps at the shoulders to hold your straps in place (awesome detail). the ruffled portion looks good over or under your arms, length hit at about my hip (5'7"" with long torso; 125lbs, 32b) and, and it has an overall flowy but not sacklike fit. i found this to fit tts (bought my usual s). beautiful vivid print looks great with wh",pos

the color of this paid is a subtle green. looks great with black skirt and green sweater.",pos
"I have been on the fence about this blouse until i went into the store and tried it on. instant love for me.
the fabric is not sheer.....yeah! the shoulders are cut in, so you may need a halter bra. i typically go between a 4 or 6, but found the cut at a a line so there is a nice flow, but not overly so, so purchased the 4. the colors will go with anything, for many seasons. love the quality.",pos
"These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect, quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately.",pos
It is the perfect shirt that looks and feels great. i wear a size 4 and it fits perfectly.,pos

"This jacket has been a fun addition to my wardrobe. it has a very cute fit, and i like that it pulls in a bit at the sides to give it a form fitted look. best of all it stretches well despite the form fit; you can cross your arms or raise them up and you don't feel like your movement is restricted. i really like the soft suede-like material on the inside of the arms and the sides of the jacket. it fits true to size. can be worn casual or dressed up a bit. highly recommend!",pos

"Love this dress so much! i bought the cranberry color first, and i loved it so much, that i also bought it in black. i think it runs fairly true to size. i am 5'3"" and about 110, and the xs petite fit perfectly. i tried the xs, and it was pretty large on my frame. i love the fabric and flow of this dress, and i love the pockets.",pos
"I bought the grey version of this shirt in-store because of the cute pattern, soft material, and versatility of wear; you can dress it up for work or wear with jeans/shorts for a more casual look. the beautiful purples, greens, and blues of the roses look like a water color painting, and stand out against the grey background. i've already received multiple complements from co-workers and friends, and liked it so much myself i bought the other two colors! personally i think it runs a bit large, s",pos
"When i saw this top online i loved it, and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops, and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer, but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is, if you a little busty, the neckline might dip a tiny bit",pos
"I bought this top in the store and love it. i was surprised to see negative reviews online. i am small chested, curvier on the bottom. this top does have a wide and short fit but the cut is flattering. all three colors are beautiful. i wear it with high waist short jean shorts and it looks very fresh.",pos
"This is m frist pair of flares, and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed, but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly, but combined with the flare, the high waist is",pos
"Nice tee, true red,3/4 sleeves, lacing is a nice touch. good quality and great sale price.",pos
This top is so pretty in person. it bells out at the bottom just the right amount.,pos
"The fabric is very soft, love the purple floral color. the top is very flattering with the ease and comfort of a t-shirt.",pos
"First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store.",neg
"Saw this in the store, looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale. got it this weekend with the 20% off and love it! (thanks retailer) wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments. as someone else noted, it does catch on itself so take care when wearing. also, the slits on the side are semi-high but as my husband noted, this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic. i went with an 8 for this reason(you could also wear a tank underneath). and yes, even on sale,",pos
"I love this skirt! i wasn't sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works! it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too! the quality is great - the skirt is a fine silk, ant it is lined, so you don't need a slip. i think it fits perfectly for my body type, and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing, it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway. i am normally a 0 petite, 5'2"", 104, waist 24.5"", hips 34",pos
"I bought this top in the store, which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do. i loved the flowy fit of it. the washing instructions say machine wash cold, tumble dry low. i washed it on cold and hung it to dry. it shrank to the point of being unwearable (the dreaded button gap!) and lost its softness. i hope the store lets me return it.",neg
"The dress is very beautiful and looks expensive. it will make a nice wedding dress. it does run quite small though. i am 5'2"" and 90-95lbs with a straight figure, but the 00p was too constricting.",pos
"This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some, the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores, but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.",pos
These are fabulous leggings for cold days. i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm! love them and i highly recommend. only con is that they are about 1/2 of an inch shorter than i would like.,pos
"This dress is very well made and the fabric hangs beautifully. i weigh 125 and usually wear a small but sized up to medium for a longer sleeve and hem. the print, fabric and style make it appropriate for daytime or evening. it should transition nicely to fall and will look great with boots.",pos
"The girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh, & i've been thinking maybe i shld try them out. i ordered these online in the size 29, as i am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. i am a little hard to please, or say hard to fit in skinny jeans. i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if it's uncomfortable. paying full price it is expected for the look & fit to be perfect. even if on sale, i won't go it if i think something is not right for me. at 5'3"", 117#, slender legs, skinnys are either",pos
"Wow, this dress is so incredibly designed and made! the style is a subtle showstopper - classic and beautiful like they don't make anymore.
the inside of the dress is so well constructed, it has its own beauty!

i read that it ran a little large, so i tried the 0 and the 00, since i usually wear a 0. well the 00 looked like a lingerie commercial with the dress unable to zip above the waist!! the 0 fit and zipped, but i could not sit down comfortably. yikes!
the 2 was a winner. i'm 5'4 1/2"", 110",pos
"Very disappointed: runs small in chest and too long. the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail. i don't think  this dress is worth the price, it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze. i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion. put it back on the rack, and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer!",neg
"Very nice quality!! awesome style, the fabrics is so soft but very durable!! this top will be great with jeans or a denim skirt!!",pos
"So pretty, love hte design on this one.
i tried on hte regualr size, adn will not need a petite, it hit me jsut above my knee. younger gals may oprefer shorter, however.

the aottern is also nice. the cut is flowy and flattering, nothing bad to say about htis dress...",pos
"Totally love this shirt as a basic with fun details. super soft great quality fabric, and the cutouts add the perfect bit of interest. can see this accessorizing well and looking good with jeans or skirts. really happy with it. fits loose, but tts.",pos
These legging are adorable. i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome. the buttons at the ankle are cute. i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i don't like to spend so much on leggings.,pos
This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year. it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft. i wouldn't describe it as chunky or bulky though. it's probably made of at least 2 or maybe even 3 ply cashmere. the sleeves do run slightly short. i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly! grab it while you can! it's so luxurious & super warm for the winter.,pos
This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.,neg
"Love this un-basic white top. it's very flattering on, and i love that it's a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i am usually a size 8 in maeve tops/dresses, but i found a size 6 fit me a bit better in this particular top. if your'e in between sizes, you may need to size down. i definitely recommend this top!",pos
I had been waiting for this dress to go on sale and when it did it was only available in a petite xs. the only reason i said it ran big is because it was a petite and i usually wear a regular. i am 5'4 size 2. the length is perfect and i have really narrow shoulders so the petite fit perfect. the details on this dress are just beautiful and extremely comfortable.,pos
"I too was immediately drawn to this dress online and was this close to ordering a petite when i stopped my my local retailer and they had just gotten it in, in regular only. of course i tried it on (in the xs regular) and was thrilled to find it fit perfectly and was so flattering on my hourglass figure. i'm 5'1"" and 115 with a 32 dd chest. no gaping or pulling, the waist and shoulders were where they should be and i found the length, with the hi/lo hem to be just above my knees in front. i think",pos
"The tunic is very pretty! when i visited antho store, i was just fallen in love with it. 
i purchased purple one because the color is for fall. this is good for straight and slender body type.
please purchase it before it is gone!",pos
"I purchased this dress for a baby shower and it was just perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 pounds and ordered the petite xs which fit great. the dress is supposed to be a tad oversized and flowy so this size worked out great for me! it will also be a nice transition piece into spring with a pair of black fringe booties :) overall, i recommend this dress!!",pos
"I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress, twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it's mainly the irresistible print, i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s, with tights and boots, but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders, so don't size down. i do wish the fabric was not",pos
"These jeans run true to size, very comfy and i love the frayed bottoms",pos
"So soft. a casual tunic, yet polished and interesting enough for work. darker blue than the photo, and the colors are much brighter and prettier in person.",pos
"Perfection! i am 5'3""/108 and the size 25 fit me like a glove. beautiful color too!! highly recommend!!",pos
I love everything bordeaux so when i saw this one i knew i needed to try it and it's my favorite top from this brand ever. i hope they keep the style and offer it in all of the colors going forward. it's a very flattering style for anyone - accentuates shape without being tight or clingy and the stripes are lovely. also the material is so soft. i have not washed it yet so i hope it stands up to wash and wear well. overall this is an amazing top. it runs slightly large. i'm usually an xs in tops,pos
I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!,neg
"My favorite pair of ags. i normally wear sz26 but i have awkward proportions when it comes to finding jeans that are actually ""ankle"" length on me. i orders these in a petite and went a size up to be safe. it doesn't seem like they've stretch out any and they fit exactly how i want. i love the dark wash bc they can be both dressed up and down.",pos
"Love this shirt. it's perfect. it's so perfect that i bought two. it is boxy but it has a lovely drape. please note, the heart is navy blue and not so black as shown. it's a thin shirt and i know it won't last a super long time, hence the back up.",pos
"Love this top. it's very comfortable,  and flatters  my midsection. versatile piece.",pos
This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down. the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long (but that was an easy fix).,pos
I just received this in the mail today and i love it! its adorable- very flattering and hides all the spots you'd want hidden. i don't find that this runs too large. i ordered my usual size large and it fits tts. it's not meant to fit snug. i ordered this in the navy color- beautiful and flattering!,pos
"I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed. first, the pink was way to sheer for my liking. the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area. then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect. a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit. the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks.",neg
"Was hesitant to order it as first since i was worried it might be a little too boxy in person. glad i tried it since that turned out not to be the case. drapes nicely (exactly like in the picture) and can be worn either on its own or layered with a cardigan/shrug. loose fit means i can wear it to work, too. am usually between a small and xs but the xs fit me well. also wanted to mention this hits me right under the waist and i'm 5ft4 so there is a chance it could be a little too short for someon",pos
"I ordered a m/l in this vest and it fits perfectly. thirst is cozy and stylish. in fact, i ordered the same vest in another color! it's versatile enough to wear with both skirts and jeans. i also think it's a timeless piece that will stay in style for years to come.",pos
"I love wearing my boatneck pullover. the unique part of this item is the back with buttons. the shirts appears to be inside out, however, its not. its soft, comfortable, stylish and warm. i really like how it's longer in the back.",pos
"I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected (i'm 5'2"", 112lbs). the material wears like a tee, so it's comfortable, but the front details give it a special look. this is going to be on my go-to list all summer.",pos
"The dress is just ok. i cannot imagine having paid full price for this. i got it for florida vacation. i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained!!!! cant get it out. thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like. 
sending back",neg
"I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.",neg
This dress is super cute and sexy. i bought the taupe in a size medium. for reference i'm tall (5'11) and weigh about 152. i don't know how tall the last reviewer is but this was not too short in the front for me. i really like it.,pos
"A perfectly fun pant for a gray or sunny, winter day. i like the longer length, to the ankle on me, pairing with my kate spade black sabina combat boots and a eileen fisher black cashmere, boxy, cropped sweater. another fun option is to pull out the pink accent in the pant with a pink camisole under a black sweater. the fabric weight is good for winter, they do feel a little itchy at first but it's not noticeable after wearing them a short while.",pos
This is a great dress that can be dressed up or worn with flip flops. i also love that it has pockets :),pos
"These are my favorite pair of capris/ankle jeans ever! i'm 5'4"", 120lbs and got the 28 petite in gray. the fit is fantastic and the length is perfect for summer days (couple inches above my ankles). the gray color is so versatile and i can dress it up or down. i plan on getting it in other colors as well since the fit is so good.",pos
I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!,pos
"I love this dress. so simple yet beautiful. very excited to wear this spring and summer, perfect for easter.",pos
"I ordered the medium, my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely, looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back.",pos
"I love quirky and unique sweaters/ cardigans, and this is no exception. it's not obvious in the photo (at least it wasn't for me), but the cardigan does have buttons all the way down, and not just at the top, something i appreciated. those buttons, however, are not easy to un-button. the snails are adorable without being childish. i'm 5'4 130lbs, often between a small and medium when it comes to cardigans. i chose the medium for this one, which fit exactly how i wanted it to (a.k.a. sleeves were",pos
"Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try. love. it's the perfect, cozy cute sweater, color is beautiful and fit is great. i am 5 5"" 135 lbs and i tried both the small and extra small. i went with the xs for a more flattering fit. i love it.",pos
"I found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing.  it's lined and tts.  i usually wear a size 4 and this fit well.  some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good 2 inches in length.  i'm 5'3"" and 119# and it hit me just above the knee.  i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi & kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt.  it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have",pos
"This dress is amazing ! the colors in person are so vibrant and yet organic somehow at the same time. perhaps this is because the fabric has a really nice depth and texture to it. i got this dress for a summer wedding and it's casual yet dressy at the same time. 

re: fit - the best thing about this dress - is a fit ! it's so incredibly flattering on, it fits like a glove. it just hugs your figure in the most flattering way, especially if you have an hourglass figure. the fit is true to size -",pos
"I first saw this shirt online and decided to see it in person. so happy i did! i never would have picked it up in the store. it looks much better on than on the hanger. it is so flattering! you can wear it on or off the shoulders and although it is a boxy shirt, it somehow makes you look slim! wow! i took my usual medium. highly recommend!",pos
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.,pos
"I bought this dress to wear for our upcoming family pictures. i don&#39;t think the image does the dress justice - the fit is so flattering and slimming. i feel like it can easily be dressed down too, with a cute jacket in either denim or leather. the material is thinner, and it does wrinkle a bit. the price tag is a tad high also for a thin maxi dress, but i just had to have it. :)",pos
"Love this top, the contrasting lace/eyelet is pretty and interesting. it flairs in a flattering way.",pos
"I have to disagree with some previous reviews -- i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart. they look absolutely adorable with booties, flats, wedges, heels, anything! and they're extremely comfortable and flattering, as most pilcros tend to be. i got my usual size 26 and the rise and fit is great. i think maybe they stretch out a bit; i've only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose. but overall, great and a good price (at least co",pos
"This one is perfect for the taller ladies (or those looking for a longer fit). i was a little discouraged by a few short-fitting tops recently, and this one finally works for me (at 5'7"" with a long torso). awesome quality, not overly delicate, and beautiful detail.",pos
"I fell in love with dress immediately! it runs small, but is very flattering, even if you have a little you want to hide. i went up 1 size. so comfy and beautiful! love!!",pos
"I have always had a thing for velvet, and velvet pants are hard to come by so i was so pleased to see these and i rushed to order a pair in the dark turquoise. they are beautiful; exactly as pictured, but a bit longer in length on me. i am 5'3"". they can be dressed up, but what is so fun about them is that they can easily be dressed down as well. i am wearing them with a heather-grey t-shirt. they also pair well with the metallic linen tees. my one and only criticism is that they are a bit wide",pos
"Not being into bright neon colors, i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it's super cute and very flattering.",pos
"This vest is adorable! i love the color, it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great, some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly, i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall, but it works perfectly with my build.",pos
I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.,pos
Just lovely!  gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!,pos
"Very pleased with the fabric and design of this. it is thick, but not heavy, and the cutouts in front fall so that you don't really have to wear anything underneath (there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i didn't initially notice, but wasn't really a problem). i'm 5""4/b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest. i couldn't wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up. it's also a bit shorter than i th",pos
"This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans, white jeans, shorts, dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!",pos
I just received this dress and tried it on. it's a nice dress that is flattering but the material was much heavier that i expected it to be. it's way to heavy to wear in the florida heat so unfortunately it's going back.,pos
I am very surprised by the low reviews of this dress. this dress is obviously a very loose fitting style. it is a bit of a man repellar dress.the quality of the fabric is beautiful and the pattern stunning. i find the loose flowy style liberating and comfortable. i love it with otk boots and tights for winter but also planning to wear with sandals in spring. i am 125lbs and purchased the petite small.,pos
I bought this in navy - it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on. super flattering and i don't even need to wear a bra with it,pos

"This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact.",pos
"Purchased this fun, feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day. the peplum style isn't typically something i gravitate to, but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer 3/4 length sleeves. i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans, oxfords & a cute hat. for how beautiful this top is, i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal!",pos
"I'm always thrilled to find a piece like this at retailer - just received my dress and couldn't be happier! beautifully made and fits absolutely perfectly. i'm 5'5"" 118 lbs. and am very comfortable in the small (with a little breathing room). length is perfect with heels. planning to wear it with sandals to a birthday party this month and then into fall and winter with boots and a top layer. if you're hesitating, go for it!",pos
"This item is pretty, the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery, but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents. my issue with it is it's very impractical. the fabric is extremely thin, and you wouldn't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees. it's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season. the tube top underneath doesn't work very hard to stay up, and isn't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit (why wouldnt they just stitch a lining",neg
"Beautiful color and flattering fit on me. i bought the size 4 and it fits my 5'5"" 125 lb frame perfectly. i love that it has sleeves!! no worries about upper arms. it is light and silky even though it is not made of silk. it is elegant and casual at the same time thus versatile. i will wear it to three different weddings this summer and can make it work for the office too. love it. worth every penny..",pos

I got the off-white lace top and love it! quality is great for the price. comfortable and the lace isn't super delicate so it seems like it should last.,pos
Love this top!! fits perfectly & it's lovely,pos
"Love these pants! super comfy and casual. i found they run true to size and are just lose enough to feel casual, not sloppy. my only complaint, the cuffs of the jeans were thoroughly covered in some kind of animal hair! very disgusting. but love the jeans.",pos
"I bought this in my usual size small, and love it. looks great with skinnies or pencil skirts. not sheer enough to need a cami, but enough to look cottony and breezy. very elegant. it falls flatteringly on my shape - 34c, 28-38, 5'3"". it has an elegant, arty vibe. if you have a long torso or big chest, i would say try it on in the store to make sure the chest area falls well for you.",pos
"I was surprised at how much i liked this sweater. i was watching it for awhile and when it went on sale i decided to give it a try. i couldn't decided on the rose or black so i ordered both since they were such a good price, figuring i would return the color i didn't want. boy was i happy i ordered both. the rose is very flattering and the fit is so much better than i expected. i am 5'9' and usually take a large in size. i could have gone down one size, but the front drapes against your body it",pos
This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.,pos
"I don't normally write reviews, but i purchased this dress in white in 3 different sizes and each dress had the same flaw. the hems were very uneven on all three. this dress was poorly sewn. it's a shame because it looked awesome online. i was very disappointed!!!!!",neg
"I purchased all the colors of this wonderful tee after receiving the first. it's machine wash and dry, and they've all held up well through multiple washes so far. the neckline and fit is flattering for a larger bust, due to the ribbing, but would be great on a more athletic figure as well. the fabric is soft enough that the 3/4 sleeves don't bug me, like some other tops do. all the colors are great and you'll want more than one! true to size.",pos
"Everything about this dress is exceptional. the fit, material, workmanship, and style are wonderful. the dress even has 2 petticoats to make the skirt stand out. the dress is modern in style, yet classic.",pos
"I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work, but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long. i am 5 foot 10 and do not have short arms. also it is a bit short waisted for me. i do love the floral detail of the button.",neg
"I wore this dress yesterday and was complemented wherever i went and asked where i purchased the dress. i love the linen and the back of the dress is so flattering. i ordered a medium and could have gone with a small, which i usually never wear, so i would order a size smaller.",pos
Love this sweater! i almost passed it up on-line because i didn't notice the snails. the sweater is navy and the snails are black. they are so cute and such a fun and unique little accent. the material is a moderate to light-weight sweater. the length was perfect. i have inadvertently purchased a bunch of cropped sweaters this year - this one is not cropped - yay!! the sleeves are actually a bit on the long side. i sized up a little with the idea of wearing it over long sleeved tops. i am typica,pos

"I am a jumpsuit convert. i tried it on ""just in case,"" but was amazed at how easy and effortlessly adorable it is. i purchased the black, petite 4, and love that it is super versatile in terms of seasonality and styling options. i have an hourglass figure and the draping and fit of the piece work very well.",pos
"I loved this top when i first saw it online and it did not disappoint when i received it in the mail. it's very lightweight, perfect for spring, cool summer night, early fall. i really like the design and like that you can tuck it in. there is enough fabric in the front to give it a ""flowy"" look that i appreciate bc i will be giving birth soon and my post baby body will likely need some coverage! great top!",pos
"Love this sweater for so many reasons; fits true to size, unique in design, versatile, soft and so easy to wear. i've worn it tied in the back and front. it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work, date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans. i love haying clothes i can get the most out of. highly recommend this sweater!",pos

"I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that. it's flattering, light weight and unique. i've received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress. i am 5' 6"" 150 lbs, hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium (8-10) and chose a small for this dress. i'd say it's still loose on me- which is what i prefer. the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra. however, i've noticed i'm more comfortable wearing a camisole or s",pos
"This sweater is beautiful! it fits/drapes nicely, is a gorgeous color, feels soft, and is comfortable to wear. i'm generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium. the sleeves are pretty long--i have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand, but that's all right--they look fine rolled. i highly recommend!",pos
"I kept stalking this cape on the site since it went on a few months ago and finally decided to pull the trigger. this is an absolutely gorgeous cape.perfect for hourglass figures because of the waist-defining belt. its a really modern cut - it reminds me of some of the red carpet cape dresses of late. its so elegant - this is a timeless cut. the nude is a gorgeous, rich warm brown color. if you're really busty, you might go up a size to get the girls covered. i ordered my usual size m, and i may",pos
Colors are very vibrant! lays very nicely on the body.,pos
"This top is so comfortable and better quality than i expected. ruffles fall nicely over your sholulder and there is a fabric underarm, i don't have to wear a tank top underneath like i normally would with tops with wide opening around arms. color is beautiful too, i really love it. true to size.",pos
This dress is even better in person! the attention to detail and craftsmanship are amazing. i received compliments all night from total strangers.,pos
"I love this dress! the fabric feels amazing & is super flattering. i am 5'4 with broad shoulders & a 36d chest and went with the small petite. i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great, i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders & length. it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest",pos
"This dress is gorgeous. it looks exactly as it appears on model. the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone 5'8. the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else. i am not petite, but this petite worked perfect on me for midi length.
pros of dress
the dress has nice light float fabric, with colorblind on bottom for a touch of modern.
the dress looks very dowton abby and the vintage look is hard to find now days in dress.
the dress looks fa",pos
"The perfect jeans for daytime and bending down with the kids or dressing up later for night. i love that the cuff isn't sewn, so you can choose to roll them down too. with just the right amount of stretch, they are extremely flattering. they are definitely my new favorite pair this season!",pos
"This dress looks simple, but man is it unexpectedly sexy. and oh so comfortable! the deep v neckline and side slits elevate this from a simple tshirt dress to something else. add just the right accessories and this dress transforms. i have the xs and its just roomy enough without being clingy. and did i say how comfortable it is? the fabric is perfectly lightweight without being flimsy and color is a cool, saturated denim color. i receive compliments every time i wear it. love love love.",pos
Love this romantic girlie girl dress. so pretty.,pos
"This shirt is boxy. but, as the pictures clearly shows, that is the design of it. if you know how to style outfits, it's a great buy. i really like it. i'm tall and slender, so it's a bit easier for me to pull this off. the design and color are just really neat. really cool shirt for the fall.",pos
"Lovely summer top, comfortable and cool for hot summer days. beautiful fabric, fits tts. highly recommend.",pos
"These were as great in person as i had hoped; great color for fall, super comfy and flattering fit. happy with my purchase!",pos
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale 25% off. the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not. it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since it's baby doll shape, but it didn't work for me around the arm holes (and mine are not that big). i am 5'3"" and 120 lb and size 2 worked perfect.",pos
Saw this in store and could hardly wait to try it on! the print is adorable and colors are vibrant. the material is heavier than i'd like for hot phoenix summers but decided to get it anyway. will be great for work. i noticed that there is a little more room in the chest area of this dress but not a deal breaker. seems to be well made in general and i love the pockets!,pos
"This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw.",pos
"This wasn't for me. i have a short neck and am 5.3"". the length was fine on the one i tried on, but other proportions were off. it was too big around, in the middle, yet tighter at the bottom. on me, this made it resemble a large bag. the neckline stood up on mine. even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model, it still felt like a whiplash collar (coming up over my chin). i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft.",neg

"This top is absolutely beautiful. i especially love the richness of the black and burgundy one! i am typically a size medium but purchased the large because i wanted it to fit a little bigger and longer - i was going for more of a tunic-style. if you're broad-shouldered like i am, you may opt for a bigger size as well because the sleeves can look a little silly if its too small.",pos

"I'm 6 ft tall and usually wear a size 10/12, but had to size up to a 14 because this dress runs a bit small around the waist. it's a beautiful dress. it hit me right below the knee, so might be long on shorter gals. i received many compliments on this dress. the colors are beautiful. the main color of the dress is a dark navy. it looked black online. definitely buy this dress! it's a great work dress and you won't be sorry that you did.",pos

it is an absolute must-have!",pos
"Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive, and then once they do, i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it. this is one of those times, and it was not my mistake. the shirt i received is not like this one. it is an xs, but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model. everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color, not grey at all. it is a pretty color, but not what i thought i was ordering. i hate it when this happens",neg
"I tried this on in the burgundy color in the store, and hoping it goes on sale soon! the fabric is not too thin like some of their tops. i run the gamut in retailer sizes , but lean towards mediums. this top fit beautifully in a small! it drapes nicely and doesn't hug the body, nor is it too flowy, looking maternity-ish. i am 5'4"" 140 and 34dd for reference . it looks like it will hold up well and the bit of lace makes it dressy casual. if it doesn't go on sale soon i might have to get it anyway b",pos
"These are amazing. so comfortable, true to size (i usually wear a 29 in pilcro and ag and bought these in a 29). i have curvy thighs and a smaller waist but didn't get a gap situation with these. the only issue i have is the length. i'm 5'6"" and wish they were a tiny bit shorter. they hit right at the top of my foot so i keep debating if i should cuff them or not, since the length looks more flattering cuffed but then the actual cuff looks a little weird. i bought them in black for work, and now",pos
"I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me, but it lays perfectly. very comfortable, well-designed, flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops, but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!",pos
Super cute plaid top. i love the colors they are vibrant and go well with my fair complexion. it is a short top and would pair well with high waisted jeans or skirts.,pos
"I just got this skirt in the mail, and i'm absolutely delighted with it. i'd ordered both my normal size and one size up, taking a tip from the reviewer who'd found it snug, but my usual retailer size fit beautifully.

"This dress is incredible! let me say that when it first arrived, i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandma's curtain. the print was really overwhelming for my living room. however, i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods. not only was in incredibly flattering, it photographed better than i could have imagined. wouldn't recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion!",pos
"These pants are much cuter on than in the picture. i love the fit, snug legs and normal waist. will order again in another color.",pos
Great fitting longer tee. comfortable and light. longer short sleeve a nice change from cap sleeves.,pos
"I really wanted this dress to be perfect, but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering. the other reviewer is about 8 inches taller than me, perhaps it works better on a taller frame.",neg
"I love sanctuary clothing. this parka is on the lighter side, good for this mild east coast winter. it is water repellent. the length hits me on my upper thigh and the sleeves are long ( good for longer limbs). i received many compliments.",pos
I love this top. it's very comfortable looks great and the quality is very good. i've had many compliments on it.,pos
"Love this dress! can be dressed down or up for dresser occasions. i did order a petite which i usually don't do but due to the length being so long but the petite is just right hitting a couple inches below the knee. i'm 5'4""",pos
"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin, it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78, it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?), but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b), so it did nothing for me..

also, the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green",neg

i often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top. i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me. i also don't love long flowy tops with jeans all the time. the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle section.

This is a comfortable pretty blouse. i purchased the neutral print and am very pleased with it.,pos

Ordered this in my normal size large in taupe. the jacket fit tts. the length was cropped but just long enough (hit just below my belly button) to feel comfortable and not too short for my 5'9 height. the quality feels good.,pos
"This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit. jumpsuits are always tricky for me, but this one fits like a dream. i would say it runs true to size, with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest. you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls, but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part. that's not typically a problem for me being a 32d. i don't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais",pos
"Adorable foxes, i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes don't come up very high so you're limited in the length you can wear. i bought the m/l based on salesperson advice and i can't imagine trying anything smaller, i usually wear a size s or 4 bottom, these were super snug. back to the store they went.",neg
"I just love the bright yellow floral pattern and the off the shoulder sleeves. the loose fit is really ideal for when i just want to throw something on and run out the door but look super cute at the same time. it runs a little large to give you the flowy look, but i like things flowy so this wasn't an issue for me but a plus!",pos

I love this dress. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i was able to wear it to work and look nice but stylish. it was nice that it isn't too heavy but the turtleneck kept me warm enough.,pos

"Don't get me wrong, this is probably cute on someone else, but not me. i looked in the mirror and just laughed, it was that bad. so if you're considering getting this, size down. ordered mine in large and it looks like i'm wearing a barrel. the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape. the fabric is soft. i'm just over trying peplums.",neg
I wanted to love this shirt. the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out. the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through.. sadly i will be returning.,neg
I love this skirt so much. it's so comfortable and flattering. the button design along the sides is adorable. it's got a liner inside the skirt that ensures that it's not see-through in anyway. it's a great buy.,pos
"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!",pos
"This dress is super cute, flattering and well made but it runs very small. i am usually a 6 so from other reviews i ordered an 8 and it is still tight in the hip area. it zips but the fabric pulls a bit in the front and it rides up when i walk. i am going to try and exchange it for a 10 because i think i'll get lots of wear out of it.",pos

This dress is super comfortable and well made. i am 5'10 150lbs and the large was a little too big but with a belt it worked out just fine,pos
I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!,pos
"I love this t-shirt, i feel classy, stylish and comfortable wearing it. as other reviewers have noted, it is bellowy in the peplum, but that is the design and i love it. it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual. another terrific purchase from retailer!",pos
"I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve. i am very disappointed, because i love the sweater. by the time it arrived, it was sold out in my size. now, i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged. if the sweater was not damaged, i would recommend this product.",neg

I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!,pos
I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!,pos

Loved this top! it's an a-line shape which is very flattering. thick enough for winter with a coat but light enough for spring still.,pos
"I love the greenish option, beautiful color. the fabric super soft, and like the peek thru openings on the arms - they call it lace, but it's not really. i'm 5'9 and 140 lbs, medium was good. it is long, but it is what i wanted so works for me.",pos
"I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store, but, they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but, it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute, love it!",pos
This top has glam written all over it. the pleating gives it a delicate look but is not cheaply made or feeling. it lays so beautiful...i would say this runs tts but because i am busty i sized up to give it more of flowy look. because i am busty it also looks like high low blouse. no need for a necklace the flowers and shimmer do all the work for you. i paired it with leather leggins and it was adorable.,pos
Hands-down one of the more comfortable shirts i've purchased from retailer.,pos
Perfect for a hot day and skins the body beautifully. so soft! i am usually a medium but got a small which fit perfect. usually swing dresses do not compliment the waistline but this one did!,pos
I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the,pos

Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me,pos

I love this dress! the design and colors used are beautifully done. it looks stunning on. can be worn for work or dressed up.,pos
Saw this in store and knew i gotta have it! beautiful colors and slimming effect.,pos

Really cute suit but way too small up top. not enough coverage under arms and across bust.i wish retailerpolgie carried bathing suits in the stores so they can be tried on. this is the 2nd suit i have ordered that had to be returned. i wont order a bathing suit again as its just to much of a risk.,neg
My new favorite piece of loungewear. super cute and comfortable.,pos
"I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has! i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online. the fabric is interesting-it looks almost plastic in the online pictures but don't be fooled, it is still a comfortable fabric. it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it. there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into, but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th",pos

"The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.",neg

These are just as cute as pictured. they are generously sized made from soft denim. the denim has quite a bit of stretch. i ordered a size down from my normal size. i was surprised by all the extra threads in the pockets. they were still attached to the inside of the pockets. it just made them feel a little unfinished. these didn't impact the overall wear or appearance of the garment. the straps are adjustable with two buttons on the overalls and three strap-length adjustments on the straps. the,pos

i love the earthy color combined with feminine lace... unique, comfy, gorgeous!",pos
"I'm curvy, have very muscular thighs and am just under 5'5"". i was not very optimistic when the sales associate told me i would love these jeans. she was right, they're amazing. they are incredibly flattering, just the right length for me (even tho cropped) as i can wear them as full-length or just add one or two rolls and it's a crop. the fabric is amazingly soft and they immediately felt like a favorite, old pair of jeans. the pockets are well placed so they do wonders for the bootie. oh, and",pos
"I ordered these jeans twice because i love them. the first pair were mis-marked by about 4 sizes so i re-ordered. second pair still didn't fit, they run really small, i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet:(",neg
I loved this t-shirt. i got the grey one in small. i'm a size 2 and 5'3. it is a relaxed fit. i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair. i didn't want t plan t shirt but i also didn't want anything too crazy. fits well and is soft too.,pos
This green sweater is solo pretty . i wanted it from the moment i saw it. pretty layers on the bottom make it so unique!,pos
"This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!",pos
"I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this.",pos

"This is a great top, not cheap but funky! it would look nice on any figure. the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows. great value for a pretty party top - but it can go anywhere!",pos
I fell in love with this poncho at first sight. the colors are neutral so it can be worn with a lot. i'm a typical m and it does run large so i went with a s and it's perfect. long enough to cover leggings and great for the in between seasons. i've worn it at least five times since purchase and get compliments every time.,pos
"I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank, but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!",pos
"This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!",pos
"I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!",pos

"I love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby. it works for multiple occasions/events, and is so comfortable. if daytime pajamas sounds good to you, this is your jumpsuit. dress it up with an up-do and dangly earrings, or down with slip-ons and a cardigan, i have found that i can't go wrong with it. fits me just perfectly, doesn't wrinkle too much during wear, and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient.",pos
"Based on other customer reviews, i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer. however, the fabric is much heavier than what i'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are.

they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy, so if you are an xs these will be xs (or runs small for retailer clothing) if you like your clo",neg
I had hoped this blouse would be white - but it is cream in color. it was also more boxy than i thought it would be. i am usually a 4 or a 6 and went with the 6. a size 4 would be a better fit.,neg
It's really crazy how much i like this sweater. i am surprised by the weight of the sweater. it is a medium-light weight that will be appropriate year round. it fits perfectly and is very flattering open or zipped. i will wear this as a stand alone top with a tank underneath for now and in place of a spring jacket when the weather is warmer. this is a nice find.,pos
"Love these shorts. they do run large, i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green, and not as bright as what i see in the online photo, but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but i'm sure that will wash out.",pos

it is even more beautiful in person.
stunning hemline and a gorgeous shade of teal!
i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection.....very very true to size.",pos
"I bought the color ""black motif""although the markings look more dark purple and are similar to tie dyed coloring which is one of the things i love about this top. the fabric is so soft and i love the way the neckline falls. it is slightly sheer so may want to wear camisole underneath. personally i'm fine without it. looks great with jeans. i also tried it on in the ""blue motif"" which is the stripe version but found nothing special about that one.",pos
This dress fits perfectly and true to size. the waist detail and flair is fun and flirty. it's probably my favorite dress i've ever bought.,pos
"This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress. really love it. however, there's no way that model is 5' 10"" in the photo because i'm 4 inches shorter than that, and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me. it's really not a dress, it's a tunic. i'm happy with it because it's so pretty, but i did think i was buying a dress. i just wore it with leggings and i'm happy with a beautiful tunic!",pos

"This arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on. this is the epitome of the effortless tank. its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace. unfortunately it didn't quite work for me. if you have any kind of tummy or chest, size up. i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me. however, my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on",pos
"This one didn't work for me. there is no zipper, you climb into it from the very large neck hole. it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug. the tie and waist seam didn't hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle. i tried other belts and it wasn't much better. the fabric and print were great. i love jumpers but this one went back.",neg
"I bought this stylish and cozy sweater in ivory. i find that cable knit sweaters tend to add bulk, but this sweater creates a long, lean look. it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans, and the buttons on the cowl are a fun detail. every time i wear this, i get compliments on it.",pos

This cape is stunning! the perfect addition to any closet. it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans. the fur is so soft and the quality is superior. it has real fur hooks (four) to close it and the side pockets are adorable. definitely a buy and a bargain on sale!,pos
These leggings are super comfy. i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully. lately i've been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased. the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them.,pos
"I got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite, and love both. the length is perfect for my 5'3"" height and they're not skin tight, but fit like a glove (i have a 26"" waist and 34"" hips). the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if i'm not careful, but it's easy to flip it back. i think that's the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions, which say to hand wash only. i wish they had been made machine washa",pos

I ordered this dress in the red stripe and i love it. it is casual and easy to wear with flat sandals or booties. the dress is not really sheer like you might think from the picture and it included a nice knit under slip in a pale peachy pink shade that fits true to size as well. the dress has more of a soft woven cotton feel to it. the slip is not really necessary but nice that it is included. i looked at the blue color but it looks more like a tunic in the pictures. i think that the looks are,pos
The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described. i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not. not worth the money so i returned it.,neg

Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.,pos
These short are the best! the denim is incredibly soft. they go perfect with both casual and nice tops. i would wear them out everyday if i could.,pos
Great color and shape for all seasons. i was so elated to get this piece on sale! love it!,pos

"I love the color of this dress. it is not flattering, even though it should be. the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky. the lace is heavy but the silky panels aren't. so not flattering, it's just odd. and the fit is super huge, you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape. it could have been so cute, but was executed so poorly.",neg
I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo. i did not like the color.,neg

"Totally love this sweater - everything about it i find to match the model pics (fit, color, length). no dry cleaning required on this one, so i plan to get other colors to wear with leggings and skinnies fall through winter. i love that this is oversized without looking frumpy - it does have some shape to it and the knit falls perfects (not a heavy/chunky sweater...think soft mid-weight that you can layer with). worth full price!",pos
"There'd a reason this dress is all over instagram and like. it's stunning and beautiful, perfect for a wedding or event. the beading is beautiful and the tiers on the dress are more flattering than you'd expect , especially since it does have a bit of pouff to it. love it, 5 stats! i sized up so that it would be longer",pos

"I wanted to love this top, but it unfortunately did not work for me. the material has a nice weight and feel to it, and while i love the pattern, the shape leaves something to be desired. the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms, and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big. the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top. for reference, i am 5'10"" 140 lbs and typically a size 6. i wear a small in retailer clothes, and got a small in this top. i think an xs would have been to",neg
"This top is so cute. a little cropped, light for a sweater tank in my opinion, and runs a little big so i sized down one size. beautiful fabric and fit, the ruffles are such a fun addition! definitely recommend with a high waisted pant or skirt for work - so cute!",pos
"I love this dress! i do agree with the other reviewers - it does come up higher on the sides. it has a hi-lo hem style on me, but i'm short (5'3"") and got the petite xxs and it's not too short to wear as a dress. it's super cute!! if you're short(er) and don't mind showing a little leg, i highly recommend it :)",pos
I adore this top! it's comfortable and cute. the sleeve length is great for wearing bracelets. it's well-made. just perfect.,pos
"I have a few pair of charlie's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray, bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on don't size up. definitely recommend these pants.",pos
"Love this dress! the light fabric quality, color, and design all added to the grecian goddess feeling! my usual 0 fit perfectly, giving me a great shape and the length is great!",pos
This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual. (i'll wash it carefully just in case. it seems well made but i'd hate to snag the lace.),pos
"Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices, but i think this skort will sell out well before then.",pos
"This dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures! i'm petite, and so it's longer on me than it is on the model. i got a 4p and the waist was perfect! i thought it might look matronly as it was longer, but it looks classic. i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi, or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap. it's so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area, which is icing on the cake! i had absolutely no reason to buy it, but once i tried it",pos
"This cropped trouser is very high quality and perfect for summer. i ordered my usual size petite 4 (i am 5'2"" 115 lb) and i felt a little tight but since other previous reviews said they do stretch after wearing it, i decided to keep it. i hope they stretch out a little bit more. overall, i am very happy with my purchase.",pos
"I bought this cute ruffled tank in ivory to go with a silk wrap skirt i've had. it arrived today and it fits perfect. i am 5'5"", 125 lbs and small busted 34b. i bought size small after reading the reviews and glad i did because it fits perfect. the straps are not too long (a common problem for me), it's a nice length, nipped a bit a bit at the waist with slight flare below. also it does not gap under the arms which is much appreciated. a lot of thought went into this little top. i can wear it to",pos
"Sometimes i feel like i have to try on the dresses that sell out super fast, just out of curiosity. and sometimes, they're surprise hits, like this one. i tried on the purple/black/blue option, and i had to have it. it is boxy through the torso, but the length keeps it from being too cutesy--it's pretty short. i'm just 5'5"", and i'm not sure this is work appropriate without tights. i may have to try, though, as otherwise it's a great workable dress for summer--not too tight or revealing in the b",pos
"This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.",neg
"I wore it for the first time this week and received so many compliments. i bought the white one and it's a tiny bit see through, but still love it.",pos
"Super cute, casual top. i'm usually a medium and this fit perfectly (5'9"" 145 lbs). it's not quite as long as it is on the model, but cute nonetheless.",pos
"This top is so perfect for the fall... flowy, beautiful embroidery and paired with jeans and brown boots,gorgeous! wore it once and got a lot of compliments!  i'm 5'2"" 125 and ordered a size 4. 2 worked too but just a tad tight in the arms. :)",pos
There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,neg
These truly are tights and not leggings. they could not be worn alone but definitely great under skirts or dresses. they are thick and warm. i thought they ran a little big.,pos
Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!,neg
"I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist.",pos
"I almost walked past this until i saw it on the display mannequin. the shimmer is very subtle, but there, the picture here makes hte shirt look more like a grey shirt, but it is more ""sophisticated"" in person. very soft fabric, fitted on the ""wasit"", but romier on top, cowl is super flattering. usual sizze fit very nicely. highly recommend, i won't hev to tuck it in everytime i wear it :-# i think it can be dressed up #skirt# or down #jeans#, almost a basic t!",pos
"""does this sweater make my hips look big?"" my wife asked. this sweater was one of my christmas gifts to this fair maiden.
.
""no, love, it does not,"" i said, but i looked, to make sure my reflex was also correct. it's a beautiful sweater for my dear bride, mother of our three children, and no, it does not make her hips look big.

in fact, it draws out all her lovely lines and curves, just so. and she is a modest girl, so she wears a little undershirt so that her cleavage is somewhat...um...suppre",pos
Great cut and high quality fabric. the top gives you a nice hourglass shape and i love the way it hangs half-way down your butt.,pos

Loves it!! this is my new favorite top. it's pretty...it's perfect:-) cannot find any bad to say about it.,pos

"This dress is adorable! it fits loose and is not at all fitted, with the exception of the under cami lining. the picture showing front and back is being pulled to fit. :/ it fits like the model wearing the purple. my local store was out of my normal size so i sized up which really made no difference at all. the biggest difference would be the under cami. the dress is flowy and airy. one of the best casual dresses retailer has had in a long time. obviously, the blue is sold out till may. this can b",pos
I love this sweatshirt! new favorite! it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit... love the little inspirational quote... and it's the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in! so stinking soft! got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school!!!,pos
"Love this skirt, easy to wear and very flattering. looks better in person, i saw it at the store and bought it; when i looked at it on-line i didn't realize it was the same skirt. this is a ""go to"" skirt, comfy and sexy all in one! even wore it to the airport with a pair of boots and sweater....super comfortable and still looked nice! great purchase!",pos
"I ordered this shirt last week, it's beautiful!!!!! it's even prettier than the photo. i'm 5.3 120lbs ,i ordered the petite 6 and it fit perfectly!!!! i wish it came in more colors, i'd order another one in a minute!",pos
"The pants are everything i expected and much more! the material is a delicious and light weight. the colors are beautiful-white base with jade green and black design. there is a very comfortable elastic band waist with tie. i am 5'9"" and ordered the longer length and they are just to the ground. i weigh 140 and have a slim figure and the medium is a very comfortable fit. i would highly recommend these if you like looks that are up to date and comfy-these are a win-win!",pos
"Noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store. i am 5'5"" 135lbs, with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops. i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit. the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up, as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness. i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots. as another reviewer suggested, i think a denim shirt will look great underneath. rated a good in quality b",pos
"I ordered the gold in size xl. it fits true to size, matching the online photos. the color & details are prettier in person. such a comfortable tee. it's washed/dried well too. i hope they make more colors for this fall. it's been a great basic!",pos
"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5'6"" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.",neg
"Let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress. i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so i'd better listen up. and because i really like the other bailey 44 dress i own. wow! i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this. i love it, my husband loves it and it's comfy. for reference i did size down and went with a petite. had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on",pos
"I love this dress! it is perfect for a wedding, brunch with friends, or even work. it is beautifully made and is comfortable. i have it in the yellow colorway, but i am tempted to go back and purchase it in the purple colorway as well.",pos
"Love the diving beauty version, it is charming without being too ""cutsie"" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in, tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!",pos
"These pants are more like 9"" not 10"". i was very dissappointed. the color is great and so is the fabric.
if you look more closely at the model the pants don't fit her either!! they are too small! i haven't decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight. i am a 31 so far but these pants are like a 30. i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer",neg
I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri,pos
"Dressed up or dressed down, this summer dress is perfect. the skirt is a lot of fabric, like others have said, but it's part of what makes this dress fun; and because the top is fitted, i find it very flattering because you can adjust the tie around the waist to make it fitted. that being said, the design sort of threw me off when it arrived in the mail because the waist as well as straps around the shoulders are adjustable; at first it looked like a sack, but when it's on and adjusted it will l",pos
I bought the lavender one and i'm so glad i did. the sweater looks prettier in person and it's super soft! the back detailing makes this one not your average v-neck sweater. i highly recommend this to anyone!,pos
This has quickly become my go-to cardigan! it's light which will make it great for the spring and summer nights. i got it in the rose... and loved it so much i bought the olive too. bought a small- fits perfectly! arm length is great too.,pos
Confortable and looks great how ever you wear it.,pos
"This really is a gorgeous jacket! i would give it 4.5 stars just because sometimes it can be a bit unflattering in the tummy area (poofs out a bit) at certain times, but i had to remind myself that is the style of the coat. i am petite and curvy on bottom, so this could just be me. tried wearing with a skinny belt and it looked cute, i think i will try both ways. seems very warm. beautful colors and the material is soft and not itchy at all! excited because versatile for everyday wear but also l",pos
"I saw this dress in the store and immediately grabbed it. i think that if i'd only seen it online i wouldn't have looked at it twice. in person, the fabric is so beautiful, a shining and classy velvet crinkle that could go way way dressy with the right accessories. this dress runs large, like all of floreat's items. i am 5'2"" 110# and normally wear an xs or 0, but had to size down to xxs petite for the right fit (like on the model). the only drawback is dry clean only. based on the content of th",pos

as one reviewer mentioned it seems to be meant to be worn with a shirt underneath. i've tried with longer sleeved tops and with tank tops and they both look great - especially white.

"This top is so nice i bought it in 2 colors. washes well but does need to be ironed.

"This jacket is pretty cute in person. it is a nice thick gauzy material. the black is more like a dark washed gray color. while i do like the jacket, i feel like it is cut a little wide... maybe i should have ordered a size down. i usually wear a combination of 6s and 8s and am usually between a small and medium. i ordered this in a medium, but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area. i'm returning the jacket for now, but might reorder in a small another time.",pos
"I like these pants a lot. got one pair in black
and one pair in holly. the green holly are just a perfect green, so nice for the season. they are very comfy and feel right all day without any sagging.

"I bought this 'nightgown' to wear as a winter maternity dress. it really fit the bill!! the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well. there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress. it would be way too hot! it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter. i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer, the length was not awkward and kept it from being to",pos

i found the material to be very nice, despite one of the reviewers comments.
it is a sheath that is not skin tight but shows curves - great for dancing.

This is a really great dress - especially for the holiday season - you can do work and post work events with it easily. i ordered a large but it fit me more like a medium. it is very comfortable and the quality feels great. boots give it the day look and a nice set of beige high heels gave it a great evening look.,pos

"I really wanted to love this dress, but it just didn't fit in anyway. i ordered an xs petite, and it was very large. the lacing in the back is completely useless, and that's what i liked about the dress. i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top (because of chest) and then lace more tightly near the waist. it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering. beautiful fabric, great color combo, bad fit.",neg
This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering. i would not recommend.,neg
Super cozy! now that the colder weather is coming i will likely be wearing these every night relaxing at home!!,pos
This skirt is a great fit for curvy women. i highly recommend it.,pos
"I just love sleeping on snow sweaters and this one is no exception. it's soft and cozy and very warm. i do have sensitive skin, so i found this a bit itchy right away, but that went away after i wore it for a bit. this is oversized, but in a great way. you could size down if you wanted something a bit more fitted. sleeves are long and pre-cuffed. sweater hit me mid-lower thigh.",pos
"Bought this for my daughter in law's birthday. it's just a beautiful, feminine design, well made, nice fabric.. she can wear this for work or for lunch or an evening out. very versatile.",pos
"I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves, and i'm not disappointed. it is a classic t, with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves. it is not fitted, which is what i was looking for. it also covers my bum, which i don't always like hanging out there. in all, it's perfect for my needs. i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too!",pos
"I love this dress! the design is simple, colors and patterns are eye-catching but not over the top. cutting is perfect for me and very flattering. the material is flowy not clingy. it is a piece of easy, no-hassle garment that i would love to wear everyday and make it my uniform. seriously, it doesn't get better than that. if they make more of this style with different colors and patterns, i will just buy them blindly.

a word of caution: the dress does have slightly bigger armholes so some pe",pos
Beautiful sweater - cool enough to wear on a florida evening and it will be perfect for vacation. the sleeves hit right above the wrist bone (exactly as shown on the model) and i really like that. sheer fabric but still a sweater - you will need a cami or tank underneath. can't wait to wear it!,pos
"I just love this top, it has a flattering cut, fun summer colors! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt. both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down. perfect for traveling. only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back. highly recommend!! stock more pieces like this retailer!",pos
"I usually love tops like this, i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in.",neg
"This is the perfect dress! for summer, fall, winter or spring, it is flattering and looks cute with booties, flip flops, brogues or barefoot! runs a teeny bit large - i wear a small to medium and the small is perfect! i might just buy the other color it comes in!!!!",pos
Love the dress. runs a little big. i ordered a size down than i normally wear and it fit. versatile too--i even wore it to the office with a black blazer over it and got lots of compliments!,pos
"Let me start off my saying that i hate pants. i will wear dresses and skirts whenever possible to avoid them. however, i found these at my local retailer and just had to try them on because the pattern was so adorable. i have another pair of pilcro shorts that i love because they are so comfortable and have so much stretch to them that they don't make me crazy like other pants do. these were no exception! i love everything about them and am going to have a hard time not wanting to wear them every",pos
"I have a few pairs of pilcro pants and they have yet to disappoint. the fit, the style and the quality is just perfect for me. i know i can go to my size and expect a perfect fit every time.",pos
"I love this jacket. the color is what drew me to it and it looks just like the picture. as far as sizing goes, i'm usually a medium but i ordered a small and it fit well. i feel that if i had ordered a medium it would look a little too puffy for my taste. the small gives me a more fitted look.",pos
This sweater in the yellow caught my eye several times and i finally tried it on! so cute and perfect for transitional weather. threw it over the striped top that was hanging in the changing room. ended up with both!,pos
Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size,pos
"This hoodie has a lovely, flattering drape and fits true-to-size (m for me), and is light but quite warm. the cottony nylon layers along the front panels and hood add style. it will be warm enough as an outer layer on a slightly brisk day or indoors in cooler weather. i was going to opt for the blue, but in the store, the light gray ~ which is a bit darker and more marled than online (at least on my monitor) ~ looked really lovely and seemed more versatile.",pos
Just received this dress in the mail and i'm in love.  it's beautiful and fits so well.  i was a little hesitant ordering a yellow dress but i'm so happy that i did.  ??,pos
"This sweater is absolutely lovely. i bought it in the sky color which is so pretty, the picture just doesn't do it justice! the yarn is super soft and it seems as though it will be plenty warm this winter. i also love the retro 70's look. a definite keeper.",pos
This is a beautiful dress. i love the bohemian style and flow. works well with dressing up or dressing down. very quality.,pos
A must have sweater with great details. it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans. i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion.,pos
"I purchased this dress in the raspberry for my best friend's bridal shower and it was such a hit! i got it for the $60 sale price with the additional 40% off sale items that retailer loves so much- it came to $41! i paired it with a chunky gold necklace and it was adorable! so many compliments! i'm typically a medium through and through and this fit me true to size as well. 5'6"", between 135-140lbs. the cut of the dress fit me perfectly and the material is amazing. i'd definitely purchase this!",pos
"Got this dress in the mail today, and it's definitely a keeper. the material is high quality, and i can see wearing this dress on all but the coldest days of winter. it'll be great to wear today in 90 degree weather, and with a cardigan and booties, it will easily transition into cool weather. the colors, patterns, and lace are all just beautiful. for reference, i always order xs for loose fitting dresses, and a size 4 for close fitting styles. the xs in this dress is perfect.",pos
"Good fit, quality, similar to the brand's other jeans.",pos
"This dress is beautiful. it is tts, but since it is so flowy, is not form fitting. i am petite (5'4"" 115lbs) and this is a lot of dress for a shorter/smaller person. if it were less flowy, i would keep it. the design, material and overall product is, however, amazing! this dress would be a beautiful addition to any closet.",pos
"Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous, it's a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it's still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric, but that's what i was expecting, and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley.",pos
"I had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale. when i pulled it out of the package, i could not believe how soft it was. literally, as a cloud. think of the softest, fluffiest baby blanket. also, the cut is extremely flattering. i am 5'7"", 135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly, flowing, but not boxy. love it!",pos
The shirt is beautiful but slightly long. it is see thru and you do need to wear a cami underneath.,pos
"Love it! the pants is absolutely beautiful, rich material, it's not your cheap jogger!
i am really considering buying a second pair just in case i used my a little to much.
fits perfect, i am 5'4"" 114lbs and purchase the regular small.",pos
"First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.",pos
Love the fit. nice and warm and good quality material.,pos
The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint!  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model.  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me.  i normally wear a 4 but bought a 6 in this dress - i am a 34c and i felt the 4 was a little tight across the chest - otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size.,pos
"Wanted to love this- i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone. but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite ""not keeping this."" the side zipper- a complaint by many, really made it uncomfortable. also, the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd. loved the material and definitely the green print. but i knew i would never wear it. just looked blah.",neg
These leggings are perfect!! i normally struggle to find pants that are comfortable and flattering but these are exactly what i've been looking for. they are so versatile - they can be worn for a lazy day in or a night on the town. a new staple in my wardrobe!,pos
I love these shorts. i don't understand why they aren't sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!,pos
"Love this top. have two of them. they are comfy, light-weight and extremely flattering. love!",pos
"This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts! jeans work well, too, and during cooler seasons, i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm.

the fit of this top is not true to size, for it runs large, but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings, i noticed, add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.

as a whole, this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material",pos
"I just received this dress and i feel like a goddess in it! it is perfect for graduations, weddings, romantic dinners, tropical va cations....heck, i'll wear it to the grocery store! i love it that much!

i am 5'7"" with a 34c bust.....i have this dress in a size 4 and it fits very well. this dress is slim cut from the shoulder down to the waist. the dress length hits me at the lower calf, just like the model online. i think the armholes are cut a little high...this being said; this dress would",pos
I love how comfortable this fits and the fantastic pops of color. goes with just about every slip and tank dress i own! a perfect lightweight dress or layering vest with my hot weather wardrobe. can't wait to take this with me on vacation!,pos
"I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 5'8, 135, and in a size 6 i don't find this shows my stomach at all. it's really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15% off and i think it's a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.",pos
"This top is fabulous! so comfy and the lace at the top is just right. it does run a little big but drapes so well it looks fine...i got the plum but tempted to get the ivory,,,especially at the sale price! a steal...",pos
Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend. super flattering and soft. big thumbs up!,pos
"I love this skirt. unfortunately, no petite sizing was available when it was affordable (on sale). i purchased the 6 regular (based on ""small waist"" reviews) thinking i'll just have it shortened. did not realize there are 4 layers and tailoring would have cost $60+. was considering anyway, but when pinned up, the skirt lost its fullness and i didn't care for that look. if anyone has a 6 petite they want to off-load or exchange with me for a 6 regular, am very happy to do so. this is one skirt i",pos
This precious skirt is a treasure chest of soft bronze fabric circles scattered like coins at the bottom of a fountain. the circles are a bronze color and cannot be felt through the skirt net. it's finely finished and simply a nice piece for dinner out or a day in the office. i received many compliments on my first wearing.,pos
"I am normally a 4, but they only had the white in size 2, so i tried it. i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow, therefore has plenty of fabric. it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear. i don't know how to explain it, but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse. much better in reality than on the picture.",pos
"I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft, but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear.",pos
"I really like this top. while it looks somewhat like just a t-shirt, it is not. the fabric is light and soft, it has a great texture feel, it dioes not feel like a regular cotton shirt. the print is lovely. i am very pleased.",pos
"Purchased in the light grey and was so excited, i wore it the very next day. the back detailing and pocket make it more unique than a regular tee and the fabric is slightly heavy (in a good way) so it hangs beautifully. easily can be dressed up or down. new favorite tee!",pos
"These are flattering and the colors are really nice. they're a bit tighter than other pilcro pants i've tried, but the material is stretchy.",pos
This top is a cross between a shirt and sweater. great length and very soft. it does run a little large so size down if you are n the fence. hangs nicely in the back.,pos
"I've got the post-baby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest i've looked in a long time! fitted, but skimming where i don't want to be accentuated - it's a rare dress that can pull this off! the cleavage is there, so i think it's more of a night dress, but i'd wear it with a sweater during the day. very comfortable.",pos
I love this dress! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun. i would have never picked this dress out. i didn't look awesome on the hanger. but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time. but i couldn't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress. so i did what any girl would do and bought it online. it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesn't do the dres,pos
"So happy with this jacket! i have looked for what feels like forever for a vegan leather jacket that is (1) long enough in the sleeves and (2) wide enough in the shoulders without being bulky through the body. i found it ran true to size. my usual large for well, xl was a little big. the material is beautiful and soft and the colors are great. i ordered the honey and cognac and love them both.",pos
"I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium, but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale, the price is reasonable.",pos
I really love this top. they show it's as a bathing suit cover up in the pics but i will wear mine as a top over a cami. it's beautiful and looks expensive. (it is). had to exchange my usual size for one smaller.,pos
"This dress looked ok in the hanger, but oh my on was so much better. quality is great, i love the fabric and that it has pockets.
i'm 5'8 and normally a ddd usually a large too...so i worried about the size - the medium fits great everywhere",pos
"I love this jacket. it has great structure and lays nicely, while still have knit arms and a lining. don't try this on if you aren't prepared to buy it because it's amazing. color is more of an olive than a khaki to me as it appears in this picture. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly. definitely consider this as an investment piece across many seasons.",pos
"The perfect tee. this is exactly what i have been looking for. flattering fit,looks great dressed up or down and has just a touch of unique detail without being over the top, the top is just slightly thin but can definitely be worn without a cami underneath. this reminds me of old retailer tops from several years ago that i just loved and wore to death.",pos
"This dress is as cute as represented in the picture. the adjustable ties on the sides allow your dress to be form fitting or a looser, more casual look. the colors of the dress and the beading are beautiful. the dress looks great paired with a pair of black ankle boots!",pos
This skirt is so cozy and comfortable. it is form fitting but has a lot of give/stretch. the material feels high quality and heavy without being overly hot. i am sure this will be a go to skirt.,pos
"I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.",neg
I'm not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small. in my opinion it runs pretty large. i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small. i do have a small bust (36b) and skinny arms so maybe that's why? regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down. it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket!,pos
"I'm so glad that i took a chance on these; they're fabulous! i wasn't sure about sizing since my local store didn't carry them, but as a wider-hipped 14 i went with the xl. it was the perfect fit and i couldn't be more pleased. the skirt is the perfect touch since it gives my flat booty the illusion of shape and provides a little coverage (not that you'd need it- there's no show-through whatsoever.) love!",pos
"Absolutely love this dress. it is perfect for the summer. yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is. the style is so unique, love the pleats. i am 146lbs, 5'6"" 36dd and the size 8 fits perfectly. not tight through the arms holes or the bust area. the dress hangs perfectly, you can dress it up or where it to run errands.",pos
"This dress is everything i imagined it would be. lightweight, flattering on my hourglass shape, and comfortable. i am a true 4p in retailer dresses (5'4"" 32d, 27 inch waist, 28 denim size) and purchased this dress in a 6 regular. i imagine the petite size would be way too short, as the regular size hit about 3 inches above my knee. might be a problem for taller girls. definitely size up on this one to avoid button gaping.",pos
"I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5""2"", broad shoulders, 120 lb)",pos
"I really am happy with this purchase! i am only 5'1 and this will be a perfect dress for me, the cuts hit at just the right spot!",pos
"Love it! this suit is high quality and comfortable. it's a little tricky to get on but once it's on, it's perfect. i have a small chest and the fit of the cups and twisted fabric makes me feel totally comfortable. i usually wear two pieces, in fact this is my first one piece since i was ten, and i love it.",pos
"This top is beautiful! it is comfortable - soft and relaxed without being ""baggy."" colors are just as seen on the website...if not prettier. it is a versatile and flattering top; tucked in or not; sleeves rolled up or not; i love it!",pos
I'm either a medium or large in retailer tops. i was able to wear a medium in this top. the color is vibrant and the material is soft and light. it will be a great spring and summer top. can't wait to wear it.,pos
"This tee is a great everyday staple.  it is comfortable and it also drapes very well.  i am 5ft 2in, 100lbs, 34b and i got this in xxs regular.  the length is perfect for leggings/skinny jeans, and it also looks really cute with a side knot in front. i have this is navy, green and black.  the navy color is brighter in person and in my opinion, looks better.  you can't go wrong. planning on getting the grey and pink one as well.",pos
"This is the weirdest, greatest material. it feels as soft and as buttery as leather, but doesn't look like leather. it looks more like coated denim. only lighter. and stretchy. so you don't get the vibe you get from the vast majority of vegan leather--thick, rubbery junk trying to masquerade as the real thing.

also gorgeous: the cut. it's straight and slim, but with pleats so hip-less ladies like me look like we have some shape.

i got my regular size, and they fit beautifully, but they are not",pos
Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.,pos
"I purchased this for a late summer wedding that i was invited to last minute and i can't wait to wear it! i got it on sale with an additional percentage off and for the price it is a steal. like all of tracy reese designs it is so cute and feminine. it runs just a tad bit on the larger side so the medium fit my size 10 figure perfectly (i tried on the large and it was too big and too long for me). the medium length was perfect for my height (5""6).",pos
"This is soft to the touch and just beautiful.
it is a little roomy, but true to size. i love it that way. 
totally on trend for the season",pos
Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.,pos
"This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7"" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!",pos
"This is such a great top that when my cat snagged it i bought a second version to wear in public and kept the snagged version to wear around the house or for working out. it is super comfortable and can be worn with so many things. definitely on the more casual side but you can dress it up slightly w/ jeans and booties, or it can be worn w/ leggings, jeans and tennis shoes, etc. i also bought the coral color in addition to the blue. if you're on the fence i would say you can't go wrong with buyi",pos
"This is a great light weight tank. true to size, but size up if you prefer a baggier fit, size down for a closer fit. your preference for fit should be your guide. (i prefer a closer fit, so i choose a xs, i am a 6-8 in tops) the arm holes are slim and high so you are completely covered in all sizes. excellent drape, the twist in the front is just perfect! looks great with jeans, print joggers, and even wide leg pants. i imagine it would be fantastic with a pencil skirt - denim perhaps. hope it",pos
"Quality is great, fits very well at waste, i am 5'4 135lb bought size 8p and it's good... i would require wear heels as it reaches and sits on the floor. they are more fall/spring/winter pants as material quite thick. overall, i am happy with them",pos
"I ordered this in an xs and it fits well. however, if you have a bigger bust this top may be a problem. i wear a b cup and it fits me well.",pos
"Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size, i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!",pos
"This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.

the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall.",pos
Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.,neg
Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath. unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics i've ever seen. would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric. to me it wasn't worth the money even on sale.,neg
"I think of tracy reese as running small, and usually size up, but the 8 was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly. i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection. please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage, so you need the right bra.",pos
I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!,pos
"I really wanted to love this, but it was just too voluminous to be flattering. i am typically a size 10 or 12 in dresses and jumpsuits, and the medium was billowing around me. also,the elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way. it had to go back.",neg
"I received this jacket in an 8. fits great with room . i am a 34dd chest for reference as i was not sure if i needed a 10, but the 8 is perfect. see my pictures as i feel the website photos are more bright as the actual jacket is more muted. buttons are very nice but the pocket flaps hit right at the boob area so it my bother some . very high quality, lined and will look great over some retailer dresses in the same color way i purchased last year. depending on the season this jacket would do fine",pos
"Nice chunky knit cotton tank with cut-out shoulders. sporty looking. armholes are the right size and bra doesn't show. no holes to see through, even in white. tts. i took my usual medium. falls to about hip bone, approx 20"" from shoulder. not tight, not baggy, but has a nice comfortable drape. i got in white. best to put it on before applying makeup. this goes great with black and white print pilazzo pants! love this top.",pos
Very flattering suit. embroidery is unique and the cut flatters.,pos
"Gorgeous pattern, even prettier in person! runs slightly large in my opinion, could size down. nice to have as a petite option.",pos
Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.,pos
"These are the perfect vintage-looking high rise jeans, without the risk inherent in buying vintage. for reference, i am 5'2"", 108 lbs and usually a 26 in ag. these fit me perfect in a size 26 and were a great length for booties and flats. they fit me at versus above the ankle.",pos
This top completely fell short for me. i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting. in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isn't even noticeable but in person it is very prominent...and not in a good way. the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well. did not work well with my large bust (34d). returned.,neg
I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.,neg
"Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy, hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!",pos
"Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment. the color is wonderful, the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but that's where the compliments end. it's an itchy, cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso. i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece. so bummed. so so bummed.",neg
"True to form, this retailer sweater hits the mark! it's light weight, stylish, great for a shorter person like myself, and has cute detailing. the sleeves are little long, but i push them up anyway and the cream color i bought goes with everything. the xs size is more comfortable and flattering than the s if you are short. i would have bought the bluish gray color of this sweater, too, but already own a similarly shaded and textured sweater from retailer from last year...love that one,",pos
This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line. simply stunning. was reluctant to pay high price but worth it. will get much wear.,pos
"Size 8 always, 36c and i have broad shoulders...i found this true to size. the colors pop more and there is a cleavage alert, just letting you girls know. this is very figure flattering, especially with my body frame, it accentuates the right spots.",pos
"I love this top. i got the blue, the colors are deep and just beautiful
i'm normally a large, so i feel this top runs large. i got the medium and it fits perfect 
it is long, i'm 5'6"" and it hits the bottom of my butt. 
you won't be disappointed, try this top",pos
I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :),pos
I saw this sweater at the store and instantly love it. it run large. i am 5'8 and 120 pounds and usually a size s in most retailer tops. i had to go with xxs on this one so def size down.,pos
"There may be no inner lining, but it is a gorgeous bra! and so comfortable! the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning. it is absolutely true to size. 34c fit like a glove. a winner!",pos
"I purchased this dress in the green, and while the print and material were lovely, the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top. the billowly bottom made it look like a bag. i am 5ft, 36d and 29"" waist and the size 2 fit, which makes me think this runs large! i'll be returning this dress.",neg
I love this top! it is long enough for my torso and arms. i am thinking of ordering in another color.,pos
This top is too boxy and has too much going on. it should have no buttons or different ones.,neg
"Nice quality, details, and i like the looser cut (works well on this blouse).",pos
"I got a m in this top and was a little scared but i absolutly love this top, i was debating on it and then caught it on the 30% off sale, my first retailer purchase and it definitely won't be my last! great quality, so comfortable, and very cute!",pos
"I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests. i ordered the burgundy color in an xs (my usual, 2) and the color is lovely and deep. i absolutely love it. the ribbed design is comfortable. the neck drapes as shown, so it is not constricting at all.",pos
Love love love this skirt. i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute. once i tried it on i fell in love. i purchased both black and blue. super flattering and true to size. its a must have for sure.,pos
This is the perfect duster! transitions you perfectly from summer to fall without being an overly heavy piece. simple and classic! i know i will get a lot of wear out of this item!,pos
"My local retailer had one of these skirts in store, presumably a return. i was so excited when i found out that it was in my size! i'm 5'7 and usually a 2 or 4 at retailer and bought the 2 for reference. the skirt is made of a heavy fabric and the pockets are lined with paisley fabric! the seams look really sturdy and the skirt moves well. it's very cute and super easy to wear. i styled it with brown boots, an retailer belt and a white button down. great for spring/summer xx",pos
"I grabbed this dress in green when i saw it on sale (plus there was an additional percentage off that day online) and they had my size. while it's slightly loose in the body of the dress, that will probably tighten up after the first wash since it's rayon - then it should fit like a glove. i didn't experience the zipper issue - there is a hook & eye at the top to keep the fabric together, and the zipper was stiff so it won't unzip of its own volition. it is a tad bulky at the top of the zipper w",pos
"I love the color combo, and the design make me feel tall and thin. i know this is going to be very cool to wear on a hot day. i like it with my white jeans, and you can wear it a number of ways. i love this brand, i still wear the plaid from last spring. it's a got to have.",pos
"I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable",pos
"I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. 

my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.",pos
"I meant to order both red and blue and added to red in my basket by accident, oops, meant to be? the color is very nice, not too bright holiday red, but nice rich red. the cut is very flattering too. i didn't expect to love it as much on. i ordered the xxs p, length was not too high/cropped, perfect. the asymmetrical hem gives some visual interest to the sweater, so does the fun neckline with keyhole on the side... fun take on a sweater... for me, the fabric was comfortable. i am 115 lbs, 30dd,",pos
"I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine. i tried to make it work but i just wasn't feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring. unfort, it wasn't for me.",neg
I almost always return dresses after trying them at home but not this one! i love it and can't wait to get it back from the dry cleaner. the shoulders are really stylish and the dress is super comfortable. it has pockets which is also a bonus.  i told my husband that i want to bring it to a seamstress and have it duplicated in another fabric because i love it so much.,pos
"The dress is absolutely beautiful in person. the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted. it's unique and sure to turn heads. being 5'2"" i tried on the small petite. this size is usually perfect (lengthwise) for me. however this dress was about 2"" too long. another complaint is the style of the top half. the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half. the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am. not a good look on anyone.",neg
Perfect for end of summer going into fall. very soft and pairs great with skinnies and sandals or booties. still trying to find a sweater to layer it with. runs true to size. i am an xs/0 and got the xs. i was a little worried because i am so petite i usually swim in tops like this. it fits perfectly and comfortably.,pos
"What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt, and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes, i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.",neg
I bought it in black and cream! great weight. soft fabric. beautiful lace.,pos
Love this white jean jacket! love the stretchy fit.,pos
"I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailer's recent 20% off sale. i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate, but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night. they both seemed to be just what i was looking for. i ordered a 4 regular and a 6 regular, as i am usually in between sizes. the 4 was definitely too small. the 6 fit, technically, but was very ill fitting. not only is the dress itself short, but it is very short-waisted. i am only 5'3"", but it fe",neg
Cute top. fits short but roomy. will get a lot of use in my wardrobe.,pos
"Adorable peasant fitting top.  not too voluminous, just right for over jeans, and really cute with shorts.  the detail makes it wearable for dress up or down, and the cut is classic!",pos
I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms! thank you retailer! i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect! the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion! the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts.,pos
This shirt is extremely soft and fits well. great length and perfect casual shirt for fall.,pos
Gorgeous suit! one of the most well made suits i've ever owned. sexy yet provides great coverage. do note the sizing is per australian standards. i had to order a size up.,pos
"Love this dress! i can't say enough about it. comfortable, stylish, packable! doesn't wrinkle at all. i love it. i bought the neutral and the turquoise. only planned on keeping one but i love it so much i'm keeping both. good dress for fall/winter to wear with flats or tights and boots. can easily be dressed up or worn casual. i am 5'1"" 115 lbs and bought the xs petite. perfect fit. a great price point especially with the 25% off dresses.",pos
"This top is a perfect example of why retailer is heaven. the attention to detail is stunning and it drapes beautifully. i am 5'6"" and 140lbs with an average build. an xs fits me perfectly. this top is very flowy. i could wear it until about six months into a pregnancy, yet it is flattering even though i am not currently adding to the human race. it's an investment, but it's high quality and worthy of the price tag.",pos
"This top may be labeled as a part of a sleep set but i threw a cami under it, styled it with skinny jeans and a top knot and this became a very effortless/chic so cal look. love that pop of hot pink too! i went up a size for a little extra wiggle room across my shoulders. overall this is a great summer top!",pos
"I love the fit of these pants -- they're the perfect slim black pants. however, i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one, but multiple places. disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product, especially since the pants fit amazingly and don't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do. i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product.",neg
"I hadn't seen this sweater/jacket online or in store before shopping today. i purchased the ivory. it fits without being bulky whether or not it is zipped. great fit- true to size.the asymmetric zipper is a stylish detail. the pockets are well placed also. it is a perfect spring weight jacket or, i suspect, a comfy fall to winter sweater.",pos
"Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece, but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless, thin, beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light, breezy, go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel, this might be good for you, but it's too thin for just about anything else.",neg
"Love this tee! lightweight, airy and comfy. i think it fits true to size. so soft and summery. can't wait to wear it this summer!",pos
Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point!!!,pos
"You do not want to know how many cropped, wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right, apparently. these are great: comfy, make my legs look cute, not chopped off, they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.

This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer,neg
"The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size, as they had been sold out.",pos
I couldn't resist this basic white button down with the cute side buttons that added some interest. i bought my usual size large and it fit perfectly. the soft substantial fabric from cloth and stone never disappoints. i love the longer cut since i'm 5-10 and love a long shirt to hide the belly pudge. the blue is darker than the online picture shows and i'll probably be going back for that but at almost $100 i'm hoping it'll go on sale.,pos
"I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning. the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop! i am 5'3""/36b/108 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under 5' and/or very short waisted! the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all evening...and got tons of compliments as well!",pos
"I wore this top right out of the package i loved it so much. i am 5'8"" small busted and size 4 was great. the sleeves hit me perfectly. the pleated detail in the back is flattering as well. my daughter now wants her own top. it would be nice to have a second color option.",pos
"Love love this piece! for the moment i saw it i noted anther catalog, i knew i had to try it on... im 5' 9"" and 130 and the xs fits me perfectly. i love the way it is tailored. it is also lined with a nice fabric. overall a very well made summer go to piece!",pos
I saw this in the store and immediately loved it even before trying on. the style is classic and the fit is perfect. the material is soft and comfortable. it hugs without clinging. i tried on the black in s and the green in xs and went with the green. different shoes and accessories will dress this up or down. i plan to travel with it several times this summer. it will be a great option to wear on the plane and arrive looking chic.,pos
"The turquoise print is absolutely stunning. i love the feel of the fabric, the drape",pos
"I bought the green pair in store and loved their fit. i ended up buying the rust color online too! i'm 5'3"" 125 and i went down a size to a 26. cause they will stretch a little. perfect length for my height too great with wedges or boots.",pos
"Many thanks to all previous reviewers that convinced me to try this blazer. i bought it in navy and it is absolutely perfect. i love its simple lines, softness, and quality of the material. it transitions easily from work to casual. i paired it with mirabella lace top and skinny jeans for a look that is both practical and beautiful.",pos
"These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering.

i highly recommend this timeless piece.",pos
"I saw the shirt on the retailer website and new i had to have it. when it arrived, it was perfectly draped, light and airy, and incredibly soft and comfortable.  it's perfect to throw on with yoga pants for errands or dress up a bit a casual night out with friends. would buy this again in several different colors if they were offered. 9/10.",pos

Little boxy in the mid section; very very elegant and beautiful design!,pos
"These are the perfect wide legs.  they aren't overly wide (a common problem for petite women like myself, who cannot pull off the really wide styles), and they are nicely fitted in the top.  the fabric is a great weight, neither too heavy nor too light so they lay nicely.

Warning-- it's totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless you're very confident in your mid-section you can wear a bandeau or just a bra. it's definitely a lounge/ leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out. it's lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top. i live in this over the weekends. i am a larger gal-- broader shoulder and purchased an xl. it's true to size and roomy.,pos
As-advertised crop sweater is a great length. design is an iron-on velvet texture rather than intarsia. weight of sweater is great for transitional weather.,pos

This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.,neg

"Comfortable, great fit and beautiful colors. the interesting thing is that in this picture, it shows the dress just below the knee. i am 5'5"" so totally average height, but the dress falls just above my ankles., which i personally think is way more attractive. not sure if there are two versions of this dress, but be careful if you buy online. i got mine in the glendale store.",pos

i would highly recommend!!!",pos

I purchased the orange version (definitely orange - not red) before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather. the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person. the fabric is very soft and hangs well. look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan. i own a few akemi + akin tops and always get a s. this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s.,pos

I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!,pos

"There aren't enough great words to describe this dress. tried on the black one in store yesterday and knew immediately i was going to purchase.  everything is perfection - not tight slip underneath that even has the strap snap closures to hold it in place at the shoulders, not too low cut, hits right above knee so not too short, light weight, flattering, etc!!  and machine washable! can dress up or down. could even wear to work with a jacket or cardi. can wear all seasons - can't wait to pair wi",pos
I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!,pos
Heavier fabric than it looks but cute and versatile. flattering as well!,pos
I loved this tunic. dress up or down layer it with a cropped leather jacket and booties. i bit on the long side so if you are short it might make you look stumpy but really cute with leggings or skinny jeans.,pos
Very cozy wrap!  the material is so soft.   find myself grabbing this anytime i am chilly day and night.  i offen find my daughter wrapped up in it too!  and with the arm holes it stays on.  very pleased.,pos
"I love this dress and will be purchasing it in other patterns. the fit is incredibly flattering and the fabric is lovely. doesn't wrinkle, easy to wash and wear. i am 5'7, 190lbs, bottom heavy with a 38c bra size. i purchased the size large and it fits me perfectly (though perhaps a little bit snug in the waist). if i wanted a looser fit, an xl would probably work though might be a bit loose on the top. the low back hits just above my bra strap, but does in fact cover all straps. for reference,",pos
"I did not like the fit of this. as another reviewer stated, it is not a swing tunic. it hangs fairly straight. i don't have large hips. i'm 5'8"" and 120 lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering. i returned it immediately.",neg
I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding. it is absolutely gorgeous! the actual fabric is much more detailed in person. sizing is accurate. the dress is knee length. there is a little tulle underneath to give it the a-line shape.,pos
"Really cute and comfortable. i have worn these a couple of times and get several compliments! worth every penny, and now they are on sale!",pos
"I just received this top and love it. the fabric is soft and comfy. it is just as pictured, no surprises. lace-up fronts are a hot item for spring. for reference, i am 5'7 and weigh #127. the xs fits perfectly.",pos
"Very disappointed in this top. i have a short waist, and it was still too short for me. :-(",neg
"I tried this on twice in nyc and loved this jacket. it is so much cuter in person. my only concern is whether the mesh fabric will hold up over time and at this price point it needs to last more than one season. it has adorable embroidery on it, the colors are vibrant. you need to see this in person.",pos
This dress is so beautiful in person. i actually am currently wearing it with jeans and i get so many compliments on it. this picture on the website does not really do it justice. very flowy beautiful top/dress.,pos
"Love ag jeans!! a little on the pricey side...but so worth it. the harper style is just enough higher wasted so i can actually bend over and not worry about anyone seeing anything other than my jeans :) but not too high waisted. these jeans keep their shape still with a little strestch to them. i am 5'5,, and 111 lbs and if not wearing under boots would have to a0 alter or b) wear as these are in the picture because they'd be too long for me. but i would purchase these all over again. love these",pos
"This top arrived today, and after trying it on, i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is 100% without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture. the fit is designed to be loose, so i don't think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down. i've included a picture of how it fits naturally, and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back. it's still a cute shirt, just not the flattering top i was expecting. i'm debating on",neg
"Hi, i love this top. it not only is femine but it is wee bit sexy. it could be worn in the office then out for happy hour",pos
"I just got this after ordering online and i was pleasantly surprised. the cardigan has the structure of a lightweight jacket, so it creates a flattering silhouette. i ordered it in a medium, and even though i'm curvy on top it fits really nicely.",pos
Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.,pos
"This dress is everything i love about retailer. a never-could-have-guessed-it, feminine, textured twist on a classic. it's beautiful, it's comfortable. the cut is true to size (for me) and figure flattering.",pos
"I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right, the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack, which it will because concensus is, it's way too long.",neg
"This dress is everything i hoped it would be: flattering, cute, cozy",pos
"Incredibly flattering and going to be useful for multiple occasions - i needed a 'default' black dress and this is it.

only downside - it's pictured with a beautiful grosgrain ribbon at the waist, but does not actually come with the ribbon. i'll be trying to find something similar at a ribbon/embroidery shop, as the dress would really benefit from a slightly cinched waist.",pos
"This is probably my current favorite dress. it is beautiful, comfortable, and flattering. i wear it with swept up hair and delicate earnings.",pos
"These are my new favorite pair of jeans. very flattering (particularly on the bum)! the wash is great - dark and slightly distressed, with a frayed hem at the ankle. the leg is straight rather than super skinny, which i am really enjoying as of late. fyi - i am usually a size 29 in denim, but went down to a 28 in this style.",pos
I needed a legging to wear with boots. makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings. try to find warm leggings....almost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue! the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm! perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot.,pos
"These ag stevie ankle jeans only have 50% cotton.tthe rest is 41% lyocell (a rayon), 7% polyester, and 2% polyurethane. result: thin and clingy jeans that show every lump, and stretch out. 
.
these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at 80% cotton, 18% modal, 2% pu. it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with 98% cotton, at least in the stevies.

i'm sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs, b",neg
"I got lots of compliments on this dress as expected. the arm holes are a little large, meaning low. but other than that i love it.",pos
"This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style, but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level, retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh.",neg
"This is a very fitted dress. i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves. there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little. i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry, jacket, even a large sweater over the top. tts. i definitely would not recommend sizing down! i'm a 8/10 and the med is right for me.",pos
I've always been a pilcro fan and they always seem to fit just right. this pair of velvety pants was no different. lightweight velvet and a great cut. yay!,pos
"This romper has a great shape! you know that long saggy grandma butt that some rompers give you....this one is not that! it's cute and adorable and those long stitched pockets are so flattering to us short folk! i'm 5'4"" on a good day, 125#, 32g and this fits great. i picked up an xs (i'm never an xs) and it was very flattering. i'm usually a 4/27 in pants for reference. the v-neck and the way the shoulder seams start to angle in at the top make this very flattering. it is long enough for me to",pos
I actually bought this dress last year and they made another one in a similar dark floral which i also bought--because i love this dress so much! i wish they would make a different pattern--i'd buy a third one! the online picture does not do any justice to this dress. fits like a dream---soooo flattering. modest but not matronly at all. flows beautifully. i have received tons of compliments every single time i wear this dress. this dress is absolutely lovely. please make this in another pattern!,pos
"I love the feel and drape of silk. this dress has lovely drape, and fantastic color. i think if paired with the right sweater and leggings, this will work well into the fall, and also transition into other seasons if you are savvy! the only awkward point about this dress is that you must wear a belt with it if you have an hourglass shape, otherwise it's a beautiful swing fit.",pos
These leggings are so comfortable and luxurious.  when i opened the package i knew i was in trouble.  they are comfortable and beautiful.  a perfect piece for any wardrobe.,pos
This top is easy with nice hem detail.,pos
Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it's an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it.,pos
"Can dress it up or down and still look good in it! i wear leggings under it to keep my legs warm since the material is thin and i live near the ocean. this is my new standard summer dress! i bought an xxs since i am petite weighing 95lbs and stand 5'1""",pos
"Great fit, comfortable and stylish. easy to dress up or down, excellent item for any wardrobe.",pos
I was so stoked about this swim suit.  i bought it for mine and and my husband's anniversary trip.  it didn't disappoint.  it was gorgeous.  amazing quality. fabulous on.  unfortunately in my case though - the bottom is incredibly low cut and showed my c-section scar. so it had to go back :(,pos
Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.,pos
"This tank/blouse is flowy and i love the design. it was immediately comfortable and seemed true to size. i wore it to a family event with a sweater, black leggings and boots. i'm 5'5,"" 36d and usually wear medium in retailer tops and this fit beautifully from the get go, just love it!",pos
"This top is an easy, classy staple for summer -tts and drapes well, great shape",pos
"I have to return this top. the armholes are huge. the material is on the thin side and not what i expected. i can't size down. i got an xxs. maybe if i had been able to order a petite, it would have fit better. i ordered the red and i liked the color.",neg
"This is adorable! the sweater is light-weight and soft. please know that the sweater line falls right at my mid-riff, followed by the fringe, so for me, it's almost cropped. the fringe covers my mid-riff. the back is open and so this sweater will not be super warm in the winter, but it is stylish and cute. i love it! it's different and unique. i purchased xxs in petite. fits a little more cropped than the photo shows.",pos
"As the previous reviewer mentioned, the pockets ruin this dress. pockets, usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress, so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.",neg
I love purchasing these tunic/ruffle dresses because they can be worn anywhere.....this dress is definitely a little on the heavy side for winter wear...the color is beautiful...i am 5'4''. 138 pounds and always purchase a large for a relaxed fit....i plan to wear it out to dinner for my birthday and to a house party on new years day....,pos
"This dress is so different from any you normally see and its gorgeous. the blue on bottom is actually a much brighter blue in person than in the pictures on the site. the dress pleats along every blue line, so when you walk, it's as if the dress changes colors with every movement. it's fully lined so nothing shows underneath and it's just really beautiful. i also like how the back opens, but not all the way down, so you can wear a strapless bra without the back showing. 
but the sizing was a bi",pos
"I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o",neg
"I tried this on in the store and immediately loved it!  it is ""diaphanous,"" but that is the intended look.  the dress is meant to be a cool, breezy, cover-up.  the design would have been slightly improved with slight tapering at the waist and sleeves, but not everyone can carry a fuller dress to begin with.  anyway, i purchased so many things that day that i had to narrow my picks down a bit.  i left this dress behind, but kept thinking about how very pretty it was.  when retailer offered an addit",pos
"I love this top! i debated between an xs and a s, but i'm usually an xs in deletta so that's what i got. it fits perfectly and is beautiful.",pos
"This dress is very pretty. i love it! people are not kidding about the buttons! i was prepared to reinforce them after it arrived. unfortunately, both buttons at the wrists were missing and they were not in the bag. it was on sale so i'm guessing they were lost before shipping. i love the dress enough to keep it. it will not be that big of a deal to replace them. besides the buttons, the dress is a very nice quality. it is lined and has a nice weight to it. i'm obsessed with rifle paper co. so i",pos
"This dress is so pretty and i instantly fell in love with it when i tried it on. i generally wear size 0 or 2 and opted for the 2 for more room. i know some reviewers felt that the dress ran too long at the bottom, but for me, i was sold on it because this dress is form fitting, i like a more conservative look for work. wouldn't want form-fitting and short dress. my favorite kind of dress is form-fitting and falls at or below my knees a little.",pos
"This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that's quite off because i'm only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a",neg
"This dress is really cute and is a lightweight knit that is great for warmer days. the color is a lovely dusty rose that looks just like the picture. since it is a knit material and does tend to stretch out, i did go down one size so that it would be more form fitting. the length on the petite size is perfect for me.",pos
My favorite pants! they do run slightly large so i sized down. i have 3 colors and will continue to add more!,pos
"This is a nice year round weight sweater. 
i am thrilled with small details, true to retailer pieces.",pos
"These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70's vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look, they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!",pos
"I rarely order pants on line...as the size often varies so much. took a chance on these as they were on sale and they are just stink'n adorable! i am so glad i did, i love them. i ordered both colors, haven't got the neutral pair yet but the green plaid fits me like they were made for me!! for reference i am about 5""3' tall, my weight is around 137.5 ish. i ordered the 28 regular, and they fit perfectly. i hope they don't stretch to much when i wear them. if so i will update my review.
i just lo",pos
Got this shirt in the map design - super cute! it looks great with jeans or chinos in different colors. fun and different shirt. fit just as expected.,pos
"I ordered this in the navy and the red/blue plaid. fit- i'm usually a 10 m. after reading reviews, i ordered a l and it was the right choice. it's silky and covers up my postpartum middle nicely. i was worried the pleats would accentuate that part of me, but it does not at all. print- love the plaid. not sure about the navy with diff color dots. that one is probably going back.",pos
Unusual design and striking color make this the perfect dress this winter season. the fit is flattering and the design makes it perfect for work or play.,pos
"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small, thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants, a size 32c bust, and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant, it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr",neg
This dress is comfortable and a great go to dress to wear to work and then after for drinks with friends.,pos
"I love it!!! i can wear out to dinner or just out to lunch with
friends!",pos

"I just got this top in the mail and love love love it! i thought it was on the pricey side for a shirt, but couldn't help but purchase it full price because i love anything pineapple print! the metallic print is cute and chic from day to night. i also love the open shoulders, making this design different and perfect for summer. i'm only sorry that i didn't see this top online until i already returned from my vacation in maui! very comfortable and easy, worth the price!",pos
"This is a precious! it's a little thin, as i prefer a thicker fabric. however, wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!",pos
Love this shirt and the print. i would wear it all the time if socially acceptable. i've only worn it once but have already gotten so many compliments. there are hints of neon in the coloring that can't really be seen in the pictures. i saw it in store and fell in love and then decided to splurge when i saw it online and couldn't think of life without it.,pos
"I bought this on sale in all 3 colors. it doesn't look like much in the photos, but that's really the point. this is a staple, basic piece. layer on colors and prints, like a printed jacket, scarf or bag. i bought this in wine, along with the sweater knit boots and a bag with a print that ties the colors together. the shape of this dress is great - fitted through the waist and not a lot of extra fabric in the skirt. midi is usually a bad length for me 5'2"" but since the skirt isn't overwhelming,",pos
"I noticed this top on one of the sales associates, and it looked great. she's probably 230lbs and about 5'5.  tried it on and it looked horrible, i even tried sizing down twice. i'm 5'8"" and the ruffles started right under my chest. i gave 2 stars bc of the material, it is light, and summery.",neg
"Great for the beachy business look. classy, but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.",pos
"I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didn't fit. it's such a cute summer top, perfect with cropped jeans! i'm a 32b and usually a size small but had to size down. i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and it's super cute. because of this though, i wouldn't pay full price so i'm happy it was on sale!",pos
"I love this sweater!!! i checked runs large, but it's really just a roomy sweater. i bought the small, which is what i usually buy, but it is big enough to wear over long sleeve shirts, etc. it's soft and cozy and i think i wore it 3 days straight when i first got it - one of those pieces that you will wear over and over. wore it with jeans and a blouse, then with palazzos and a tee and then over my workout wear the next day before deciding it was time to give it a rest! love this sweater!!",pos
"I just received this in my normal petite xs and it fits perfectly! it's gorgeous in person, and i know this will be one of my most worn tops this summer.",pos

"I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted, it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however, i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.

"This jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly. i am 5'2"", 102 lbs. and 32c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect. i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but it's not at all and fits like a glove. i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far. easy to throw on when i'm out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night! love!",pos
Love this dress !!,pos
"Great news if you missed out on this tank last year! this s the exact style and cut as last season's buttondown tank released by c&s. 

super flattering fit, not too poofy. it *is* semi-open in the back and the slit goes as high as the last button. super sweet for summer and goes with virtually everything. i reeeeally wish they had this one in more colorways. it's grrrrr8!

"I love this dress. the pattern is fun, the style is relaxed and breezy for spring/summer, and it is well-made. a steal at the sale price! also, it has pockets :) a huge plus for me. since it is a loose-fitting style, i would say it run just a tad big. i bought the s petite and i am 5'4"" 115lbs. i could've gone xs petite ...but the s fits well and looks great. the pattern is stunning. a great addition to my summer wardrobe. i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant, but it hits me right",pos
"This is a great dress! it's comfortable, easy care, and it looks fantastic. i love the bright green color, it's easy to wear alone, casually, or dressed up with cardigans or jackets. for my climate, this is a year-round piece. i can tone down the color and layer for cool seasons, and wear it alone in warm seasons.",pos
"I love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color. i purchased size 10 and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size (36dd) with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well. i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height, so i'm waiting for the petite to arrive to see if it's more flattering. i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty, so you may want to size down if you're slender or pear shaped.",pos
I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.,neg
"I had high hopes for this top but it didn't work for me at all. it shows your bra straps perfectly. plus, it was so big and boxy that it made me look about 10 pounds heavier. no thanks!",neg
Probably the most comfortable jeans i have ever owned. they are more comfortable even than yoga leggings. they look and fit like real jeans while feeling like loungewear. i have nothing negative to say about them.,pos
I tried this skirt on because i liked the green color thinking that the pockets would not be flattering to my size 12 figure. i was wrong. the pockets are flattering to a round tummy. the pocket flap is stitched down on the side and button near the center so they don't stick out. a good skirt for fall.,pos

"When i saw this tunic dress, i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable, true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.",pos
"This dress is stunning and very flattering. i am a few months postpartum with just a bit of belly flub left, and this skims in all the right places without showing that. the fabric is gorgeous, although it seems like the darker colors can be a little sheer (i got the holly). absolutely love this, would consider picking up another color. i do find it runs a little small compared to other dolan pieces, including those in this fabric. i have a tunic and another dress in a small. i got a medium here",pos
"I bought this online to wear in my engagement photos, and its absolutely perfect! i typically wear a size l or xl and could have easily worn the l in this top, runs a tad big. keep in mind it is on the shorter side. i will be purchasing a white tank to wear underneath it.",pos
"This top fits tts. the sweater part is cream, eyelet material is white. love it!",pos
Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!,neg
This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!,pos
"I was very impressed with the fit of this sweater dress. i am a 4p, 5'4"" and the length and general fit of this is perfect. the fabric is so soft. love it!!",pos
"I bought this well made cute top today and love it. it can be day time casual or dressy for dinner. you will want to probably wear a cami underneath since its see through. its perfect for summer! im a 36d, 5'7"" 135 pounds, and usually wear a medium, but the small fit perfectly with room to spare. cuter in person.",pos
This top is so soft i want to wear it every day. the orange is beautiful in person. great fall color. perfect amount of swing.,pos
"I was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store. it has my favorite colors in it. blue and orange. as one reviewer said, the print is eye-catching. the feel of the material is soft. i am 5' tall so it fits on me like a dress, although if you are a taller person, the slits on the side may be higher on the frame. this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now.",pos
"I normally avoid white tops because they usually don't have that pop,but when i saw the 50's styling on it i just had to try it. i came in to buy another top from their catalog but it was such a wow i walked out with it instead.",pos
"I love this jumpsuit. i've worn it twice and received many compliments both times. absolutely gorgeous. i couldn't be happier. 5'5"", 135, 34c-6.",pos
"This dress is comfortable, hugs and skims at all the right places, and sports a perfect length for a shortie like me. wish the other patterns weren't sold out.",pos
Loving this top! the material is lovely and high quality plus the design is very flattering on body. perfect for cooler evenings out. did i mention super flattering?,pos
"I'm not sure why this dress has such bad online reviews because i absolutely love it! it fit tts for me, but i have a large bust so will run big if you are smaller on top. i don't like paying full price usually, but the quality and beauty of this dress justified it! if you are into prints and colors, you will definitely be able to pull it off :)",pos
"Tried it on at the local store today, it is very pretty! i believe i runs large. i am usually a small, but they only had an xs and it fit perfectly. it is made of thick linen and has a lining.",pos
Beautiful fall/winter piece! so soft and comfy!! was unsure about it when i saw it online but once i saw it in store and got to try it on and feel it i could not put it down! i felt you could definitely size down!,pos
"This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms, and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why, retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day, classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.

now i have a problem",pos
"This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees.",pos
"Great length, very comfortable, very pretty. perfect dressy winter skirt!",pos
"This was sold out in an xs when i first saw the email. i ended up seeing in my local retailer store and tried on my usual xs. i am 5'3"" with a longer torso and about 108 pounds. my chest size is 32c and the xs was just too tight. it buttoned up beautifully and the length was as it is on the model, even though i am much shorter. however, when i tried to move my arms, the jacket constricted all movement. this is a huge disappointment and i imagine going to be an issue for many girls who order online",pos
"These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral, and wore with a black peasant top, sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though, so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model, and after a few hours they were hanging off of me, so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.",pos
"This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it's form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs,",pos
"The skirt is a little longer than i expected, it hits me at my calf, i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely, very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic",pos
"The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.

very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!",pos
"The pictures don't do this justice. it's so beautiful on. drapes incredibly. the cream color is a warm, creamy bright off white. looks really nice. incredibly comfortable. i could see this being an excellent item to wear on planes. super cozy and chic. a must have.",pos
"I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight, the romper fit perfectly! it's a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it's stunning!",pos
"I'm seriously in awe of this fun dress! the beading, fuzzy flowers and embroidery on the peachy dress make me very happy. it's nice to wear by itself with a simple necklace but i love it more with my cropped jackets--my dark denim for a casual air or the tailored tuxedo black for date night! like others have said, this dress has many layers and is surprisingly heavy. definitely not for hot humid weather or i'd melt and cry. 


thank you so much to the reviewer who advised sizing up for the ar",pos
"I wore this for a few hours, and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades. the fabric is so fine that during the normal goings-about of my day it gave way. and no, i didn't buy too small, and the fabric didn't pull while i was driving or reaching for anything.",neg
"This is a great basic t that works with shorts, pants, or a skirt.",pos
"I was hesitant about this one since i've tried cloth & stone shirts in-store and found them to be tight in the shoulders and arms. i have athletic shoulders and arms, so i didn't have high hopes for this one. i tried it on in-store and it's surprisingly true to size. i always wear m in tops and this fits perfectly. it is long, but i like that there's enough length that i can tuck it in. for reference i'm 5'3"", 130 lbs, a cup, 17"" across the shoulders.",pos
"I haven't gotten a dress from retailer in a long time that i like as i do this one! this is the old retailer-quality, extras, and unique design! fits like it was made for me-tts, i am 5'5"", 142 lbs and the 6 is perfection! no enlarged arm holes or funky fit...it has lining as well as a tu-tu slip underneath so you can create your own fullness in the skirt. it is very fitted at the bust and waist and will hide numerous flaws at the hips. this dress is spectacular so don't wait...press the button!!!!",pos
"After reading many of the reviews stating the dress can have the potato sack look, i certainly had concerns. particularly since i am petite, hourglass, athletic, and approaching 50. i decided t give the blue shade a try. the lighter shade is beautiful but was afraid it would wash me out with my darker hair and olive-toned skin. let me start by saying the blue is so beautiful and rich looking. the velvet has such dimension and is no ordinary velvet material. it is also lined. when i first tried i",pos
"I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model, and i'm pretty small on top.

overall, nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site",pos
"These were fabulous and a great color in person - true to a normal ag fit. i am 5'1"" and the regular size was too long so i am exchanging them for the petite version in the same size. really hoping they fit the same as the regular version!",pos
"The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it. but, it was awful. i am 5'9'' and the length was fine. the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am. it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like.",neg
As beautiful as in the picture. couldn't go wrong with it. excellent quality and gorgeous color.,pos
"I saw this in the store and grabbed it to try on due to the material and the back. i was surprised how nice it felt on and how the back looked. i had a blue bra on and it really could not be seen which was a worry. i loved how the back lay and that it was shorter in the front. even for the sale price it was expensive, but i went home with it!! it will go great with long skirts, jeans, and any color pants. i was very happy to walk out of the store with it. i am 5'4"" and about 120. i have a slende",pos
The print and fit of this dress is perfect! it's very flattering and slimming.,pos
This is my new favorite dress!,pos
This dress overwhelmed me. i'm 5 feet tall and the print and material just took over.,neg

"I don't know what took me so long to pull the trigger on this item...probably because it wasn't in my store for very long so i didn't try it on in person. i decided to order this based upon the reviews, and i was immediately obsessed. this cardigan is magical. i first wore it to work with black trousers and a plain crewneck t-shirt underneath with a bib necklace, and everybody in my office thought i was wearing the cutest blazer. i had all the ladies come feel it to prove it in fact feels like a",pos
"I bought two, one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also, after one wear, the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on",neg
"Casual comfort with style! fabric is a dream to wear and it flows nicely. not exactly form-fitting, but still flattering. i'm 5'9, 140, and wore the medium.",pos
"I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7"", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos.",pos
"Non-stop compliments! i wear this with dresses at the office, and denim on the weekends- super versatile.  this is one of those pieces that you keep forever.",pos
"Being 5 ft, long/maxi dresses are usually not what i buy, but i tried this dress on and it was the perfect length for me. i wear size 2 or 4 and i tried on both sizes in store. the 4 i tried on had a shorter length for some reason than the 2 (maybe it was a petite and was mislabeled?). i ended up getting the 4 and i love the dress!",pos
"These pants are adorable. i am a petite lady with a small waist and have a hard time finding pants that fit and look good, but these do. they are both cute and elegant. and they have pockets. i have had many compliments. the one drawback is they need dry cleaning.",pos
"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater.",pos
"Absolutely lovely dress, in a gorgeous color, drapes well. the perfect blend of pretty and sexy. so much more beautiful in person!",pos
"I purchased this in the ivory color and love it. very comfortable and agree with reviewer who said it looks good with 1 button or 2 buttoned up. my one complaint is that i found it to be such an open weave that i feel it necessary to wear a cami underneath, which is not the end of the world. the other issue i have: the back is definitely longer than the front, as pictured. i'm not sure why retailer feels compelled to have almost every top they sell have this styling, i don't think its necessary an",pos
"Fits well (true to size), very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!",pos
"I've been stalking this beauty since it came out and when i saw it went on sale with an extra percent off code i knew i had to purchase. well worth the price i paid, a bit steep at full price. 

i went with a size medium- i usually take a small/2-4 in retailer tops and these days i'm around a 32c. i'm also tall with long arms. the design is very forgiving with the cropped sleeve and non-closing front so you have some wiggle room. it fits me like it was custom made. 

the material is a lightwei",pos
"You can?t go wrong with this one. it?s is super flattering. the size medium fit perfectly. for reference, i have a 38in chest (32 ff) and in the medium i was not over exposed, and it can be worn with a racing back bra with it not showing. i wish it came i more colors. please retailer?make this one in more colors.",pos
"Good job retailer for getting the color representation spot on! the blue is so vibrant and the cashmere knit is so soft and comfortable. the dress is oversized but a little too much so. i recommend sizing down to get that ideal slouchy drape, otherwise you may overwhelm your frame with too much fabric.",pos
This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.,neg
"I think when this is new, it runs big, and then shrinks to the right size. that's what it did for me anyway. it did shrink after one wash, but not significantly. i bought it in m and feel it stayed within that range. super cute with shorts - airy, light. love the white. ordering another color!",pos
"I bought two pair in one week...crazy right? i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i bought the pink color, soft faded pink, which drew me to them right away...kinda soft and romantic pink. then two days later went back (one hour drive) and bought the silver which is really a worn in green color. i feel these are true to size, i wouldn't size down because these are""t super stretchy....feels like it also won't bag out during the day. i really love these cords....and the rolled up cuff is adorable.",pos
"I haven't worn a pair of levis in ages, and had forgotten how great they are. i have recently lost weight and i have to say they are very flattering. i wasn't sure at first how i would ilike the frayed hems, but they are growing on me.",pos
I bought this dress as a surprise for my daughter. she was very happy with it.,pos
Like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer. the lining however is not silk it's rayon and sat weird on me. it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless (i do have a large bust). i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will i'm keeping the dress. the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture.,pos
"I saw this online and went to the store yesterday to find it. i tried on a m, which is my normal size, and a s, which, if clothes are baggy, i'll buy for a more fitted look. the s was too small in the shoulders and my arm movement was restricted, so i bought the m. this is definitely true to size. it has a blousy waist to it, so no amount of downsizing will make this a fitted jacket. notice the model is pushing the jacket down with her hands in the pockets to make it look like it has a more defi",pos
I love wearing this dress and have had many compliments. it's a great color and a fabulous fit,pos

"I love this sweater. i bought it in navy at this sale price and now plan on ordering it in the cream color. it runs a tad large and it might even stretch just a teensy bit (but not a lot), however i adore sweaters to be a little too big so this is perfect for me. whenever i wear this sweater i get huge compliments, to the end that the friends wants to go online and order it for herself. tkhe only problem with the sweater is that i love it so much, i want to wear it every single day (which is why",pos
I really liked this dress. i agree with the others that say the side seam comes up pretty high. i think i'd wear as a tunic or open like the model. i can't justify full price though. tts. my normal med fit.,pos
"I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3, 32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person.",pos
I adore this sweater....  so happy that i was able to get one.  get random compliments from strangers all the time!,pos

"I love these pants so much, i have them in two colors. they are super comfy, light and actually really chic. perfect cool girl pants. i have got so many compliments. my young students (4-5) love my ""ninja pants""! i got them on sale. great, great buy. i highly recommend them.",pos
This jacket is sweet and swingy and showing an early sixties vibe that i adore. a bit cropped and wide so definitely size down so your proportions don't look off. i took my medium and it was way too wide and unflattering so i switched to a sp. looks and feels great with layers.,pos
Love this so much. it's beautiful and i get tons of compliments. it's a touch short as a dress but looks amazing with leggings!,pos
"These pants are a great addition to my work wardrobe. i needed to size up more so for my legs vs my waist, but nothing a little tailoring won't fix.",pos
"I bought this dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner. it's beautiful. the material is thicker than i imagined, not a bad thing at all. i ironed it with lots of steam and it came out great. the tie in back is nice because it can be cinched tight or worn more loosely",pos
"I bought this dress in the red option. was a little concerned when i read other reviews that said it looked like a maternity dress, but it didn't look like that on me at all. it falls nicely and fits me well - i am 5 ft, 107 lbs - in size xs. love the details at the neckline and hem. will be looking out for other dresses by maeve!",pos

"These are such a great fall staple. the silver color is the perfect grey-olive, and the texture is perfect. doesn't feel like there is extra material like most cords, and they hold their shape throughout the day. the fit is just perfect, i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly.",pos

Comfortable and true to size. it fits more fitted on the top and very swingy/flowy on the bottom. i got a petite and the length was perfect. if you like to wear very high heels you may want to go with a regular as its a tad short.,pos

"These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.

they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.

So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.,pos
I love these pants. they are really comfortable without sacrificing style. perfect for the office or just running around. i'm 5ft 9inches and 165 lbs. i bought the medium which fits perfectly.,pos
This is one of my favorite tops i've ordered. flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck. i get compliments every time i wear it.,pos

this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus, i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days.",pos
"I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue. both are lovely. i would say that the size runs a bit large, i bought size 12 and the bodice hangs away from my back, arms fit well though, loose fit. hangs well. the lace is nice and stiff. the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained. i don't think that will be how it reads, though, but fair warning.",pos
"The details on this blouse - lace inset in front and sheer back - look just as great in person as they do in the photos. the fabric is wonderful too; the knit has enough heft that it doesn't show every body imperfection or detail in your bra. it held up well through its first wash and ironing as well. as others have noted, the style is versatile - easy to wear with a cardigan or blazer at work or to pair with skinny jeans or shorts on the weekend. i was also positively impressed by the color sin",pos

"As others have mentioned, they're quite long. i'm 5'8"" and need to wear 2"" heels to make sure these don't drag. they're much tighter in the butt and thighs than my other pilco pants. i love the button detail at the ankles.",pos
"I ordered the cream colored duster after purchasing the grey one in store. i loved the grey one so much i had to get the other color. i love the length of the item. i am 5'9"" and don't feel like it is too short for me to get the look. it is light weight so i did not get too warm in it and will be able to wear it much of the year. i did wear it open as i feel that it runs a tad tight on the arms and torso when buttoned. however, i prefer the look of it worn open so that was not a problem for me.",pos
Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.,pos
"I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however, it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.",neg
What a great light dress for spring and summer evenings. i love the length and the laid back style. this dress is true to size.,pos
"This top is great to wear under a blazer when cool or alone on a warm day. i rated it as runs small only because if you are a little busty as i am, it is a little snug across the chest. otherwise fits great.",pos
"I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size, and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!",pos
"I love this dress. i live in maxi dresses versus shorts in the summer and this is the perfect cut, weight and quality. i did have to order it in petite or else i was stepping on the bottom (unless really high heels). i am 5'5"", so i would say that it runs long. offer this cut in more colors!!",pos
"I ordered this dress in a size 6. for reference i am 5'7"", 145 lbs. i love it! the fit is perfect. unlike other reviews, i was aware the hem was unfinished, and i like the look. the top part does not seem to short. the style, to me is kinda retro. i wore the dress with flip-flops and a large chunky necklace. i received lot's of compliments, it is my favorite dress right now!",pos
This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.,pos

Adorable with black pants or jeans. covers the part of your arm you might want covered :-),pos
"I was so excited about this top, as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way. unfortunately, this top feels like an old grandma's polyester suit, the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer. it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way, due to the layered fabric. 

sadly, going back.",neg
"Although i wish this was not so dark blue for summer, it is the most fabulous cut, super sexy with the tie neckline and love the side pockets... and did i mention the fabric is ridiculously soft? i just wish it was more of a blue denim blue but nonetheless, i could not walk away from the store without this. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and medium fit me perfect for length in the leg.",pos
Love this tank! so easy to throw on quickly and still look out together!,pos
"I am always on the hunt for a cute white t-shirt but this one was a miss. it is too boxy (short) and the material is very thin for the price. i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for spring/summer. for reference, i am 5'4 and 115 lbs and i ordered a small. bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store.",neg
"I picked these off of the rack at retailer, mainly because i loved the navy, black and brown combo of the squares. i tried on the medium, because they looked on the small side, even though i usually wear a size 4, or small in pants. good thing too, these fit really well,so they do run small, albeit a bit long in the regular medium on my 5'3"" frame. i could have used a petite for length if they had been there, but they didn't. that's ok, i don't mind rolling them up, it makes a statement i like. ye",pos
"I went into retailer looking for a specific dress and had to try this on when i saw how lovely it looked displayed at the store. it is a beautiful dress. not see through at all. substantial weight, not to heavy and so very beautiful. i stayed tts on it . i would have purchased it but was buying 3 other dresses.. i may go back as it will be perfect for the hot summer days.",pos
"This coat won't take me through a cold boston winter, but i will be willing to sacrifice a little warmth in order to take this beauty out for a night on the town. it's chic, slim, elongating and bold. it looks fantastic paired with some bold tall boots and solid colors underneath. as for sizing, i tend to disagree with most ""runs small"" reviews, but this baby runs small. especially if you really do live in a cold climate and intend to wear something substantial underneath. my bust measurement is",pos
"When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit.",pos
"I am not a model shape but this dress looked so light and beautiful i had to try it. it wasn't available in my local store so i risked it and ordered online. i'm 5'6"" and about 175 lbs; the medium fits perfectly. i will say that the skirt fabric comes much more sharply pleated than it looks in the photos, maybe this hangs out/mellows over time. the lining to the knee is going to be great for warm summer days. can wear to work with a shrug and some flats or to a summer wedding. the pattern is bea",pos
I just discovered this dress a few days ago and it's simply dreamy!! i'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops. this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest. the lace cut-outs are gorgeous!,pos
"I purchased this in the green. nice print, not overwhelming. slips on, hides a bra, and was simply comfortable to wear. can easily be dressed up or down, but i was looking for a dress that i could slip on at the last minute to go out to dinner with friends. i took it on a trip to florida, and it did not wrinkle in my suitcase. what more can you ask for?",pos
"I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time.",pos
"I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee, it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet",neg
I disagree with the fit description from the other reviews. i find the shirt to be super flattering and comfy. yes it it short in comparison to many styles these days. but it hits right at the waistline without being too short. super vibrant colors.,pos
"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo",neg
"Love this top the crossover design is so cute. i ordered by normal xs (5'5"" 110 lbs) and was worried it wouldn't fit right in the chest (34 d) but it does and even though it's cut on the lower side it's made so there is no gap in the shirt when you bend over. has a little elastic in there to keep everything together. perfect length and nice thicker material got the navy and red stripe and with white jeans is so cute!",pos
"Perfect for work or going out. i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate. it did not feel scratchy to me, maybe because i layered it. great buy especially with the discounts. feel like i lucked out.",pos
I just got this sweater and it really is a great fall weight. i disagree with other reviewers that it is oversized and that the sleeves are long. i found the sleeves to be just right and it to fit normally. i almost wish i got a medium just so it would be a little baggier and the sleeves would be a little longer. i got the green and am really happy with the color.,pos
"I just bought this top in size medium and i love it. super comfortable and flowy. if you want to dry it in the machine, just put cold air and it won't shrink. don't use hot air...",pos
"I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isn't for me. the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable. the fit is not quite right on me. the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt. i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not. it was not very comfortable for me either, so this was clearly not a win for me.",neg
"These are a different take on the white jean. thick enough that you don't see undies. cool lace detail on the ankles. i have very long legs, so they hit me a little higher than described. i did undo the laces a bit to give them a little kick at the bottom. i love the fit of the plico jean. i own a few pairs and they sit just high enough on my waist so when you bend over your bottom doesn't peek out. i usually wear a 27, and they aren't too tight and have a bit of stretch, but don't loose their s",pos
White and silver threads made fabric look grey. almost dirty. fit was nice and price is great. villa to pool to restaurant would be great. colored fabric would be better.,neg

"Wonderful shirt, soft and flattering... usually wear a medium, but got the large to layer over tanks and leggings. could have easily worn a medium, but large is not frumpy at all",pos
"I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.",neg
This one didn't work for me. ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein. riverdeck was cute and flattering cut. this one was boxy on me and didn't work. a bit too wide so sending back.,neg
"These t-shirts by pure + good are buttery soft and so flattering. they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee. i have 2 from last year, machine washed many many times (on delicate cycle) and they still look almost new. i was hoping to pick up a couple more but they're gone! please retailer, bring these tees back!! i would kill for that beautiful dark blue...",pos
I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasn't so flattering on. such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee!,neg
"I love the ease of this dress. the style can be dressed up or down. the straps are inset a little which doesn't work for every body type. the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet. the length is just right, not too long like some other maxi dresses. the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well. the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra. i am normally a 4 or 6 in dresses. the waistband hits",pos
"I look like i put a baggy bag over my head. also, the material really seemed like fake velvet to me.",neg
"High quality, soft, thick fabric that drapes well, keeps you warm, and figure flattering. i'm 5'4 and the length is perfect. the color is a great neutral that goes well with everything. love the design detail throughout. this cardigan does not have a button or tie closure so if you are between sizes, go with the smaller size for a tailored fit.",pos
"Very well made and comfortable with nice finishing touches and fabric. looking forward to wearing it many different ways either with jeans, pants or long dresses. i'm 5'1 and petite sizes were out of stock so i chose small regular which looks great, not too long so i won't have to shorten.",pos
"Love this top for casual days. fits perfectly, fabric feels quality and color is bright but not too bright. good length, just touches top of my thighs.",pos
"Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6""). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)",pos
"At 5'3"" and 155 pounds with a short waist, it's hard to find attractive jeans. hit the jackpot with these. they're comfortable, very slimming with a perfect rise and length. i ordered size 32 so i did go up a size. love the button closure instead of a zipper. these are much better than my citizen boyfriends that cost twice as much. try these, you won't be disappointed!",pos
I never write reviews and i do a ton of online shopping but i had to write how amazing this dress is. so happy with this purchase. totally worth every penny! it fits like a dream- the rouching on the side is so pretty and i love the full coverage at the top. such he pretty colors too. perfect dress!!!,pos
"I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).",neg
"I tried on the grey motif yesterday, and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved, and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs, and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms, so i generally wear a small, but i tried on the small, and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath, so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath, go with your usual size.",pos
"I purchased this for a recent trip with my friends and thought it was worth the price. the swimsuit is comfortable, yet flattering and all the patterns are really unique. i received a lot of compliments about the swimsuit! the one downside was that the fabric hook for one of the straps broke so i had to sew it back on. other than that, this was a great purchase! i recommend this to anyone who wants a very whimsical, but comfy swimsuit!",pos
I just bought these shorts in the gold color. the fit is just right and the material / quality matches up to the price you pay. totally worth every penny.,pos
Perfect summer dress! this is a must buy! it can be dressed up or down,pos
The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul,neg

this dress fits well on top for my broad shoulders, chest(40c)and through my straight hips. note. the side bottom panels are very stretchy. i will have it tailored slimmer. so if you are bottom curvy, this dress is awesome!",pos
"Very flattering suit. runs large. i stumbled into this in my local store. must have been a return. i tried it on even though it was a size small not my usual medium. fit like a glove!! covered my 36c chest. i have tried many suits and this is best on my curvy shape. flattering to tummy. i am 5'6"" 127lb.  not very toned at 59 years of age. this suit is amazing. highly recommend!!!!",pos
"I bought the white and olive today. i usually get a size s, but opted for the xs for this shirt. i am longer torsoed than perhaps average, so it came to just below mid-butt, which i like. my shoulders are on the broader side and a bit muscular, but even still the xs was perfect and cute, rather than just comfy. def an undershirt is needed for these, but i run cold, so i nearly always have an undershirt. the fabric is just nice enough that i could wear the shirt with a fun, nice skirt with a high",pos
"I'm in love with this skirt! i already have so many outfits planned out! i do feel it runs slight large, maybe half a size?? i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and usually wear a 6. i ordered a small, and it's fairly loose, but i like that personally. if you want a tighter pencil look, then size down.",pos
"This top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color. i wasn't too sure i'd like the cut on the bottom, but the neckline was so lovely i thought i'd try it out. i went with a small which is my usual (if not extra small) and loved it as soon as i put it on. the shape is very flattering, even with my post baby figure. i definitely think that it's better in person than in the photos online. and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater that's both classic and mode",pos
"This says online only, hwoever the balc one was in my store (and some other colros too). anyway, i actually liked this top, it is more flattering than the model shows, i think i could wear this with pants or legginss in botos. on me, the regualr size is almost a dress (should i be younger), but i do like that (i did debate ordering petite, and decided not to). it is thin enough to not be too hot indoors, and sublte stripes on the black version.

"I purchased the violet chino's in my local store. the color to me is more plum than violet but a nice shade still. the fit was perfect and they are oh so comfortable. i bought size 27 (weight fluxes 116-118). i can see having several pairs of these in other colors because of the comfort level and they work for fall, spring and summer. in the warmer states even winter. the fabric has a soft feel to it.",pos
"I ordered this on a whim, not sure what to expect. i'm petite (5'1, 110) and ordered a small petite. i usually wear xs-s in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs. it fits beautifully and is very cozy too. the collar is gorgeous and very soft. i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe.",pos
"I ordered these in a xxs, a little nervous about them being too small, and i was very pleased with the fit. for reference, i'm 5'2, 98lbs. these are great for all seasons, the lining is warm, yet adds a pop of color when cuffed. the crowns on the birds are pretty nifty!",pos
"The structure makes this fit perfectly. the details are also lovely, and it is soft and well-made. it is a little sheer, but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath. if you are between sizes, i would probably size up.",pos
"This cute dress has a built in slip, so no need for a slip . i think it has a flattering fit and the colors are pretty!
i feel like i could wear this dress to a shower, out to dinner, or just for a fun look to shop on a nice day!",pos
I tried this on today and loved it. it is so well made and stays down off the shoulders without any struggle. it is lined in the front and the back is billowy and gorgeous. a timeless and well made piece.,pos
This top looks even better in person! the fit is very flattering and the fabric is comfortable. i highly recommend it!,pos
"This dress is soft and comfortable. it's perfect for summer. i ordered my usual size 4 petite and it fits perfectly. 34"" 26"" 5'1""",pos
"I got this dress in the gray, size small and it fits me perfectly. it hides flaws in your figure and is nice enough that it can be worn to the office and then out later for a date or dinner. i did not try on the white/black combo because i thought the white top part might be too sheer. unlike other reviewers, i think the contrast of fabrics works. i'm not sure why there are negative reviews here, i must have the right body type for it because i love it!",pos
I live in a hot and humid climate so this tank is perfect for everyday use. you can dress it up or down and the lightweight material keeps you cool. i bought it in 2 colors and may go back for more. i wish i would have found them sooner.,pos
"I was looking for something for a spring wedding that wasn't too billowy, but not overly fitted either as i try to hide leftover postpartum pounds. this offered the perfect solution with the slip underneath the looser netted overlay (i got the black). the overlay is not delicate, but not stiff either - just good quality that falls beautifully. so happy with this dress - comfortable, attractive, unique...and versatile! can easily see wearing this to work as well as a wedding :)",pos
"It is delightful, dreamy and yes it is quite right. perfect fit, i wear a size 8 and it was right on!!!",pos
"I saw the cream top online and loved it, but it is even prettier in person. i typically purchase petite sizes online, but i tried on the 0 in the store and it fit nicely-- not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned, but the length was just right and the arms/chest fit perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'2"", 100 lbs, 32b. this will look great with skinny pants or jeans.",pos
This boiled wool jacket is warm and cozy. it does run a little big. i have to fold the sleeves twice! but it looks great and i got compliments immediately.,pos

"I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.

as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.

my only complaint: it came really wrinkled and will definitely not make a travel dress.",pos
"I so wanted to love this sweatshirt. it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material. the pattern is pretty, and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it. unfortunately, the body of the sweatshirt (particularly the front torso area) was too big, and it popped out around me like a balloon. the arms fit well, so i don't think that i could have gone down a size. i was also not keen on the way the neck hung, which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded",neg

Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.,pos
They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.,pos

Huge! normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering.,neg

I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.,pos

"The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester. 

also, this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.

"I typically wear a size 16/xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl. it's more of a t-shirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge. it's nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l, this would have looked like a maternity top on me.",neg

"This is a beautiful top. i purchased this in the green/moss color. it's reminds me of a vintage looking blue-green. it fits generously, has more of a swing style to it. i love it! i think it is romantic and feminine. glad i made the purchase. simply beautiful.",pos
"Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick, so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!",pos
"I really like this dress, i wish they still had xxs p as the xs p is still a little big (i guess ti is the style). i love the eyelet design, the high low is very flattering, and the neckline too. very comfortable. i am not sure if i will keep it as i still think the xxs p would be more flattering, but i like it enough to consider keeping the bigger size.

nice with a jeans jacket and brown clogs!

"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good.",pos
"Such a beautiful, well-made dress! the color of the dress is slightly more pink in person -- a very pale pink. the lining is an off-white color. it fits very well, aside from being a bit long (i'm 5' and ordered the xxs petite). so glad paper crown is making xxs p now!",pos
"Got this dress in the blue and cream and it's gorgeous. i love that it's work and date night appropriate, but so comfy. i am 5'4"" but have very short legs, so it's hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that doesn't drag on the ground. this floats beautifully above my ankles - a little lower than on the model, but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels. i got the small and it fits great. the print is lovely - the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some",pos
"I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the",pos

"I love cotton fabric, so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors. i have the dark red/burnt orange color, and it is pretty. but i have worn the thing once, and today when i put it on again, i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt. so disappointed.",neg
"This top has a nice design. i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape. if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist. however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank. it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area, which i could have easily fixed. it is very sheer; even with a nude bra, my bra was too visible for my comfort. plan on wearing a full camisole underneath, tank, or bralette you are fine with being on display.",neg
"A great staple to pull out on chilly mornings. i am 5'9"" so the arm length was perfect",pos
I'm too tall for this. back goes halfway up my back. cannot do much with it other than front tie. fabric is not soft at all. not impressed. returned it.,neg
I've been looking for an off the should sweater like this for over a year! looks great on and doesn't itch! can't wait for fall so i can wear it!,pos
"Lovely top with details and a unique color. i have read some other reviews and i honestly don't know why it is getting bad reviews. it is linen but not scratchy by any means, like linen it does give with wear, so i recommend sizing down as it does run a little large. with a nude bra you won't see your straps and i would dryel this, no washing of any kind, linen shrinks! overall great top and i was glad i snatched one up.",pos
"High quality fabric and lots of bottom/ back coverage. also, it did not cut into my hips (which is fabulous!) ...so, if you're looking for a little more coverage this is your bottom. i found it true to size...i'm 5'8"" and 150 lbs and i got a size 8 :)",pos
"I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota, so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is, the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets, which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me, and i ordere",pos

"I received tons of compliments on this dress. the print is fun and works well with the modest shape. i love the high neckline and the long hem. it's different and cool.
my only complaint: the arm holes fall super low. i didn't realize until i looked at photos but my bra was very visible.",pos

I love the color of this cardigan and the cashmere is very soft. i love the detail in the stitching and how the zipper is covered. i do wish it were a bit longer but it's definitely a keeper.,pos
"I bought all 3 colors and couldn't be happier. love the cut, fabric, and colors. the fabric is light enough to wear in the hot summer of charleston, sc but not so light that you can see thru it. i love flowing tops in the summer that don't stick to you and this cut does that and is flattering as well. i've already work with shorts and a skirt. both looked great. easy to accessorize.",pos
Runs big so size down. i love this top for many reasons but armholes are big so went to xs and i am usually a small or medium. xs was perfect and still long enough for me. gorgeous fabric and color and flow. got tons of compliments! very feminine and comfy. looks great with jeans and white crops.,pos
"Putting my two cents in regarding how fantastic this dress is! i bought the medium petite in navy stripe. it fits great, it's not too clingy and it's flattering to my disproportionate figure (makes me look more hourglass).",pos
"It's lightweight, which is perfect for summer officewear when i don't want bare arms. my fear with buying any white shirt is that it will be too sheer. this shirt is sheer but not as much as most, in part due to the pattern that camouflages any sheer-ness. i don't find it to be see through when wearing a nude colored bra that matches my skintone exactly, i've worn it to work with a nude bra, and it was a great transition shirt between the office and happy hour. i went a size up to a small becaus",pos

"The style, plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4"" thruout the plaid. it's a silver metallic on the blue, & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature",pos
"I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however, they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top, but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily, it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust, and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st",neg
"These pants looked worn, washed & old looking when i received them! the quality is super thin cotton as if it's been washed a million times & is about to fall apart! the workmanship is terrible. you can see loose stitching all over. the top portion is too tight & looks terrible stretched out. i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online...",neg
"I got this piece because it was so unique.. that's one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before, so i ordered it in a 4p, my usual size, and a 4. i am petite, but the 4 worked perfectly, i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.

"If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.",pos
"I had high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately   was disappointed and returned the dress. it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist. it's so odd.",neg
"I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying ""maternity""and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it's not that it runs big it's supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it's a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut, but i lov",pos

Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.,pos
Gorgeous! purchased in red; color is glowing if you have warm complexion/cool undertones.,pos
Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.,pos
"I really like both colors in this top. i love the way it lays, the length, the material, etc. what i don't like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra. this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when it's warm enough to go sleeveless? too bad, i would have bought it for sure.",neg
"I absolutely adore this shirt!!! the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined. i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be, the way it hangs or something..not really sure. nonetheless, it is perfect. can be dressed up or down, which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing! i can tell i'm going to get a lot of wear out of it.",pos
The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!,pos
Just purchased tonight and love i this little jacket.  the embroidery and beading down the sleeves is such an interesting touch yet neutral enough to wear with just about everything this fall.  runs tts.,pos
"Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly, it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything, yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's), but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i",pos

Love it; the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim.,pos
"I definitely agree with the other reviews, however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up, or down, as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6, or 8 (28/29), and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants, so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store, but worth it!",pos
Great jeans. especially if you are on the shorter side (5 ft 3 for example). they run very large. i typically buy size 28/29 and bought a size 27 and had a tailor take in the waist a bit. i'm syked for these for fall!,pos
"Very disappointed when i received this. the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful. beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that. first it is nearly a crop top. second, it is boxy and it's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky. third, need to size down 2 sizes. had to return this.",neg
Tried this lovely navy dress on in the store in a size 6 and it was perfect. wish there had been a petite available to try since the hem fell below the knees on me and it would have to be hemmed. the crisscross on the front is very flattering to the waistline and i love the see through fabric along the shoulders and back. it's stretchy too!,pos

"I'm 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots, but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small, which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me, it makes the sleeves less cartoonish.",pos

These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price,neg
"Maybe it's because i'm 40, but this top was underwhelming. i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big, obnoxious bow on the back. it does look cute on the model, so maybe it's a ""younger"" top. i would have felt silly wearing it.",neg
"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a",pos
"I'm so glad i saw this in the store, as the online photo does not do it justice. it's elegant, detailed, and a beautiful shade of pink. it has a little silver sparkle which makes it perfect for a casual party when you want to opt out of the traditional holiday colors.",pos
"This top could've been one of my favorites ever. i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color. the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear w/o an extra tank. unfortunately after 2 wears, several small holes appeared around the neck/under the ruffle. i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry. when i came to read the reviews, i noticed i wasn't the only customer with this issue.",neg
"This dress is amazing beautiful and perfect for fall. the colors and beading are so much better in person. the pockets are an added bonus! i'm typically a xs but sized up to a s only because i felt the sleeves were tight and across the bust was tighter than i'd like when moving my arms. the xs would have worked but the s is perfect comfort. i highly recommend this beauty. for reference, i'm 5'2, 120 lbs.",pos
"I ordered the green/teal in size xl. the fit on me doesn't match the model. it looks looser on her. i think it runs small, at least in size xl. it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch. the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt. it's a beautiful color of green too. i think the v-neck is too low so i wear a tank underneath. this also helps with the transparent panels at the shoulders/back. my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s",pos
"I'd been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations. well-made, lovely color, very soft, flattering cut. it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s. it's warm and the lining is very pretty. hopefully it'll hold up to daily wear. i'd definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall - spring. i got the plum color.",pos
"This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!",pos
"I got this top in white/rust and it is darling. the lining keeps it from being too see through. the bell sleeves add style without getting in the way thanks to the shorter length. i get many compliments each time i wear it. i am 5'1"", 103 lbs and take xs- fit was true to size.",pos
"This jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif. however, it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store. this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time. it's a big shame, because it's so perfect in every other way. i choose not to buy it. it's very expensive for the quality.",neg
"I love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!",pos
"This top is a great neutral layering piece with some nice visual interest. the black-and-white pattern and tie-neck style will add a little something to a cardigan or blazer. the neck can also be tied multiple ways. it's definitely appropriate for work and i found it tts. i normally wear a 10/m, and took an m in this top.",pos
Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.,pos
"This dress is stunning. i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from. my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it. initially i thought it was supposed to be that way, but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed. it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out, but it is totally worth it.",pos
These pants are so soft and comfortable!! the colors are great too. can't wait to buy more in other colors!,pos
"This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9, a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!",pos
"For reference, i'm currently hovering in the 14 range for pants (called ""curvy"" on the lower half, hahaha), but purchased these in a 12. they are so flattering and comfortable, i returned to purchase a pair to keep stashed for when i wear out a pair and actually bought two pairs in a size 10 for when i loose weight. they look perfectly tailored! the fabric is substantial (more of a spring weight than summer), so you don't have to worry about showing skin beneath the unlined pant, and it drapes e",pos
"This top is very cute. the fit is great and the material is very comfortable. i am a 5'7, 135 lbs and wear a 36d and the medium fit great!",pos
"Wow, i got this top in blue and i'm in love. love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint. i sized a bit down ( usually get a 2) and i got a 0. since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau- tank in the bank, i find it really classy.. like your on-trend but not trying to bare too much skin. i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that. its very upscale looking in the navy. 
would totally buy different colors if it came in others, but i'm no",pos
"I am 5'4"" so at the ""tall"" end of petit - and this is the perfect length. i haven't really done midi dresses before because i feel make me look stout. this is not the case. it hits mid-calf. the fabric is very thick, although for polyester i think it's kind of pricey. i'm going to keep it anyways, it doesn't look or feel cheap, and i think it will be good for travel because i don't think it wrinkles easily. the ribbon hits in a very flattering place right above the waist. i have a very athletic",pos
"I was so excited when i ordered this, i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it, there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something, i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it, not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!",neg
"I have this in the blue/teal color, and i love it, so far! i'm considering buying it in other colors. this tee is stretchy, comfortable, and soft, even after being washed a few times. it fit true to size on me (xs), although it's a bit form-hugging, so if you want a looser fit, consider sizing up. the only thing about the blue is that it's not quite as dark as in the photo on the website. i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often!",pos
"Bought on a whim as a gift for my mom, fit perfectly and she loved the details. did not complain of itching as with prior review. it is more blue than gray appearing the photo.",pos
"The simple shape of this silky & comfortable shift is transported by the fun psychedelic pattern. the fabric is lightweight and drapes very nicely because of the lining. i purchased the size 10 petite to accommodate my 36dd bust/wide rib cage and it fits perfectly. the high neck is fastened with a single hook. versatile and comfortable and a clear winner for spring and summer. for sizing reference my other stats are 5'3"" tall, 140#, m/l on top, s/m on bottom.",pos
"This dress fulfills a gap in my wardrobe that i've long wanted to fill: that of the perfect springtime dress. i got the sky blue color in a size 4 (for reference, i am 120 lbs and 34-26-37) and it fits like a glove. the color is vivid and the overall effect of the dress is simple and romantic. i'll be wearing it with casual cognac sandals, a floppy straw hat, and minimal makeup.",pos
"This is a fun dress to have in your closet! i ordered the 4p, and it was just a little to short for my taste. had the regular 4 sent, and it was perfect! i wore it the very next night to a party... feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves!",pos
"This shirt appears nice in the pictures. it appears to have a bit of style. wrong. the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics i've ever purchased. i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style. this shirt has no style, and i thought it would. i have purchased this brand before, and thought this fabric would be similar. the other shirts were way nicer, softer, and had a different level of construction. i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w",neg
"This skirt is super cute and versatile. dressed up but still pretty casual with a sweater, tights, and boots. i'd say true to size or maybe runs a little on the large side; definitely doesn't run small. love it!",pos
My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.,pos
"The material is horrible, it's heavy and cheap. the skirt does not ""flow"" as it appears in the photo. instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles. am returning.",neg
"You just can't go wrong with a perfect white top. i'm usually xs or s and got this top in xs & the fit is perfect. the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you can't really see in the picture. the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right. thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans, pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants. it can easily be dressed up or down.",pos
"The blue version of this dress originally caught my eye on-line, but wasn't available in the store, so i tried the green one, mainly for size since everyone said it runs a bit small. i did have to size up one or two sizes. i fell in love with the green dress and bought it. it is so comfortable, great quality fabric (not too thin or too heavy). looks great on. i have received several compliments.",pos
"I love this jacket! i was hesitant to order, but i'm so glad i did. it's such a cute, unique blazer to add to my wardrobe. fit is very true to size for a blazer.",pos
"I usually wear a size small in deletta. i am 5'5"" and 140 pounds. the small ran true to size for me. saying that i am a size 8 so usually everywhere else i can take small or medium, so i can see how reviewers say it runs big. love the ruffles on this tank. makes it a little more special. super comfy and easy to wear. will be great for hot summer days in florida!",pos
"I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer. it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large. i loved the feel, color (grey) and style of the dress, but i ended up returning it because of the fit. it also requires something under it since it is fairly see-through.",neg
"So cute and comfy. great fit. i bought them in green and they look great with wedges, sneakers or sandals. dress up or down. pair with a t-shirt and cotton blazer--adorable!",pos
"I didn't expect the fit to be as cute, i am not sure i like how the model is wearing this top, but untucked, or more tucked both look more falttering on. the color is more vibrant in person, still light turquoise, but richer. i don't think i nbeed petite in this as it is blousy, but not oversized or boxy.",pos
"I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy, and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd), so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews",pos
"This skirt is a must have!! it is very classy, and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night. it is high quality and definitely worth the price. i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner, and got a lot of compliments. comfortable and classy.",pos
Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!,pos
Cute embroidered mixed textiled shirt. super comfy maybe runs a little small across chest but has a nice stretch so it accommodates well. a great transition piece.,pos
"This sweet little number in the mustard yellow has become my fall and winter ""go-to"" sweater. so easy to wear, understated and a bit retro. looks great tucked into skirts or high-waisted jeans, or out, and the subtle shift in textures is a nice detail. highly recommend, and a great price point!",pos
Bought this on a whim and am so glad! this is made of the softest fabric and the loose flowing nature of the tank make it perfect over a bathing suit.,pos
"I was so excited to order this sweater. i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days. ordering it on sale made it all the better. however, when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were, with little definition. the sweater itself lacks definition as well, just shapeless and hangy. i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on.",neg
"I was hesitant to buy this dress due to there not being any reviews, but decided to take a chance and order it. it is fabulous!!! great fit, off the shoulder design stays in place, and the dress hits the smallest part of my waist perfectly. the lace detail on the hem and the tassels on the ties are details that sets this dress apart. i wish that it was made in another color, perhaps a solid. you all hit this one out of the park, retailer!!!",pos
"I don't have anything like it in my closet, really excited to wear it",pos
"I love this top. it was cool on a summers day. i did get one of the strings of the design snagged but it worked out just fine, not ruined at all.",pos
"This dress is gorgeous in color and print; i think it can be styled as eclectic or elegant as you'd like. definitely runs big in the shoulder/bodice area, so i sized down.",pos
"I tried this one without a bra, and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.
the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides, so where the seem is on the legs by the wait, didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that, but hard for me not to look at.
also, the length on the model is just below the knee. i usually order petite, but tried on regular size in the store... i liked it like that, the hem went to below the big part of my calf, so it 3was flatte",pos
"I received the pants and they are really nice. you can dress them up or down. i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs, as they were loose. i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites. i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular. the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult.",pos
My favorite new dress. i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric. it's very flattering and easy to wear.,pos
"I ordered the dress on-line. this dress looked pretty, the material was soft and comfortable, the length was perfect, but the zipper was totally out of place. it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn. i had to return the dress. i normally don't see a problem at this level in retailer clothes.",neg
"I received this top in white, last fri., and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesn't cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months.",pos
"Great fit, easy to dress up or down, lovely shade of blue--this will be my default dress this summer.",pos
"The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.",pos
"I tried this on (in the store) on a whim....then had to have it!! i'm normally a small but really loved the way the medium fit. good thing because it was the last jacket like it in the store!! super soft, comfy...a great purchase!! fur is removable for easy washing or a different look!!!",pos
"The floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece.  i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy, but not with this top.  i'm usually wear s/m with retailer brand depending with the design.  this tank has loose bottom section, so the s is tts for me.",pos
"Recently wore this lovely dress during business trip - was stopped four times while walking thru orlando airport. the design is extremely comfortable, the print will make you and others smile. so elegant and fun. the beading on the flowers is elegant. such a unique piece",pos
This jumpsuit is absolutely fabulous. i normally don't wear jumpsuit but i like this one very much. it can be dresse down or dressied up. i really recommend this to everyone any shape who have. very relaxing and beautiful.,pos
Love this sweater so much i purchased the grey and the pink. so far no issues with the stitching.,pos
"I purchased this blouse because i love a 70's vibe in my tops. it is a beautiful, colorful top, but the colors weren't flattering on me. having said that, the cut is nice, the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely, and the fit was fine on me. i am a curvy 5'5"" with a 36 c cup. go for it if this is a style you like. one other note, i wish it had been a bit longer, but i am older and prefer a little more coverage. it's just a personal preference. i think the picture is an accurate depiction.",pos
I love this dress! it's very cute and comfortable. i belted it to give me more of a waistline because otherwise the tented shape overwhelms my short stature. i love the strap design at the neckline. the off the shoulder sleeves are comfortable. i have an xsp which is true to size for me.,pos
"Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor man?s pineapple blouse. i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me (i?m 5?2?), thus i prefer this blouse. i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar. if you wear makeup like i do, you must find a trick to taking it on and off. for me, i put it on prior to putting on makeup (i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup, and don?t even think",pos
This swimsuit is so beautiful and fits wonderfully and is very flattering. comfortable fit as well. love it!,pos
I tried these on in my local store and immediately loved them! they are so flattering on my hourglass shape. the flare leg balances out the hips. great quality and very comfortable. i know i will get so much wear out of these. i bought a size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly.,pos
"Beautiful,delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print, very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers who've mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless, i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out.",pos
Extremely flattering. an easy dress to wear - good choice for both day and evening,pos
"This is my third pair of ag primas - i love them! the higher rise is nice to keep smooth lines, they're made of such soft material that moves with you rather than restricts you, and the cut of the legs is skinny without being skin tight. absolutely my favorites jeans - retailer, sell more washes and i'll buy 'em!! :)",pos
"Sadly, this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour. it snagged on everything -- my watch, my purse, my necklace. i had to go home, change, and return the dress later. impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress.",neg
"I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.",neg
"This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d, and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition, the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately, this top will be going back.",neg
I got this shirt in red and black. both colors vibrant and material of shirt is nice cotton blend. will get lots of use from both shirts.,pos
"I finally tried this on now that it went on sale, and it was surprisingly flattereing. love the blue color, and i assume the purple was equally nice. fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great, long but ok for me,",pos
I tossed this in my bag (online) at the last minute thinking i'd give it a shot. so glad i did. this is dress is so simple and so much more flattering then i expected. you can dress it up or down. i wish it was about 1/2 inch longer but still a good length for me (things are always too short for me). the material could be a little thicker but then i suppose it would lose the bounce that is so key to the flow of thing with this dress.,pos
"What a special skirt. so beautiful, great quality. i got on sale, but still expensive . . and it was still worth it. i will be wearing this for years!",pos
Beautiful and high quality. unfortunately it made me look top-heavy. i am a 36dd .,pos
"I really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on. the arms are so tight! i ordered in a m, which is my normal retailer size, but couldn't move my arms. took it back, was going to try in a l, but store didn't have any. for the price, i need to be able to move my arms!",neg
"It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim, but not tight fit.",pos
"I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is ""the perfect fit"" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear.",pos
I love this flattering and comfortable jacket- it has a nice stretch and the color is out of this world. i think it will pack a big punch this fall.,pos
"This shirt is structured enough to wear to work and flirty enough to wear out on the town. the details around the neck and the bottom make it very unique. i paired it with a chunky necklace and got tons of compliments. however, i could imagine this shirt may not work for those with a bigger bust line as there isn't much give in that area.",pos
"Gorgeous embroidery, soft fabric, great drape, hides tummy--overall perfect.  size down.  i bought the small and i am 36dd.",pos
"Lovely body hugging dress. hits just below the knee. great with boots as shown, or with heels. very soft material and the peppery color is really pretty. i can see myself wearing this to work and out at night. this is a winner!",pos
"These are very pretty, but i have had a few problems with them. out of the package, i found them to be true to size. i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs. however, even though they are machine washable, i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short (i am barely over 5' tall). also, the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing, which drives me crazy. i have to keep straightening it. i think there are better options for sleep pants.",neg
I was so lucky to find these jeans in store yesterday and they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever had. the fit is amazing and wish they weren't sold out online or i would buy more!,pos
7 months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant. went to a dr. apt and the receptionist loved this shirt. i told her it was non-maternity and she can buy it at retailer... i think she stopped by on her way home from work.,pos

"I'm 5'4, 115 and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie. i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if you're 5'8 and above? it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm, body and skirt. a belt was no match for that much fabric. the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made, but the design was awful.",neg
"Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2"" 115 lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!",pos
"Needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored tops.
hei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint.  they fit like a glove and are true to size.  i don't think the picture does them justice.  if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants.  you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer.  i would not hesitate to purchase them.",pos
"I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline, so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale, but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather, though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n",pos
"These are my new favorite leggings. they have everything i need - soft waist band that doesn't squeeze me at all, not overly long, subtle ribbed texture (black pair) that make them feel just a little nicer, and most importantly they are not see thru at all. so soft on the inside too. and this price is nuts too, i'm so happy with these!",pos
I love this dress! i have an hour glass figure and the dress is very flattering on me. i didn't encounter a problem with the colors or pattern as others have stated.,pos

"I love this romper so much! i'm a tall girl (5'9), so often times its hard for me to find a romper that isn't too short. the length on this is perfect. this romper is an adorable design and the fit is great. the material is a great quality, and its really comfortable! i'm 5'9 34b bra, i usually range between an xs and s, i went with the s on this one and it fits great! i definitely recommend this if you're thinking about it.",pos
"I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy. i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beige/cream it represents it better. it made me look very wide. loved it online but it wasn't for me, returned it.",neg

the fabric is wonderfully soft.
i ordered the green, love this color.
will be ordering it in the grey also..
fits very true to size.",pos
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful in person! the metallic thread is a subtle, stunning addition to this elegant piece. like the last person mentioned, it is thick, but i think it makes it look full rather than like a bag. i think the extra fabric/weight adds a more classic/traditional look to it, making it look more like a wool skirt from the 50s, 60s, or 70s. if you're not a fan of that look, you probably won't like the way this falls. like the description says, this is a piece that would neve",pos
"I love this little vest! such an easy outfit completer. just throw it on over jeans and a tank or long sleeves and voila...effortlessly chic! the colors pop and it's the perfect length. if you're on the fence with this one, definitely give it a try. you won't be disappointed!",pos
The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings. or traveling. love this dress. not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress. extremely comfortably and beautiful. i can't recall the last time i bought a new dress.,pos
"Love, love, love. i have both colors and wear with leggings. it's not a heavy sweater and has a great drape, super flattering. i'm usually a medium and it runs true to size - not supposed to be tight. i find it a little low in the front,but a tank underneath takes of it. washes well.",pos
"These corduroys are perfect! the flare is just enough to be current without seeming overly trendy or costumey. they make my legs look super long and look great with a professional top, or my favorite, with a drapery tshirt half tucked.
they are pretty long. i'm 5'5 with pretty long legs and i could use a 1"" hem, which shouldn't affect the style much. until then i'm wearing them with a 1.5 inch platform and they're perfect. highly recommend! if they still had my size in other colors in stock i wo",pos

"I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top. when i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off! it's a little bigger than i would like - i got a small, and am usually between xs and s. may have sized down if the top were available.but the fit and cut are flattering.",pos
"I most often fit into a size medium. based on prior reviews, i ordered this dress in a small and it fits perfectly. it drapes nicely. the fabric is soft and flows well. the under layer has a nice little stretch to it. the dress looks good with and without the belt. my favorite and most-slimming look is to just tie cinch and tie it in the back, such that it does not wrap around the front at all. the dress is so comfortable and the neckline is very flattering. no bra needed for my small bust.",pos
"Just bought this in the store a couple days ago and wore it for the first time today. love the embroidery detail and i feel that the colors are more vibrant in person. i typically wear a 2 in most retailer tops but i got a 0 in this and it is great - seems to be a generous fit. the slits on the sides do come up a bit high, but i wore a cami underneath since it is sheer and the slits were not an issue with it. looks great with jeans. it is a great transitional piece for the fall as i'm sure i will",pos
"This is one of those rare garments that is actually as flattering on me as it looks on the model. just like the picture, it hangs like a dress and emphasizes my curves without seeming too revealing. the weight of the fabric creates graceful movement, while the loose cut keeps it cool and breezy. for reference, i am 5'4"" and curvy (34d, 35x28x39), and i ordered a small petite. this is a smaller size than i would wear in most styles, but it fits almost like it was made for me. the tie hits slightl",pos

"I loved this dressy ruffle sweatshirt. i am long waisted and these often look too short on me but this one fit perfect and actually accentuated my curves in a good way as opposed to making me look ""puffy!""",pos
Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!,pos
"These joggers are so comfortable. nice and lightweight and fabric is very soft and a bit stretchy, so they move with you. beautiful dark navy/indigo print, very subtle and blends well with many tops. perfect length (i am 5'3"", 116 lb. and purchased xs). love them!",pos
Great piece. using as a night gown. slept in it last night. like a dream.,pos
"Not as cute as photos, and too small in chest. i am 5'5'', 125 lbs, and the small was too tight in the chest, and i am not large here at all. shoulders and sleeve length fit well. will return. not comfortable, and will need to be able to button it on rainy days.",neg
"At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.

but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.",pos
Someone recommended to size up if u have large breast and i am glad i did! it fits like a dream! this is the cutest dot dress i have ever tried.,pos
True to size and love the color. great to wear dressed up with wedges and a blouse or dressed down with some mephistos and a tee. linen fabric makes them light for summer heat,pos
This top is true to size and fits perfectly.  color is very natural.,pos

"Living in a warm climate, i'm always on the hunt for great spring/summer dresses that can be worn to work, dinner, or just general out and about.
this dress is a great length with the varied hemline that gives you enough length for work or dinner. it's also great for a summer cocktail party or afternoon out shopping. i'm a traditional hourglass figure, larger on top and bottom with a small waist, dress size 6 or 8 depending on the top. i roared this in a medium and it's perfectly comfy and hang",pos
This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didn't look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.,pos
"Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesn't feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus, i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) i'll be so pretty!",pos
"I love this top! it's so hard for me to find conservative, comfortable and yet not mom-isn swimsuits. this top is amazing. it's comfortable and soft and great quality. i'm excited to use this suit this season!",pos
"I bought this for our daughter. i tried it on when it arrived and the material is fabulous and feels soooo good against the skin. the purple is a stunning color - very subdued and classy. if she does not like it on christmas after gifts are opened, guess who is going to keep it for herself! if she loves it as much as i think she will, then i'll just have to get one for myself. the pleats in the back are very flattering. best of all is the fabric. it is luxurious. thank you retailer for yet another",pos
"I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black (i originally got the lavender color). it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it (though i washed it on a regular cycle and it's holding up well!). as you can see from the photos, because of the wrap style, the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt. i've worn this top with regular rise jeans and haven't had a problem, though if you lift your arms, your belly may show. i purchased my usual size small",pos
"This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back",neg
They are really cute. the fabric is a little stiff but the details are nice. the waist seems big so i suggest sizing down. i bought 27 p my usual size and sent them back for a 26 p because the waist was big.,pos
"Finally a top that fits true to size, is comfortable, and is the quality i expect when shopping at retailer. i cannot recommend this top more! if it came in other color motifs i would buy them too. perfect fall transition top.",pos
"I had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it. i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on, it is really flattering. i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis. it is really comfortable, and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds. i get compliments on it all the time. i also like the slit a lot.",pos
"It's pretty, floaty, feminine; the photos don't do justice to the prettiness. but the photos also don't show an asymmetrical hem. i understood it runs small so i got two sizes, to be safe, and even my larger size was strangely short-waisted, and i'm short-waisted to start with. maybe i could've lived with that, but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any i've ever worn or seen before. it's not longer on just the sides; the hem is longer in one spot on the front, and one in the",neg
"This dress is lovely and the fabric is sensational.

the slits on the two sides of center front are really cool too.

i am 5'7 and it was way too long and i would not have it hemmed at it would remove the gorgeous
lotus pattern near the base of the skirt. i only wear flats at 70 but hope this fabric appears somewhere else
sometime. it is truly a gorgeous dress for a taller person.",pos
I love this shirt. the colors are just as depicted. the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering. fits true to size for retailer small (i'm normally a medium outside of this store).,pos
"These are the perfect way to battle the california heat in style- more beautiful than on the picture. you can't see, but there are gold threads running through the fabric. pair with a sandal and a flow top, and i'm good to go!",pos
"Pilcro from retailer is a great alternative to the premium denim lines with a way better price point! similar cut & quality with awesome rises and spandex/stretch content! also, the styles are always on trend!",pos
On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.,neg
"Dress is wonderfully made. the fabric is soft and the print is beautiful.wonderful detail,especially the ties.  nice lining...not see thru at all.
mid calf length looks good with heels or flats.
lovely dress for a sunny day or an evening out!!",pos
"I am normally not a vest person, however i saw this and had to try it. it is awesome and on sale. i am 5' 3"" and 128 pounds and the small fit perfectly.",pos
"I love this sweater. the pale pink color is gorgeous. i ordered a large because i have broad shoulders, and it fits perfectly. it's a great sweater for any season. love the slits on the sides and the longer back. i would order more if it came in white or black. love it!",pos
This dress drapes very well and is flattering to many different body shapes. the colors give it the flexibility to wear from summer into fall. gorgeously designed!,pos
"I saw this dress in the new arrivals in red, and it caught my attention, but not enough to order it (the pictures online for other colors didn't look that great). well, i saw the black in the store and decided to try it on as it looked like hte cut would be cute. it fit like a glove and i actually love the pattern. i ordred the peite to compare, and also the red to see in person... we shall see which is the winnrer!",pos
"I've been looking for sometime for a spring/summer jacket to wear on warm days over light clothing. i wanted something feminine and just structured enough to move beyond casual. this fits the ticket! it is a very pale grey and a soft, cozy fabric. i am 5'8"" tall and 118 lbs, and usually wear an xs in many items but a s in jackets due to the shoulders. these shoulders were large on me in the s. the waist was also large, but worth having it altered. if you find this on sale it's a great buy!",pos
Gorgeous fabric. love the crochet back of top & cut out sides of bottoms. runs small. i'm 34a - small top fit. 26-36 - medium bottoms fit.,pos
"I love this poncho!! it's perfect for chilling saturday mornings at the soccer field. it's a nice warm layer, but doesn't get to hot. pair it with a long sleeve shirt, jeans and some boots and you're set.",pos
I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top. i get the style but if it adds 10lbs to your middle area its not for me. it is a thin material so it does hang nice.,neg
"This dress is chick but funky! the material is knit but not the usual itchy knit. it's comfortable and cool. the colors of the stripes are cool - they're earthy and go well with black, brown, blue and gray. this is going to be a favorite for years.",pos
"I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer",pos
"This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.",pos
"I wanted to love this dress. the cut, fit and color are adorable. unfortunately the fabric is super thin. due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s. i was on the fence of keeping it, but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it. i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue. i am most likely going to return it; even at 15% off, it is over-priced for the cheap",neg
"I love sweaters like this. it's perfect over a tank top for a casual every day look. it's soft, comfy, and i love the length. one more thing i like is that while it looks great just open, there is a snap to fasten it if you want to.",pos
"Amazingly soft jacket! tried this on and three sales girls all said they wanted it! the other reviewer said there wasn't any pockets but yes there are- they are sewn so you have to undo the stitching but they are there!! perfect jacket at a great price. first time i wore it, i received several compliments.",pos
"Oh my. so soft, so delicious, i love this sweater.

absolutely my new favorite. buy this. you won't be disappointed. the neck is soft and not irritating at all like the other reviewer said.

look how big the hood is if you so want.",pos

"I am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs. her clothing is intricate, boho, colorful and fits like a dream. when i saw this online i had to have it. it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be! the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic. the dress definitely has some room, but it isn't quite as swingy as the catalog photo. i have a lot of curves, so it may be swingy on a more slender figure. i ordered an xl mostly because of the s",pos
"I didn't look at this dress twice online but when i tried it on in the store i was floored. it was beautiful, flattering, and so much fun.",pos
"This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim. i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering, it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places. the color is not true: it is black stripes on gray (not cream). i thought the stripes might flatter my shape, but alas, i did not look good in this.

the material is very nice, soft and stretchy.",neg
I love this top and bought my usual xs. i don't have any issues with the buttons gaping but am 34b so i'm not a busty girl. i got the adorable umbrella print and living in a rain forest in southeast alaska it could not be cuter.,pos

I adore these pants! comfortable as jammies and i wear with both sandals and booties. every time i wear them i am complimented on them!,pos
"This is a surprisingly cute faux-fur coverup! it's much cuter in person than on the model. i will be wearing mine over a little black dress, for the holiday parties. it's very glam! perfect for going out. it's also very soft, snuggly, and comfy. most faux fur makes me look gigantic and wide, but this one looks a bit like a little capelet or shrug, and very flattering. it flares out nicely in the back too, and it has a pretty lace-knit stripe pattern on the back. it does shed a bit though. also,",pos
"I have had this dress for a few months now and find it is super comfortable for the hot weather and can go dressy or casual with the right accessories. it does run large in xxs; the xxs petite fit a little better by was way too short for me. even better is that you can wash on the super gentle cycle and lay flat to dry. yes it says dry clean only, but its is made of cupro and you should be able to wash that material. i have washed mine several times and it has never shrunk or lost shape. the she",pos
"I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately, the material used for this particular jean is a far, far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.

don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.",neg
"Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a rehearsal dinner and i couldn't believe how beautifully it fit. fitted through the top, falling to a gorgeous flare. hit her at knee (she's 5""6'). classic, elegant, femme fatale look that will work for a range of occasions.",pos
I bought this tee in most of the colors available. that's how much i liked it. it's not tissue thin; it's a good medium weight. it does't hug the body too closely. i am 5'4 and 140 lbs with a little post partum belly and this is a really flattering tee in m.,pos

i gave it as a gift to a friend who wears a smaller size than me.",pos
While being stylish. the dress is well made and comfortable.,pos
This kimono is beautiful! pictures definitely do not do it justice! i love the details of the beading and sequins throughout. the only downfall is that they can snag and get fall off quite easily. delicate but still my fav kimono ever.,pos
This shirt runs very large. i will be returning for a smaller size.,neg
"I was nervous about this purchase, but it turned out to be a new favorite. the blue color is stunning on and i can easily see this taking me from work to dinner. i am normally a size 2 or 4 in dresses. after reading reviews about how this dress runs large, i ordered a 2 and hoped i didn't have to return it. the 2 is perfect and roomy. the drawstring can be let out or in for more figure definition. this really is a beautiful and modest dress.",pos
"I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren't really my style and these prints wouldn't be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them, this skirt is really that fabulous.

I love this top in peach! i usually wear a size 8 and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store. it fits well but loose. i usually front tuck it in. what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders. very effortless but doesn't feel like it is falling off. a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up (and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders) due to elastic in the shoulder. this top h,pos
"Completely in love with this dress! i'm a huge fan of byron lars, and this one by far is my favorite. everything about this dress is perfect. it's very well made too. i usually wear a size 4, but kept the size 6 instead. the waist felt a bit too tight with the 4. btw: the belt is adjustable.",pos
"Love the simple non-fussy style of this dress. note that the color is not ivory, as described and expected (not the first time retailer makes that mistake), however i still found the oatmealish-warm beige color to be flattering to my skin tone (warm tones look best on me). like that the shoulders are covered while still feeling sleeveless, gives it a dressier feel. the fine texture is lovely. this does drape up top, while the bottom clings a bit, but not overly much for me to feel immodest. i am 5",pos

"It's hard purchasing clothes online. i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring. when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee. if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size, i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect.",pos
"I love this dress. based on reviews, i ordered the small, and the only problem i had was that, while the dress is quite large, the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted, which i didn't find comfortable. so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own, and the results are great. the fiber content contains a bit of wool, but i do not find it scratchy to my skin. and i am lovin' the hi-lo aspects of the hem. fun dress for winter!",pos
"I had four weddings this fall and tried this dress on but ended up not purchasing because i already had dresses to wear. but, i told myself i would purchase the dress if it ever went on sale. i don't have an occasion to wear it yet but i can't wait! the dress is so lovely and the details are beautiful. the only thing i'm worried about is the possibility for some of the embroidered parts to pill. it looks very flattering and hugs all my curves beautifully.",pos
"I love the design and fit and quality. have been looking for a long-line top like this and was willing to pay full price. i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely. smooths it all out. i'm a 38c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top.

"I ordered the coral, size small, it's a beautiful peach color and the linen is very soft. it is longer, and roomier in the waist than i was expecting, however, with skinny jeans it looks great. the detail makes this top very eye-catching, i'm very happy with my purchase!",pos
"The blue looks a lot more grey in person and i've gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties. the texture/print is really unique. i'm 5' 11"" 135 pounds and a small fits perfect. highly recommend!!",pos
"The material is so soft, and lightweight without being sheer. i am 5'1 #145 and ordered a size 28 in blue. they have a relaxed fit, and a polished-casual look.",pos
This top is amazing. so soft and the off the shoulder part stays where it belongs. i'm usually a large but got this in a med. fits perfectly.,pos
"This dress fits perfect! the material is so soft and hangs so flattering. long enough to cover the booty, but short enough to show off my legs. and the color is beautiful (i got the wine color).",pos
I wish we had cooler weather in california so i could wear this more often. i bought this sweater/coat on sale plus an extra 20% off so i got a great deal on it. i love this sweater! it looks matronly in the picture but it looks very chic and sophisticated in person. the sleeves hit above the wrist as shown on the model. it does have pockets. it's the right weight for chilly weather.,pos
"I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it. i am usually a m/size 10 but as this tee is fairly sheer, i did better exchanging for a large. the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable. a must have for yogis!",pos
"I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming, and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters, with tights, boots, boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors, and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job, sparrow! btw, i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress), and this one is just an inc",pos
I really love this sweater. beautiful color and nice texture. i can't wait to wear it.,pos
Some of the reviews about this being cheap fabric made me nervous about purchasing...but i did and i love it! the material isn't super thick but i like that as i tend to run hot. it's super soft material and feels good on!!,pos
"This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure. this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure - small waist, feminine hips.",neg
"Luv this top/dress/coverup..runs a lil big...i sized down for a more fitted look to pair it with cropped skinny jeans! fabric is nice, comfortable and light!",pos
"This has quickly become my favorite sweater. i am thinking of getting another one in case mine wears out! it's comfy-cozy and soft. love it layered over t-shirts or long sleeved collared shirts, and am looking forward to trying it with a dress and bare legs once it's warmer out. it runs kind of big. i'm 5'8"" and usually a size 6/8 and i got an xs. the s fit too.",pos
I love this top. the quality is topnotch and it's true to size. it's not skintight but it's also not so roomy that you look pregnant! one thing that surprised me is that it's a silk material. i thought it was linen or something like that. but i love it!,pos
"Dark burgundy sweater, cable pattern in front (subtle; hard to see online) embedded with panels of brown tweed in peplum section. beautiful fall sweater.  soft and comfortable. looks great with skinny jeans, would also look nice with a casual skirt or pants.  beautiful color.  slightly roomy fit (not fitted, but not boxy)...true to general size. love this for fall and winter.  flattering, comfortable, unique.",pos
"I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look - not going for romantic. smoky eye, skinny dark jeans under it and pumps. swings further from body than i thought.

i'm 5'7"", wear a 34b and am typically a size 2. that's the size i bought. fits well and while pretty, it's made with heft ... not overly delicate - can't see this snagging. it's more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans. detail at the neck gives it more interest.",pos
"I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors, and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season, this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in, but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy, flowy, and the white version is sheer, but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!",pos
"This blouse is so beautiful - the collar, sleeves, material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered, which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow, and be about two inches longer.

i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5'4"", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material.",neg
"The cut of this dress is designed for any figure! the back hem sweeps as you walk, and the pleats prevent the material clinging to places you want to downplay, such as bulges. even flat chested women can look curvy and lovely in this dress. only downside, if any, is the lavender coloring which doesn't do much for impact if you are pale skinned and fair. i'm blonde, and while i got lots of compliments on the becoming flow of the dress, even i can see it doesn't say wow because i kind of fade away",pos
"It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. the color, cut and delicate details are perfectly balanced with a moderately sexy neckline! ladylike with a little attitude. the fabric is gorgeous and is a stunning shade of midnight blue. this dress is perfect for a summer beach party or to attend a wedding. cut is extremely flattering, and the halter tie top allows for adjustment for a perfect fit. 
i just received it today, and it is a must have for any closet. 
tried it on with a be",pos
"Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l",neg
"I absolutely love the way this skirt looks and fits. i have a smaller waist and larger hips so it is hard to find a pencil skirt that fits, but this skirt fits great! the material has some stretch to it but is still thick and looks really nice. the colors are beautiful, i bought it in the ""red"" which is really just multi-colored. i want it in the green now, too!",pos
"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"".
it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well.",neg
"I am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size 31. i don't have stick legs, and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together. with the old pilcro material, this did not happen! this is a super soft jean, and although the fit was good, they just didn't last.",neg
I saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down.  is perfect!  one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own.  was worried the waistband would be unflattering since i'm short and curvy but it's very flattering.  can dress up or wear to the beach.  i love it!!,pos
Fantastic price right now and very flattering!! cute and sexy dress that hugs but its forgiving!,pos
"I tried this on in-store. it is super cute! i am waiting for it to go on sale because i wasn't sure it was completely worth the price. if you are in-between sizes, take the larger size.",pos
"I ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color! looks great with my blonde hair. the bell sleeves, which are all the rage right now, add to the feminine look. i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look!",pos
"I absolutely love this top, it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style. short waist nice soft colors. i ordered another top that is this style. perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments.",pos
I am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues. i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive. this swimsuit does the trick. makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat. love this suit!!!,pos
Great casual top with flare. looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans. flattering with peplum in back. nice cut for shoulders and neckline.,pos
"This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck.",neg
"These are such under-rated pants! i love the fit, style, fabric & everything about them. they are the perfect weight & can be worn with boots, sandals, flats, etc. they run tts - i got my usual 26. get yourself a pair while they last. you won't regret it.",pos
"This is a full swing top. because the top is so full, it should hit at or slightly above the waist (and it does on me) so that a pant or skirt waistline can be seen and balance out the proportions. will look great with a pencil skirt or any pant that as a mid or high rise fitted waist and flat front (no pleats or draw string, for example). the fabric has weight and hangs nicely. color is true to photos. easy way to look a little dressier during summer. 5'3"" 120lb 34b - small regular fit me perfe",pos
These bottoms are super comfortable. i think they run a little big for a small. i bought another swimsuit from retailer and the bottoms are also small and fit a little better than these. it goes well with the peplum swimsuit top. im so excited about wearing them this season!!,pos
"This dress is super soft, beautiful on, perfect fit!",pos
"I love this sweater. i bought it on sale in maroon and it is the most comfortable sweater ever. i like to wear it with leggings. it has a nice, oversize fit and is perfect for ""fat"" days. or any day.",pos
"These jeans are very comfortable, with the higher waist. they have a slight stretch and keep their shape. i also like that the inside is a darker color, which looks good when rolled up.",pos
"Like the other reviewer, i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores. i tried both the medium and the small. usually at retailer, i wear a medium. however, this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me. it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers, making my bottom look bumpy. when i tried on the small, the dress fit and flattered me perfectly! by far the best dress i ever owned. i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing. fo",pos
This sweater is so cute!!! i intend to wear it as much as possible. the little elbow patches are a cute detail. it's warm but classy.,pos
"This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo, the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale, i may try to tailor it to work, but unless you are willing to do that, its a no go. :-(",neg
Love this top! perfect for fall/winter! it does run large but it looks great! love!,pos
"I am wearing a bodysuit and long skirt from bhldn for my wedding, and i bought this skirt to change in to for my reception. it is perfectly elegant, yet simple. i cannot wait to wear it on my big day! it can be dressed up or down so easily! love it!",pos
I tried this on in-store in white and in grey. it is so super comfy and really cute. i love the wide straps! i ended up getting it in white and black. the grey looked a tad bit more casual than the white and black tanks.,pos
"When this dress first came out i thought it was weird.  then i started seeing people on instagram wearing outfits that look super cute and i wanted it, but sold out.  so when this version came out i snatched it up right away.   it's different from anything else i own, very quirky and in style details and has a bit of a man repeller vibe, that is why i love it.",pos
Got this today and highly recommend it! it fits perfectly and is very flattering! i can see wearing this all wear round! perfect date shirt!,pos
I love this simple but stylish t shirt - the fabric is soft and it fits true to size and i knew i would love it even before it was delivered. i recommend it!!,pos
"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5""2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9"". hope this helps!",pos
The dress is extremely high quality! i purchased the dress in black. the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress. the dress overall is like a balloon. unless you're extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger! i ordered the small petite and am 125 lbs and 5'4. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it's going back:( the petite hits 3 inches above the knee for reference.,neg
"I loved it but can understand the mixed reviews. i am 5'7"" and a size 2-4 usually. 32d. you need to be on the tall side for it to work. definitely will not work if you are petite. i can also see if you have a fuller chest how it would tent and look like a maternity top. i have that happen with off the shoulder styles. that said, if it works, it is great. i didn't size down went with s) because the xs didn't hang well. it was too short at the shoulders and neckline. again, probably need to be in",pos
"This blouse is stunning. it's ultra feminine but has a bit of bohemian feel to it. i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered an xs at first in both colors but they were a little big in the bust area and under the arms. my bust size is 32c. i ordered the xxs in both sizes (not petite, as i have a longer torso) and they fit perfectly! they are not too snug anywhere and it makes the blouse look even better - obviously - because it fits better. the hem of the shirt in a size xxs hits right below the hip b",pos
"It just didn't work for me. i don't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs, but this dress was a strike out. the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts. for reference, i am 5'7"" and 145lbs with 36"" 30"" 40"" measurements and i purchased a medium. the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated. the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy. overall, very good quality and beautiful",neg
"This dress is amazing! ordered one with a discount (the dark blue with flowers print) and it was becoming my go-to for work so had to bite the bullet and order two other colors full price. size m fit perfect 5'7"" 150#",pos
"Really cute skirt. found it to be too much material on my frame - 5'4. would look really great on someone taller. the tie in the front was pretty, but a bit bulky on me and ultimately i want a skirt i can wear both ways - with shirts tucked in or out. this one is tuck in only so sending back. will look really great on someone else though! nice knee length skirt.",pos
"Birthday gift from my husband, and i have it hanging up where i can see it, the design is like a huge beautiful tapestry. although it looks heavy, the cotton has a nice feel to it. hand-embroidered here and there. i usually wear size s/m and the med. is very comfortable. gorgeous!",pos
This is my new favorite sweater. it is lightweight and drapey. very flattering. can be dressy or casual.,pos
Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.,neg
"Beautiful and soft and so well made cropped cardigan by the in house retailer branding. the color is more muted in person but will work with many different skirts and pants including jeans. i have many ideas for this lovely cardigan ! the size medium for my 34 dd chest, 145 lbs and 5 '4 inches is perfect and the sleeves bellow out a bit which gives this cardigan a nice sharp look. i agree with the other reviewer--- more colors and more of type of quality  and character please for seasons ahead! lo",pos
"This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup. i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed. i bought the white -- i always buy white it seems, but loved it so much, i came back for the blue. get this and live effortlessly this summer.",pos
"Beautiful material, great design. get a bigger size.",pos
"I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.",pos
"What a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket! the swing styling on this jacket is so cute---not too full-, you still get a nice silhouette from the front, with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple. it will be a ""go-to"" piece in my closet!! the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful!!! as other reviewers have commented, it does run large. i am exchanging it for a size down. i can't wait to get it in and wear it!",pos
"I'm always weary of v necks but this shirt is great. the fit is true to size and while it is a v neck, it's not such a deep plunge that you need a cami underneath. great material too and perfect for dressing up a bit. i bought the blue color and love it!",pos
"I have a love affair with pilcro and these jeans make my heart throb. i've been stalking these jeans online and tried them on in the store yesterday. i'm 5'9"", curvy, and was concerned that they would make my legs look like tree trunks swathed in denim with miniature cartoon feet protruding from below the hem. not so. they fit like a glove, rested perfectly at my lower calf, hugged around the hips and waist, and flared without looking like church bells. seriously, if you're a cropped pants fan,",pos
"Simply awesome. wonderful fit and flatters any body type. looks great booties, flats, or flip flops. must have ...",pos
"I have purchased several pairs of these pants and love them. i got two pairs last fall, one in purple and one in red. i purchased a pair in sand this spring, and just purchased pairs in the violet and taupe last week. i purchased the violet to replace the purple pair i bought last year (stained them then first time i wore them). these pants are great, but the violet color doesn't quite match the color in the picture (which looks very similar to the pair i bought last year). in person, the violet",pos
"These leggings are a quality product at a great price! i ordered these for my daughter and she loves them. warm and comfy, she wears them all the time.",pos
I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!,pos
"I love this duster! i got my usual size and it fits exactly as pictured. the color of the fabric is a perfect neutral and will look good with anything. the knit is open and fairly see-through, this avoids the bathrobe look that a long length sweater can have. bought at full price and i'm not sorry because i bet it will be gone before long!",pos
"I ordered my usual size 6 from retailer and it fit perfect. for reference i am 5'8"" and 137 pounds. unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress. it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest;) i really like this dress. i think it's beautifully made. is it my favorite dress i've purchased from retailer, no but still a nice dress:)",pos
This sweater is buttery soft and warm. it is long and you will want every color. i bought the sky blue and it looks fabulous with so many outfits. i had to get the gray color also. the sleeves are a soft fitted rib material and the body is long and roomy. love love!,pos
"This blouse combines two things i love - swing tops and bows. just received this and am very pleased. the blue version is very pretty. i recently purchased another top by the same brand and ordered a 6. for this, i ordered a small and am glad i did. i would suggest ordering your regular size (the top is fitted, the bottom is very fluid).",pos
"I bought the white in a m, one size down from my normal. i could have gone with a s, given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen. it is very light and comfortable. the length is a tunic on me, at 5'6"", so keep that in mind. if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure. i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes. i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two. if they get black or grey i will def. buy another one.",pos
The fit on this skirt is flawless. i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me. the buttons are so adorable and the color (orange) is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer. will wear this a lot!,pos
"Get creative with the neckline or let it fall where ever. this is a purposefully slouchy, uber casual, super soft",pos
"Cloth and stone never lets me down! awesome quality, comfort, and versatility. i imagine myself living in this dress this summer! soft fabric, easy breezy fit, pockets, machine washable...what's not to love? go buy it!",pos
"I'm glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one. i bought this in a medium (usually wear a 10/12) and it fit perfectly. the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeans/pants/shorts. the lace detail is just gorgeous! the bottom flows more loosely, but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans.",pos
"Lovely dress ,comfortable fabric and great cut .
the combination of the alignment of stripes works beautifully and is very figure flattering.
versatile to keep casual or dress up with a great pair of shoes.",pos
This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline. love it!,pos
"I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.",pos
This runs super big and it just wasn't flattering--way too much fabric. i wanted to love this dress.,neg
This dress is so cozy and soft. love it! the cowl is big in a flattering way. absolutely adore the buttons that run down the back of the dress. such an unexpected detail which makes retailer pieces so special. i would layer tights and tank underneath anyway so the see through aspect other reviewers mentioned wasn't apparent to me and also wasn't as big a deal.,pos
"This tank is not very flattering. there is a lot of fabric, it's very boxy, & the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey. i even sized down and it's still just wide. i'm returning :(",neg
"I saw this in the store and decided to try it on. it is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i didn't think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front. when i put it on, i didn't mind them at all. it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors. dry clean only is the only drawback to this one.",pos
"Such a pretty fall sweater. nice fit. wore it once out shopping and it snagged :( had to return, sadly.",neg
"I am 5'2"" and 125 pounds and wear a 4p. i ordered the size 4 with the willingness to hem them; my goal was to get this true high-wasted style, which is extremely flattering. when the pants arrived, i was first struck by their high quality fabric and the top notch tailoring. the fabric is substantial yet it drapes beautifully. the true high waist flatters, but the buttons and slant pocket details further whittle the waist. i am so happy with my purchase!",pos
"I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium, boy is it huge, the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable, even the small would be giant! 
for reference i normally wear a size 8/10 my chest is 34 e and this was just so so huge, it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i am.
the colours are true and nice and vibrant... definitely size down with this one",neg
"This skirt is perfect-it can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it. it is a thick fabric so it keeps you warm (being a freeze baby i really like that). while the fabric is thick, it is soft, and it is moveable rather than being super stuff. it is not at all itchy. it is a little longer than i would prefer in a pencil skirt but i ended up keeping it anyway. this was somewhat compounded with the fact that i did end up sizing up on this dress. my normal size tending to stay at my",pos
"This sweater is the best sweater to throw on over a buttoned blouse, t-shirts, long sleeves, tanks. i always get comments on how comfortable and adorable this sweater is. a worthwhile buy.",pos
"Unbelievably soft fabric that doesn't feel like it will pill. i ordered dark grey. i'm 5'3"" 130 (just after baby) and size m fits well, super-flattering. doesn't smash my buns. the seams are in all the right places to flatter. styling is between ballerina and badass, as i think the ankle wraps look a little tough. i highly recommend.",pos
"I usually get a large in tops that don't come in tall due to my long torso. thanks to the reviews on this one, i got the white top in a medium.  the medium fit perfectly.   it looked just like it does on the model and not like a maternity top at all.  the material is thick enough that the white wasn't see through.  i paired it with some crop skinny pants and a statement necklace and received many compliments on it.  the top is a little bland and needs some kind of jewelry to really make it.  oth",pos

"This coat is very soft and flattering in design. good quality and very comfortable. i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well. if anything, it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward, so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath, go up a size.",pos
"I tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section.  couldn't stop thinking about the dress though, so checked reviews online from home...many said to size up. i ordered a medium and it is perfect! fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy!! i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good.",pos
"I am 5-9 1/2"" tall, 150 lbs, i bought the 8 in the honey color. they fit perfectly. there is some stretch and they are super soft! which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes. the length is good since they are capris. also, they did not have my size in store, so they had them shipped, for free, to my home. received them within 3 business days.

i would very much recommend them for a casual, fun look. the honey color will look great with navy, grey, and white for summer.",pos

"Strapless dresses can be so flattering so when i saw this on retailer i had to order it! this dress did not disappoint. for reference i ordered a size 4 and i am 5'5"", 135 lbs, 34b chest. in the chest area it fits perfectly, while the ribcage area is a little snug, but not uncomfortably so. the pockets are great. the denim quality is great. and i like the frayed bottom of dress. i got compliments straight away on the beauty of the dress from two men. which i thought was quite interesting because i",pos
Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.,pos

"I love this top but make sure to size down! i am usually a small in blouses and the size s was like a tent! returned for an xs. overall, the fabric is a great quality and the colors are stunning. the orange isn't too harsh. a keeper for sure!",pos
"This dress fits beautifully. the fabric is thick enough to feel significant and not flimsy, but the dress doesn't feel heavy at all. the detail is gorgeous, but still subtle. it's a little too nice for me to wear to work, but the perfect special occasion or party dress",pos
I originally got this for myself but it was just a little bit more snug than i liked. i ended up giving it to my daughter. it fits her nicely and she wore it to her holiday party at work and it was a hit!!,pos
"I love this top! i have all 4 colors in size large. i'm 5'9 170 lbs with a large bust. it's a loose fit that is very flattering. do not dry i wash in cold water and hang dry. first one i bought i dried and it shrunk quick a bit. if you are tall, size up.",pos
The best shirt to throw on with a pair of shorts and it's effortlessly adorable!,pos
"I wanted to love this kimono...it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe, but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric...not a soft touch and because it runs small. i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i couldn't bring the kimono together in the front (for a belting option).",neg
"Love the muted pattern in the blue and spots of gray, front and back. i wore this with my gray legging/pants. the pleats allow for a relaxed fit; very comfortable over all.",pos
"Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist, it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu",pos

"I absolutely love these shorts! i wear a 28 in all pilcro and these are no exception. i would not have grabbed these to try on, but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me. first, they are definitely short when rolled twice, and i do not have skinny legs. in fact, i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them. for some reason, these shorts make my legs look great! i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer, but i still like them at home",pos
Loved the flared style of this cardigan. i first choose the yellow and returned it for the navy. the knit pointelle design is interesting and the cardi is so soft. have used it many times already - always makes me feel great.,pos
"Beautifully embroidered dress.  it's loose fitting, not meant to be tailor fitted, so it would run large to you if that's what you were expecting.  the colors are gorgeous and the skirt has a really beautiful flow.  if you are hoping for a fitted look, size down one size.  there is plenty of stretch to this dress and plenty of room in the bust and waist.  i generally go between 00p and 0p, and got this in a 0p (though either would work).  it comes to just above my knees at 5'2"", 110, 32-24.5-32.",pos
"Looks like a pregnancy top. a lot gathers in front and back. added 10 pounds to me. not flattering on, much longer than on the model. and the color is not white. it's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe.
i returned it same day i received it, which was disappointing.",neg
I love this dress's gentle blue lace. the silhouette is just as seen in the pictures. i found the dress tight in the chest and had to size up one size (6 to 8).,pos
The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.,pos
"It's a cute topper. it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms, and because of the a-line, through the bottom. but the chest is 3 sizes too small and i don't have a big chest. the fabric is very scratchy, and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped, and i suspect it had been worn.

going back. not tracy reese's best piece.",neg
This top is awesome! it fits well and has a flattering shape. it's true to size and i love it!,pos
"I love this shirt. it is soft, romantic and flowy.  i love the material it is probably one of the softest things i own. great quality and lightweight.",pos
I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale. definitely worth the wait. the quality and designs are superb true to size,pos
"This cute top is made in the usa- yay! it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets. i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric. the black and white was cute, but hung strangely and felt stiff. i am size sm/med, 34c and went with the small. cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm.",pos
"This is the ideal easy-breezy sweater to throw over leggings when you just feel like being comfy, cozy, but still stylish. i love it.",pos
"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me, if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also, for the price, material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2"", 114#, 34b",neg
"I've been looking for a black off-the-shoulder dress and found this baby in store today. for reference, i am 5'8"", 34b, 140-150 and took a small. this dress is a shift/swing style, so if you're looking for something fitted this isn't your dress. as another reviewer mentioned, ladies who are busty may not like this as the ruffle at the top could add unwanted volume. if you are extremely thin or petite, i might size down, but i like my clothing loose vs. fitted so i kept the small. the fabric is g",pos
"I ordered the moss green color. i love it! the color is really cool, the length is longer, and the fabric is soft. great summer option!",pos
I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer. i'm so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off. the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward. they were also not as soft as i expected them to be.,neg
"A fun dress to just throw on go, nice details in the bodice, mix of blues in the prints, little longer in back is nice detail for those of us who want a shorter dress but not the worry of flashing from behind",pos
A perfect little simple style summer dress just throw it on with some trendy sandals and off you go. runs true to size. just wished they would of made it in other colors and prints.,pos
"I love this blouse, it's very unique and gorgeous. this blouse is versatile with short, jean and skirt. love it!!!",pos
"This dress is so comfortable and looks so good. i love the low back and the swing in the skirt. i ordered the tangerine, which is really more red than orange. this is a simple, slip-on dress, perfect for traveling as it doesn't wrinkle. i will wear this often when the warm weather arrives.",pos
This skirt is gorgeous!! drapes beautifully & the color is vibrant! get it!! you'll be so pleased! i sure am!!!,pos
"The photo does not do this dress justice at all. it's a light lavender and extremely flattering. i'm athletic so have broader shoulders and hips, and this is an amazing fit for me. also, the front has a small button to make it more modest, which is closed in the photo of the model, but if you leave it open, va-va-va-voom! so, to summarize: beautiful spring lavender, fabulously feminine fit. get it!",pos
"Maybe i didn't read the description correctly, but i was surprised that this skirt has two front slits, thigh-level, rather than just one, as shown in the photo above. it's gorgeous silk, the patterns are vivid, and the pleats are classy, giving just the right balance of form and flow. however, when i sat down, very little coverage!! ...which means i wouldn't wear it much. i considered taking it to my tailor, but too much effort and $$. however, it's beautifully crafted if you're looking for som",pos
"I love this top. i ordered it in a large thinking it would be a tight rib but it is not so i reordered it in a small. i am 5'7"" 145lbs 34g chest. the small fits perfectly and probably could have taken an xs. it is stretchy but fits wonderfully. i bought the black. i love how the neck snaps and adds a little pizzazz to a simple black turtle neck. i'm wearing it today with straight leg jeans and my leopard print ballet flats. i feel like audrey hepburn!! i will not be dry cleaning it. i will wash",pos
"I spotted this pj pants in the store, tried it on, and love it! the material is very soft and comfortable. the fabric is on the thin side, thus, one star off the quality. the pattern/color varies, the one i got has more pinkish flowers. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, and size s fits nice. i could probably go down to a size xs, but i like my pj pants to fit a bit roomy, therefore size s fits better. the length is more like ankle length on me since i am petite. it is very cute on and perfect for a chill summe",pos
"I didn't notice this dress online but it jumped out at me at the store.  i sized down to a small as the bust and arm area seemed very loose in  medium.  (36b). it's very comfy and beautiful.  i tried it with  a belt,  but quite honestly  it doesn't need one and it looks so much nicer without one.  not sure about what bra to wear ...likely strapless , or as one person said. .none.",pos
"I have loved ag stevie ankle denim for awhile now and have never been disappointed with the fit or quality. this pair is no exception to that. i am 5'5"" and about 113, slender with athletic thighs and the 26 fit great. buying them on-line, i wasn't able to check how distressed the denim was. the pair i received in the mail was indeed slightly different in the distressed locations from the on-line image. mine had no distressing on the upper thigh and one medium and one small spot on each leg. onl",pos
"This dress is gorgeous, well made, lined, and tts. i get compliments each time i wear it and find it unique yet classy and appropriate for work. unlike some of the maeve tops i have purchased this year, it does not run big, and if you are banking on a little stretch, i would order the next size up. you won't be disappointed!",pos
"I fell in love with this dress two years after it sold out so i'm so lucky to have gotten my greedy little hands on this eye catching retro modern number. my mom adores the fit on me as it reminds her of her youth in the 50's and 60's. i originally sized down to a 6, not realizing my bust/wide rib cage would make the fit difficult. wish i could have found an 8 but settled for 10p and will have a tailor finish it. i'm also going to remove the tulle layer since i want to wear as more casual frock.",pos
"I didn't go with the intention of even looking at a dress, but decided to try this on. once i did, i knew that i had to get it. it's so cute. i got the one listed as green motif, which is actually a royal blue bodice. the colors are vibrant and it's so comfortable.",pos
"I love this shirt. it is very soft and the lace on the sleeves adds an extra element. i liked this shirt so much, that i ordered a second one.",pos
I saw this on line this morning and was hesitant to order one size smaller so decided to visit local anthopology store with fingers crossed they would have it in a size 4. i'm 5'5 130 and a size 6 usually in retailer clothing. not only was the size 4 perfect the fabric and quality are excellent. nice flowy pant legs and the top has a one button adjustment on the shoulder if you don't want it too low. either way worked for myself. dress up or down. this is a must!,pos
This dress is so flattering and just beautiful in person. love it!,pos
"This top us flowy, breathable, and feminine. the fabric is light so it doesn't feel like you're wearing a swing dress with heavy fabric. it is sheer so a cami underneath is best. with flowers, less structured tops, i size down to a small or 6. some other tops i'd go to medium or 8.",pos
"Love this dress! very flattering. material is thinner and more lightweight than i was imaging but it is great. it really does run small, like the other reviewers said -- glad i ordered one size up, fits perfectly!",pos
"I tried this on in the store because i have had my eye on it for a while and i want to be sure i get the correct size. as other reviewers have said, it does run large. i normally wear a s and the xs was big on me. i could go with the xxs, but of course it appears to be sold out now. the lighter colors look like they would be slightly sheer, but the navy blue and red are not. i thought the material was good quality. not sure if it would shrink. top is rather long on the back, but the picture does",pos
"I like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy. the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful, i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year. it has to go back though, just too large. i don't love it quite enough to order a size down.",neg
"Love, love, this top! it's flattering (shows off your shoulders) soft and has delicate embroidery. i typically order a xxsp in antro tops as i'm very petite but decided to order both xxsp and xxs, just to see the difference. the xxs worked better as the xxsp was too short in length and kind of looked like i was trying to fit into a child size top. the xxs is a perfect length. it's my new favorite and i can see keeping this in my wardrobe for a long, long, time.",pos
When i wore this dress i got tons of compliments! the quality is great along with the style.,pos
I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model. i ordered my usual size 0 but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable. i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasn't as form fitting as i would have liked. i ended up returning this dress.,neg
"Got this dress for a party.  it was a last minute purchase and i was nervous if it would fit.  it not only fit, it looks great and is very comfortable.  have to love an a-line skirt and a top with short sleeves.  it covers everything while looking sexy.  and i didn't have to spend a second worrying if something was showing that shouldn't be.  got compliments all night.  i got it in red and black but went with the red based on feedback from husband and bff.  buy it now.  its perfect for holiday p",pos
"Pretty cut out design. it is a great length for work but it is also unique enough to get compliments. the skirt seems true to size but the waist does not have a lot of ""give."" in this regard it may seem a little small.",pos
I saw this top in the store and wanted to try it on but my 18-month-old son was getting cranky so i had to leave. i kept thinking about it and was planning to go back and get it and then i checked online and it was on sale! i purchased the pink and i'm ordering the blue as well. it's very comfortable and i received several compliments when i wore it. i haven't washed it yet but the fabric seems to be sturdy.,pos
"This sweater coat is perfect. i've been looking for one i loved for years. in my opinion, it runs true to size. i ordered my usual xsp. it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body. i love it.",pos
Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,neg
"This wide leg pant gives the perception of a skirt that is feminine, comfortable, and moves beautifully when you walk. can be used all year round!",pos
Stunning sweater for cooler weather. i think it runs a little small so returned first one and ordered one size up which fits perfect.,pos
"I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible, unflattering, and laughable! please try again with this one, retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!",neg
"I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. i'm so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect! it hits at the perfect length for a",pos
"I love any bow tie tops but most have the bow too high up which looks dowdy. i love the layered look and the contrasting colors. i am 100 lbs, 5'3"" and got the regular xs. i wanted the petite xs but it was sold out unfortunately. the regular was a little too big but it still works! looks great with jeans or dress pants....even a skirt! very versatile and classy and creative styling.",pos
"This dress is beautiful and delicate, so flattering! runs a little big- slightly looser fit- got the size small, usually a 6-8, and it is perfect. the slip included is very sheer however, so i am using a different black slip for mine.",pos
This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!,pos
I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.,pos
"Love the length and long sleeves. so comfy to sleep in! great purchase, i ordered the navy one too!!",pos
"I love this for a casual winter day. the fabric is so soft. the draping gives it a unique look. so cozy and nice. it's a bit big, though. opt to size down.",pos
"So first off, yes, these are almost mind-numbingly expensive. however, i think the design and quality are absolutely there. the label ""low-rise"" always makes me wary (as someone who is curvy, low rise often = muffin top danger and bad early 2000s flashbacks), but the low rise design of these is actually great. they are mainly low rise in the front, angling down slightly toward the button, and in the back they are, not super high, but more of a mid rise, so you won't have to be really careful ben",pos
"I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets. however, the material was quite thin and the quality was not great- there were multiple snags along the seams. additionally, at 5'8, 130lbs i was swimming in the size 4. i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better.",neg
"I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.
and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.",neg
I tried this dress on in the store in the mango color but opted to order the blue. the dress is beautifully made and the fit is fantastic.,pos
"Aaaaaaamazing tunic, it was love at first sight and the detail is spot on. the total weight is heavier than expected but that is due to the impeccable quality of the top.",pos
"An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent!",pos
Great shirt. very soft and comfortable. the elastic on top to keep it off shoulders is not too tight--just tight enough. the colors are pretty. it's give a rustic city vibe. love!,pos
"So cute! i get tons of compliments whenever i wear it. very comfortable. i ordered a petite l and it's a little big. i usually buy the petite m, but due to the under slip i wasn't sure.",pos
"I've been shopping with retailer over 10 years and this is my first review. i almost didn't order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies. i'm 5' 2"" and these jeans are perfection! they look amazing with a 2-3 inch heel. i don't think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway. love these!",pos
"I have always been a pilcro fan and these are so comfortable and fit well in the legs. i'm 5'6"" and 128 and the size 26 fit very well.",pos
"I technically measure to a medium in both regular and petite sizing, but i took a chance an ordered the regular small in red. it is as depicted, and i agree that it is soft and can be clingy, but the regular size fits slightly too big on me. this is fine since it would show lumps otherwise. i bet this would be perfect had the petite size have been available. nonetheless, the fabric is substantial enough that it doesn't show the fact i carry weight in my upper body and stomach, so i'm keeping it.",pos
"I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears, then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom",neg
"Oh my goodness, i paid full price for this dress because i loved it so much. i styled it with a cream lace poncho , also from retailer, and it is gorgeous. at the sale price, you can't lose.",pos
"I ordered this in a 2, but returned for a 4 because the arm holes were a little tight. other than that, this is a absolutely flattering dress. u will be wearing it for an outdoor garden wedding shower. the beading around the flowers makes such a different accent. just be careful zipping it up. love it!",pos
"I am currently loving anything that crosses or ties around the stomach area to hide what's left from my most recent pregnancy. this tunic fits the bill. the material has the perfect amount of stretch and the length was just right. i am very petite and bought my usual size xs. i would have liked to try this tunic in a petite size, but then it  may have been too short. i plan on wearing this to work with leggings and for running errands once the weather warms up.",pos
"I love this sweater dress! i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews, but fear not, friends--this is a comfortable, flattering, warm dress with a unique twist. i love the cowl and the buttons down the back. the knit is fairly large so there's some give to it, which means pulling it on is a breeze, and the buttons don't slip out of their closures unexpectedly, which is an added bonus. i ordered both grey and navy. i stand at 5'6"" and would describe myself as pear-shaped, typica",pos
"I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38"" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry",pos
"I'm thrilled with this purchase, and looking forward to spending many years with this classic. on the subject of fit; i generally wear size medium for tops, but my broad shoulders occasionally have me in larges. since the thick-textured fabric is mostly cotton and minimal stretch (with a mix of linen), the larger size will provide more room and comfort. i'm honoring my ""tts"" choice for folks who prefer a more ""fitted"" look. overall this piece wears well!!",pos
"I had been looking for a jacket like this for months, but haven't found the right style, until i saw this one! luckily it was on sale. i am 5'10, weigh ca. 143lb's and i usually wear a size small in all retailer tops. tried on medium, but it was too big in the bust area., then i tried on the small and it fits great! the sleeves are long enough too, but it is hard to move my arms up to reach something, so i just have to avoid that. :) i have gotten a lot of compliments for it.",pos
"It's a light material so it flows. the shine is just enough to dress up when i need. i'm a 12 and usually buy xl of any t-shirt looking style, but the large fit perfectly. i am however not large breasted.",pos
This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.,neg

"This color came out after i had purchased the same in the gray motif. when i saw this one, though, i simply had to have it! it is such a happy print and different color scheme from anything else in my closet. i had purchased the gray one in regular only because the petites were all sold out, but i was able to get this one in my usual small petite size. it is most definitely a better fit/length for me. i don't usually like to pay so much for a t-shirt, but i will splurge for something like this t",pos
"I'm disappointed in these pants, which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice, the fabric is too thin, and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them, so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit, they might wo",neg

"This top! it is so simple, but so great at the same time! it does run large, and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft, washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual, but so comfy. it's great for loungin",pos
"Love this top..got it in both orange and white and always get compliments, especially on the orange color - beautiful and vibrant color! very comfy top and washes well with no problems. the style does swing but not too huge.",pos
"I ordered the xxs because it seems like a flowy top, and glad i did, it fits perfectly. love the blue color, very rich. material is super soft, cut is very flattering, and i love the back. i tried it on with my strapless since that is what i was wearing, but not sure if straps show on a regular bra. (30dd for info)",pos
"I am so crazy about this dress. i got it in the mail today and just love it!  no, it's not lined but it's not see through so no big deal. i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin. i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price!",pos
This dress fits true to size and is great to wear around on a warm day. you can dress it up or down so there are many uses for it. this brand has always provided great quality too. i'm excited for warmer weather!,pos
"This dress is simply unique   beautiful! i said it runs large, but that only because the bodice is a little looser than anticipated. i decided to stick with my normal size 0 though so i could have a little extra room. for those wishing for a tight fit, size down. i love the colors in this dress; i typically shy away from bright colors and pinks but paired with the muted yellow/brown",pos
"Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the ""2"" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i'm normally an retailer small but i don't think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece!",pos
This top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size. love the back detailing. and it is really good t-shirt quality.,pos
"I am 5'1"" and curvy, and purchased this dress in medium petite, and it fits to perfection! i love how light & breezy it is for those hot & muggy summer days. the tie front makes this style very flattering for all body types, and the skirt is lined so it is not see-through! plus, the pockets. this dress is a winner.",pos
"This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.",neg
"Recently bought these on sale, though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4, the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model, but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas, and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy, as sometimes happens with this style.",pos
"These pants are wonderful. they are very flattering, the color is gorgeous, and they are incredibly comfortable. got tons of complements!",pos
"I got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package. one side is see through, so i wore a camisole underneath. it's lightweight and not at all clingy. i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me. perfect sweater for a fall day in new england.",pos
"My new favorite. i purchased the ivory in a medium, and the lilac in a large when it went on sale (medium was already sold out). i'm 5'7"" and about 125 pounds, 34c give or take. the medium fits great, and i found the large only slightly bigger, but it does not look too big. i usually wear a small or medium in most retailer sweaters.
as was previously noted, the back is cut higher than pictured. i actually like this, as it gives the sweater a unique look. i tend to layer with a button down for the",pos
"I have been searching my entire marriage -- 11 years -- for the perfect christmas and valentine's day dress. it had to be red, it had to be the right red, and it had to be my style. there were several i saw over the years that were either too burgundy or too matronly. when i saw this dress, i knew my 11-year search was over! this is the most beautiful and elegant, red, special-occasion dress i have ever seen! i cannot wait to wear it for christmas! i think retailer should have reordered thi",pos
"I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!

beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the ""red"", thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however, the ""red"" tee is actually a light orange color. the ""orange"" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.

i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color, because i really do love the quality of this shirt!",pos
"I knew i would love these pants because of the cute sailor styling, but the unusual green color. i am 5'5"" and thought i would be stepping on them, but i am fine. they are longer than the picture with the model on the website which i expected, but they are fine. the fabric is beautiful and i can't wait to wear them with my white-on-white sneakers. i will also mix it up with sandals. i wrote below that my style is bohemian, but truthfully i dress in all the ways listed below...classic, romantic,",pos
"These jeans are extremely soft to the rich, as well as stretchy and flattering. they do not lose their shape after a whole day of wear. i am 5'3"" and the ankle length fits me as full length. i am a big fan.",pos
Fits well and appropriate for work or going out! love the pop of red in the beads! could easily be worn with a jacket well into fall! i typically wear a 6 and a small fit perfectly. not too short- but hits above the knee! this will get lots of wear!,pos
"The top is cute, but when i received it, it did not feel like cotton. the tag says 100% viscose. i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future! on the plus side, the return was no problem.",neg
I bought the top that goes with the pants & live that it's comfortable to wear at home yet looks good enough to to go anywhere. easy to care for. very happy with this!!,pos
Very comfortable to wear. you can wear it any season.  it runs true to size.  nice fabric.  it&amp;#39;s a simple black dress.  love it!,pos
"Love this top. it's everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white isn't white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it.",pos
"I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too. super cute with jeans! can dress it up too. the only slight negative, if i had to find one, is that i feel like i have to pull it forward, at the neckline every once in a while...it doesn't choke me but just feels like it's heavier in the back so pulls a bit. worth it though! :)",pos
"This is a great sweater. it can be worn ""wrapped"" as on the model, or open like a cardigan. it is a lighter weight knit, perfect for how warm this winter has been. i love the deep purple color. normally between a small and medium and went with the medium in this sweater.",pos
Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.,neg
"This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there's a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it's true to size. i'm 5'1"" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won't have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it's gorgeous!!",pos
"This shirt runs true to size. i'm an xl and it fit perfectly! that is my first reason for loving it. it is super soft and so comfortable i don't want to take it off! the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots, which i love. the ruffle of the shoulders i'm not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different. the color of the photo is very accurate. i love the muted pink in the plaid.",pos
"It is hard to believe that this is called a chemise! it is a fabulous dress! this dress caught my eye in the store and i had to try it on. i went with the navy, which is beautiful and has a great pattern. i had to order a petite xs because the regular xs was loose in my shoulder area. i am petite and narrow and 5'1"". the petite xs was perfect for me. it is quite form fitting and does show curves, lumps and bumps so i wore my dress with spanx tights. it was such an easy dress to wear, looked styl",pos
"I was looking for a simplistic dress because i am graduating in a few weeks but did not really want to purchase anything. i strolled in the store and this immediately caught my eye. i tried it on and fell in love!! it fits perfectly and it is the right length. i love the bust line and the detailing of the straps in the back. i don't think i feel as though i am going to a wedding,but i will feel beautiful especially since this is really big deal and accomplishment. i am an older adult - so i want",pos
I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,neg
"I love these pants. they are beautifully made and appear to be very comfortable. now if i could just get them buttoned! i am a size 8/medium. i bought the large after reading other reviews. i'm not joking when i say i can't button them. i am in such love with them (and still hoping to lose some baby weight), that i am going to keep them in hopes to wear them!",pos
"Love the distressed look and linen-like texture. the back ties cinch in for a custom fit & the knit hood is a nice touch. the length is great! fits tts (exactly as depicted) if not slightly roomy, which i like. absolutely fabulous!",pos
"Well made. color is great, goes from summer right into fall. looks good with sandles and will wear with boots later on. goes well with classic tee, denim shirt or plaid blouse. has a retro/ classic look.",pos
This is online exclusive so i ordered both sizes xs and s. it runs pretty large so i kept size xs. the material can be stretched. but i like the feeling of it and very comfortable to your skin. i am so happy receiving so many compliments wherever i go!!!,pos
"So stunning, i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.",pos
Very comfortable and easy to dress up or down. i get tons of complaints on this dress- it's a definite win!,pos
Runs small. arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest. would not recommend.,neg
I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.,pos
I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting.,pos
"I bought this dress in the print and the moss color and may very well return for the dark gray. for reference, i am 5'2"", 140 lbs. i have been more recently wearing size 6, but a 4 was perfect, so i do think it runs a bit large. this dress has a drawstring that ties in the back and cinches the waist up nicely, and is very flattering. the waist actually hits at the natural waistline and not up on the ribs. the fabric is lightweight and washes well. i washed and immediately hung dry. it was slight",pos
"I waited patiently for this dress to arrive in my local retailer store and loved the design immediately (the green motif). as others noted, it is on the flowly side. for this reason, i went with a size s. i wore it on easter and can't wait to wear it again. i did not have any issues with wrinkling or putting on the dress. it is a simple over the head, no fuss kind of dress. you get to be supremely comfortable and look like a goddess. this is one of those retailer pieces that you will have for years",pos
"I was so excited to receive this dress. i got a petite 4 as i am 5'2"". it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible. it didn't look good on me. the waist line was a bit too high...maybe a regular would have looked better. also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isn't. also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance. i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didn't work for me and i had to send it back.",neg
This has instantaneously become my favorite sweater in my closet. the fit is great- a little oversized which makes it very cozy. i purchased my usual size xs. the shade of red is perfection. i wished it was a tad bit softer but would buy again and again!,pos
"This is a beautiful well designed top. the pattern is laid out to match on each side. the back has a narrow center insert of sheer fabric, for an interesting detail, with wonderful construction. this sheer fabric is also added to the bottom as an edging . this measures only 1 1/4"" wide and lays flat and finished off well. the sleeves have excess fabric for comfort but do not make one's arms look heavy. the unusual neckline shape in the front is well sewn and lays flat nicely. i think this top is",pos
"I bought this top in lavender. this top is light and smooth on your body and true to size. i'm 5'4"", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. it hides the imperfections in the tummy area and i find myself going for this top a lot. it's a very easy to put on and take to it off.",pos
"I really love these jeans! they are so comfortable and are very flattering. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i bought the 28 regular and they fit perfectly. i have high hips, so i appreciate the mid rise in these. the length was perfect too, so i'm glad i did not purchase the tall. the length was the same on me as in the picture. the jeans arrived uncuffed, and they look just as cute without the cuff as they do with. i will definitely wear them with and without a cuff for different looks. i am very happy",pos
"I purchased this in the light red, and love it!!! this top is so incredibly soft and ridiculously comfortable.  definitely worth buying.  the material is high quality and can easily shift from season to season.  wear alone with shorts and wedges for summer or put it over a long sleeve top,  or even a holding horses jean shirt with a pair of black leggings and boots for fall.  
absolutely love the softness and the consistency of the fabric.",pos
"I ordered this in a 4 (34b, 140lbs., 5'8"") because it looked like it would run big, and it definitely does! the 4 fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about 10 lbs. heavier than i am. i am pear-shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy, so i returned it. that said, the material is gorgeous!, as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person. if i had a straight(er) silhouette and a larger bust, this dress would have been a",neg
I bought this on sale in black. it doesn't look like much online but it is very flattering and super thin and airy which is great for warm weather. tts- i'm an 8/10 38c and the 10 fits just right.,pos

"Based on the two reviews on this skirt and, for the sale price i purchased the small--i 'm usually a large/extra large. i carry my weight in the middle, and this skirt stills works. very sofisticated striping, slimming! i haven't experienced any slipping, but i haven't worn it for any great length of time yet. there are numerous ways to create chic looks.",pos
"Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs, which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully, too. i highly recommend this blouse.",pos
"I loved the print on both, but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit, size down. for myself, m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long, covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design, so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.",pos
"Absolutely love this jacket.initially wanted to buy the melita draped jacket, which looks similar to this one, and tried them both on in store. the latter just didn't drape properly and looked more like a bathrobe on me, but this piece is amazing! it falls nicely and the pockets jut out a bit giving it a unique look. the fabric is fluid and soft and it has a tie waist with another tie in the back of the jacket,middle bottom, which is a bit of an added but subtle flair, the color is a bit more 't",pos
"I bought this top in the black with the dobby 4"" shorts in grey and wore them as a set 2 of the 3 days last weekend.
mind you, i am tall, but the neckline is lovely, the smocking creates a nice close drape, and the length and the fullness in the bottom, perfectly offset the short-short concept. got lots of compliments with the 2. 
i generally wear a 12 and ordered a medium which was fit nicely with enough room for a wash and dry going forward",pos
"I have these pants in a larger size, but recently lost some weight and wanted a smaller size.
they are so comfortable and soft and go with everything.
keep in mind that they run a little large and do stretch a bit once you wear them.
just wish they would be available in tall!!!",pos
"I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped ""sweater"" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier.",pos
"This dress, like all byron lars dresses is a work of art. it has true quality of workmanship. and fits like a glove. i always get compliments when i wear any of his dresses and i have 5!. this one is somewhere between casual and dressy. perfect for a dinner out on a saturday night!. order a petite if you are under 5 5""",pos
"I have a hard time finding jeans that fit and these ones are just right! i am 5'8, 125ish lbs and the 26s fix perfectly; they hug in all the right places and they are the perfect length. i will be wearing them uncuffed. there is no effort required to uncuff them, they're not sewn or anything. they have just the right amount of stretch and love the little cute details throughout them. thank you, retailer, for always helping me find great jeans!",pos
"These are the perfect dressy 'jeans'. they are super soft but have the right amount of structure. they sit higher on the waist, which is one reason they are so flattering. the other reason is the flared, long leg! very long, in fact. i'm 5'5, 130 lbs and ordered a size 28. they fit me perfectly but i do have to wear them with my tall heels - which makes them perfect for work, with pumps as well as for casual outfits with tall wedges. if my size wasn't sold out, i'd order another pair - they are",pos
"I am really into this jacket! the fit is nice although it does very slightly large; however, not enough to go down a size for me. all of the different textures are really cool and the details do seem to be pretty slimming, which is always a bonus. i am a bit worried that the wool will pill like crazy though. let's hope i'm wrong and that it lasts!",pos
Cozy and beautiful - everything dreamy sleep pants should be. great for gifting. make bedtime feel a little more pampered.,pos

I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd. it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom. for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy.,neg
Fit great with moving room. colors very vibrant. just right for a house with lots of cool air conditioning!,pos
I ordered this top in xl in the navy print. it fits true to size. it's made of two very soft materials. the printed part looks like sailboats to me. it doesn't wrinkle or have a static problem. the solid knit portion is a good quality too. i love the styling details of the ruffled neck and the middle pleat. it's flattering. i like how the details make this a dressy version of a t-shirt while being very comfortable too.,pos

Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,pos

"Saw these at my local retailer store and almost didn't try them on. so glad i did. they made my legs look long and lean. they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile. the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips, butt and thighs. the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable. i love how i look in these!!!",pos
"The details on these capris are adorable - the stitching and side ribbon detail, the fit, weight of the fabric, everything is fantastic. i got the taupe and moss green because i couldn't decide. i wish they came in more colors. fit, for me, was true to size, i usually wear a 2 to a 4 (size 26 to 27 in denim) and got the 2 because i wanted them to be more fitted. they stretched a bit after wear, but not so much that they were too baggy. i will live in these, this summer. if you want a more fitted",pos
I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i'd try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest wouldn't stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. i'm contemplating purchasing it still because i can't stop thinking about it!!,pos

I don't buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!,pos

"I saw this dress in the store & loved the print so much i had to try it on. i definitely do not own anything like this. i tried on a m & i agree that it runs large & on my petite hourglass frame it was a bit overwhelming. however, i was prepared for that & paired it with a brown belt & absolutely loved it. the belt made the dress a little shorter & definitely accentuated my curves in a good way. such a beautiful, casual dress that is actually comfortable. i can't wait to wear it with tights with",pos
"Ok, so who likes to buy bathing suits? apparently i do, because this one arrived today in the white and rust, and i'm buying the black one in a second! i can't pass up such a flattering suit. the ruched bottom gives just enough extra so it's not skin tight to your bottom. and the top has just the right amount of cover. the whole suit is easy to wear, nicely made, and flattering through the roof.",pos
"These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my ""go to"" black pants for the fall season!",pos
"This top wasn't an eye catcher off the bat but i love nothing more than a dressed up tee, so it's why it made it to the dressing room with me. it has elbow length sleeves, a slub texture, super soft, awesome texture and detail. the slight v-neck is perfect and the overall fit is great. i'm typically a lover of black but the wine color was gorgeous too so i took both into the fitting room with me (the other colors weren't available). surprisingly, the black was not even close to a favorite, but t",pos
I was surprised by the other reviews. expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward. the hi-low cut with so much bulk just wasn't flattering. i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body. the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more. it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as i'd hoped. it went back.,neg
"I bought this originally for my daughter but fell in love with it when i tried it on and kept it for myself! it is a cotton/polyester blend so it is very comfortable to wear. the length fits nice as well. i have received so many compliments wearing it with dress pants and also with jeans! thank you for making an item that is both pretty, flexible, and meets the needs of young women (and their moms!)",pos
"The top fits nice, but after one wear (didn't even washed it) the fabric was all fuzzy. would not recommend it.",neg
"I love this suit, the bottoms ran a bit too big on me. i'm usually a small, but an extra small would have fit more comfortably. the small wasn't huge, so i kept with them and im still very happy with this purchase.",pos
Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s,pos
Love this shirt! got it in white and it will be perfect for spring! very flattering fit!,pos
"This is even nicer in person than it is online. i absolutely love it. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered my usual size small. i probably could have worn an extra small, but don't feel like the small is too big. this could be my favorite purchase of the season.",pos
This blouse is so pretty! i love the neck tie which gives it interest and won't look boring on it's own. i'll wear this all-year round. i ordered an xxs which fits perfect.,pos

"The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves. the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over one's head. it contains wool but is not in the least itchy. in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric . it would be cute with a patterned bottom, like a plaid or dotted pants as shown. doesn't seem to be easy to snag.",pos
"Did not work for me. material was a bit thin, poor quality, the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.",neg
"I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy, very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch, so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!",pos
"I took a leap and ordered this top in both colors. my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill. i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a 16/36h, i knew i needed then to run on the larger side. i love both colorways equally, but that said, the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse. the fit and fabric even feel different! the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei",pos
"The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.",neg
"I have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful! in addition to it having no give, feeling like it will stretch out, and being slightly see-through, it is super scratchy!! it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric.. awful!",neg
"Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away. however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived. while the cut is cute, the fabric is just all wrong. i was expecting a nice, heavy knit-like material, but this feels and looks really cheap - especially given the price of the dress. sadly it is going back.",neg
"I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great. i'm 5'4"" c chest and athletic build - the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them. i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy. there was tons of room in the chest, but it was tight in the shoulders. i really wanted to love this, but there's just too many cut issues. it is a good length for work though.",neg
"Can't wait for the weather to cool so i can wear this! the split back makes it very flattering. 

the 'green' is definitely more brown.",pos
These pants are the perfect weight and comfort. they are cozy enough to wear around the house and sleep in as well. i highly recommend these dreamy pants.,pos
I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.,pos
"I love to shop at retailer for tops that i can wear everyday. they always seem to have pieces that are comfortable, casual, and quite different from what you would find in most stores. this top is exactly that! it fits true to size and is washable. all you need are jeans, boots and a neutral necklace and you are good to go. you can't go wrong if you purchase this top!",pos
"This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light, flowy, and comfortable, but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual, but still unique and beautiful, please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day!",pos
"I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store. i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh. will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 32b, 115lbs), and whilst it is looser on me than the model, i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like, but i will wear mine partially tu",pos
"I don't usually write reviews, but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online. the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white. it gives the appearance of a separate crop top. i would usually wear a small (5'2"" and 125 lbs.). i'm wearing a small in the photo, but ended up going back for an xs. the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf, or dressier with heels and jewelry. i think i'll get a lot of use out of it.",pos
"Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!",pos
"This sweater is light gray, as shown in the photo, not dark gray as the description states. i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small. it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl.",pos
Oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit. i am so glad that i bought it. it is beautiful and fits perfectly. classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color. the design is slimming as well.there is nothing that i would change about it. i may be wearing this for my 60th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future. i love it.,pos
The dress is true to fit and very soft. you can dress it up or be casual with a denim jacket.,pos
"This skirt is worth every penny! it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color -- it is a cream/blue gray making it very versatile. the crochet work is beautiful and cream. it is not too bright to show every dirt mark; the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color. it is a classic, elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come. for me, it is tts mostly (i am usually a 4-6) and the six fits perfectly. it has an",pos
"I was so excited to buy this coat, since i missed out on buying the last one. i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket (i've borrowed my friends). i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original, and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat, and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body. it's disappointing considering the price you pay. i would return if it still had tags on.",neg
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.

2. i love the hyphen chinos, and these fit almost the same, just a bit trimmer. they are not tight, and just skim my body perfectly.

3. i love all the colors. the red is darker than the two hyphen pinks.

4. the pants are comfy enough to be really casual and dressy enough to wear to work.",pos
I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer,pos
"I bought this for my girlfriend with the hope that my presumptive intuition about her style preferences and the fit itself would prove successful. fortunately she loves it and looks amazing in it!

the colors are vibrant and the unique texture really lends itself toward a clothing item that is special- even for retailer.

recommend it highly!",pos
I love the unique style of this dress. the bell sleeves and the rather fitted body that poofs out at the end put the focus on these details. as for fit ... i'm a standard xs petite and the xsp fits to a tee.,pos

"I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.",pos
"Love this coat. it fits very well - i'm 5'6"" and typically wear an 8. it is a bit broad in the shoulders like the other reviewers mention, but that's part of its tailored look. this gorgeous coat breaks up any boring winter outfit. so happy with this purchase.",pos

This is such a unique piece and could be dressed up or down. i can see myself wearing this with skinny jeans and a tee and adding a statement necklace or wearing over a dress. i tend to get hot so i like how light weight this is even though it is lined. it is of excellent quality but may run slightly small (or at least smaller than other items i have purchased through retailer). the drape is extremely flattering and i think that would be true for every figure. my favorite feature is the oversized,pos
"I am 5'3"" and the arms of this sweater run at least 2 inches past my finger tips. if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall, it just doesn't work. also, i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online. sigh.",neg
"Saw this online- my size out (xs/s p). online did have xs. checked store saw how great the dress looked at store, able to try on only one avail at store (m). ordered xs online. fits well with ada belt and cardigan. until straps altered will keep cardigan on.very comfortable and cute- lots of compliments worn to work",pos
This top was a great purchase even though it's a bit expensive. love the colors and the fit.,pos
"I am so pleased with this midi dress; i've already worn and laundered this dress multiple times and i cannot express how comfortable and cute this dress is to wear. best of all, the fabric is just substantial enough that there are no posterior lumps or panty lines that are visible and the v-neck is just low enough to provide a subtle sexy dã©colletage. i love the length of this dress as i really dislike my knobby knees and this exposes enough leg from the sides and disguises the ugly knees for me",pos
This is so pretty and 60s like. i tried on a return size 2 and it really fit. i am usually a zero so i was surprised. the regular size fit me really well. length was perfect. pretty heavy and substantial though. love the 3 d effect. 115 lbs. 30 dd. 26.5 in waist,pos
"Look carefully at the pics of the back. if this style and the color suit you, just go ahead and order this one. it looks just like the pics, and is light, comfortable and true to size. the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great. however, because the back is sheer from halfway down, maybe not for work if you work in an office. moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easy-peasy. i am 5'3"", 34c/28/38 and ordered the regular s.",pos
I absolutely love each this dress! it is shimmery as others have said but the design looks so beautiful that way and i don't agree that it mages it look cheap. love the neckline and the length is perfect unless you're a petite size. i would snatch this one right up if it weren't for the price point. i'm hoping it'll go to sale but it's so beautiful it might be sold out by then . the fabric seems delicate like he threads could come apart easily.,pos

I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.,pos

the quality is bad. i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived, new in the packages, with one having a small hole. the knit is so thin, as is the base material. the arms are basically see-through. it doesn't offer any warmth because of the thinness. i layered a long-sleeved white tee underneath which helped. the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour. i also had two area",neg
"This is such a fun pullover sweater! i'm not much for sweaters, so i thought this would be a neat alternative. im between a small and medium, so i went with the small due to the swing style. it fit wonderfully! i'm even happy with the length which completely covers my behind (i'm 5'6""). i choose the gray and it's a great neutral, but now i'm contemplating going back for the red as well! hopefully a promo will come along soon!",pos

"I like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel, or just for everyday, i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces. i am not a fan of 'dry clean only' items, so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find. this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily, it is a tad boxy, but it actually works for me (5'4, 34c, 125 lbs) i can wear it with a c",pos
Unless you have the body of the model - tall and very thin and wear a really small size - don't even think about getting this dress! it's literally a heavy sack. it hit right above my knee in the front and basically mid-calf in the back. the material is nice but it's an awful shape!,neg

"I'm not sure why it's considered a ""blue motif,"" i think it's more on the black and cream side. other than that this is a great silk top for warmer weather, it's lightweight and airy and you'll probably want to wear a nude bra underneath. looks great with jeans and heels for a fun night out as well as trousers for work. i'm 5'7"" and almost 130 lbs with a 34a bust and a small fit great.",pos
This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that it's not going to work. too boxy. too short. and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an over-sized child's shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine.,neg

"Cool color, great feel to this sweater. nice with jeans, skirts, etc. very cozy to wear. i just want to keep grabbing it every morning.",pos
"I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning.",neg
I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.,pos
"I am busty and have a difficult time wearing stripes because they are not that flattering. the stripes on this top are narrow, and the material is thin which makes this great to wear under a jacket if you want to dress it up. i am 5 feet tall and ordered both the regular small and the ps because i wasn't sure which sleeves would be best on me (as far as the length goes.) if you want the sleeves to look like they do on the model order the petite if that's what you usually order. you can also get",pos

This skirt is really beautiful and well made. the color is a cream/off white like other reviewers mentioned. it fits mostly true to size--i have a straight build with a wider stomach and no hips and my usual 4 fit a tad tight in the waist but perfect in the hips. i just love this skirt.,pos
"These corodorys are considered mid waist but i interpret them as the perfect height for the low waist or regular rise. other than that, they are beautiful so comfortable not stretchey yet not constricting. i'm 5'6"" 107lb got a size 25 and i need a belt in the waist but the butt and legs are perfect and the waist isn't too big just not constricting. i always get urban outfitter corodorys but this year their quality is bad and these made of up it 100% plus the length is perfect",pos
"These are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style. they look best rolled up for that casual, chic look and can be dressed up or down. these do run slightly large. i'm 5""1 and 102- 104 pounds and took the 24 petite size. i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out. love these and really recommend them!",pos
The malabar moto vest is made of a beautifully soft fabric and is lined on the inside. the added details - pockets and epaulets - are a plus. the vest has snaps and a zipper. the length is just right and the vest has a flattering shape.,pos
These are as comfortable as any other leggings. they are thick enough that they are not see through (such a pet peeve when i see people with see through leggings). the front panel is so soft and i feel like it gives more of a professional vibe. they are a bit cropped/short but i'm tall so i'm used to this.,pos
"I bought the blue/green color. it was absolutely beautiful...i paired it with a green sweater jacket for inside and took the sweater off as it warmed up. very comfortable, versatile, flexible and the color is rich. i am 5'5 and 147 pds and the m fit perfect.",pos
"When i walked into the store, this tee instantly caught my eye. it's light weight, not too low cut and longer in the back. great with jeans, skirts or shorts.",pos
Love this top!,pos
"Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!), and worse, the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread, which showed through the sheer netting layer on top. 

for the price, this particular detail should have been addressed.",neg
I feel like an indian goddess in this dress! lots of swing to it!,pos
"I purchased this on sale. it exceeded my expectations. it is extremely soft and had a very unique construction and details. i love it. it does shed a bit, but that does not bother me as the sweater is stunning! ordered my typical size small. no camisole is needed if worn with a nude bra.",pos
"I picked this up during the bf promo and very happy to find my size 10. i was watching this coat, i call this really a topper, because it is not heavy and finishes an outfit, i went up to a size 10 because it runs slim as noted in the description and the reviews. i find this piece to be a reminder of the old retailer pieces i have collected over the years ( since 2001!) my chest is a 34dd and even then the 10 is snug. i can't wait to wear this bold statement piece, i purchased the bailly 44 navy p",pos
"I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size, i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.",pos
"This dress got my attention in the store due to the bright color. it's like a tangerine orange that absolutely shouts summer. loved the asymmetrical hem and another plus was the pockets! they look completely hidden so the dress does fall flat. i thought this ran a little big in the chest area, which doesn't happen often. a size 8 worked for me, can't wait to wear this!",pos

"I chose the petite small for the shorter length & fits perfectly. it falls abt 3"" below my knees. normally i am a small in tops. waiting for some cooler weather to wear with some of my swing style turtlenecks i have & jeans. 5'3"", 115#, 3c. looks pretty much on me as in the pic.",pos
"This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal, but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit, the shirt is very beautiful in every way.",neg
Very cute and comfortable dress. run true to size. i usually wear a 4 and the s fits nicely. stretchy and soft!,pos
"I used to walk by this dress, thinking not much of it. but one day i realized it had a bow which im a complete sucker for. tried it on. fell in love. tried on the 4 and 6 - went with the 4, runs tts. if the dress is too large, the bow flips down and you can see too much gaping between your back and the dress. somewhere between a shift and a sheath is this silhouette. with my hair pinned up in a teased out japanese bun and great black heels, my valentine date fell for this dress too. he said it r",pos
I love the colorblock color combo. the colors are neutral enough to go with so many things yet still be unique and stand out. the fit was perfect. i took my normal size medium.,pos
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit wonderfully. i bought the blouse in black, but will also probably purchase it in the cream. the blouse is made very nicely, however i had to deal with about 6 embroidered pieces that were not knotted. i had to take a needle, and thread the loose pieces to the back of the blouse and then knot them in with the rest of the embroidery. some of the individual flowers just came out entirely. however, this is such a stunning blouse and i feel so g",pos
This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless. it was not flattering at all on my shape. i don't think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest.,neg
"This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it. however, it is seriously overpriced. i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through. the small was even a bit roomy (5'7"", 140lbs, 32dd). going back unfortunately.",neg
"Like other reviewers, found leg more flared/straight than pictured. i wore all day at work (desk job) and didn't see any wrinkling.",pos
"I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.",pos
I was surprised i was the 1st to review this t- i got it on black friday & loved the fit and look immediately! i wear w skinny jeans and boots but also converse or ... many options and a good price!,pos
"I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate. i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses. i knew to size up based on reviews here. i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top. the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body. i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top, with gaping armholes. too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable.",neg
This sweater has a retro feel to it. i like how it hits right at the hips and it's not too long or not too short. it keeps you warm and it's a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter.,pos
"Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days, while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.",pos
"I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i just love it! i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and i ordered the petite small. i may even been able to get away with petite xs. i did not find this top too full, long or tentlike at all. i have a bust as well and it looks very flattering on me. i wore it with denim shorts and it will look great with skinny jeans. i would also wear it on the beach as a cover up. very versatile. i love the color and pattern on the top and really love the black lace on the bottom",pos
"I was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter. this shirt looks great on its own, but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests, etc. it's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality, but it is holding up well so far.",pos
I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.,pos
"Nice quality, not too thin like most white tops and the arms are cut just right. perfect length too.",pos
"I ordered the xx petite on this one, and unlike last year's version of a similar sweater, this one is a bit longer and looser. last year, i kept the xs p, but it was shorter too. the fit is loose, not snug or form-fitting, even as the smallest size available, it was loose but not large or unflattering. the length was also appropriate. love the colors, and pattern too. the material is soft, and the button detail in the back is fun. i am 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs, for reference.",pos
"Love this t-shirt, its comfortable and very cute. it runs a little large i am 5'0 110 pounds and got a xs. 
the color is a little brighter than the picture.",pos
"The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.",neg
"This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun, comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8"" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees, i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great!",pos
"I just received these in the mail, but had to send them back to the store because they are too big. i usually wear a 28 and sometimes even a 29 in most ag and mother jeans. the 28 in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture. i ordered size 27, so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute. the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown.",pos
"I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b), but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is, and certainly lovely.",pos
"I... love... this dress. the fit is incredibly flattering (and i'm currently carrying more weight than my normal size). i selected a 6, which is about a size larger than normal, and it was a perfect fit. i tried on a larger size for measure, and the 6 provided a (perfect) fit and flare. i've worn the dress on three occasions, already, and each time friends remarked on their admiration for the dress, itself and flattering style for me, i have no issues, at all, with the cut, and to me, the bias a",pos
I love the tiger print. its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit.,pos
"I like this top. it provides a nice pop to the fall/winter dark wardrobe pieces. the picture gives off a blue hue, but the top is black, kind of a dusty black. the picture also gives the impression that the leaves are turquoise, but they're actually more green. at any rate, it is nice addition to my very dark winter wardrobe. i cannot wait to wear it with white denim like the model and something in the green family. i definitely recommend it.",pos
"The pictures of this dress are terrible compared to seeing it in person, and i instantly fell in love with this dress when i put it on.  the fit is very flattering with a touch of 1920s flare. the colors are better in person too, with the lightest color being pink, not white as pictured.",pos
"This dress is lovely. the embroidery is beautifully done and with bright colors. the material is sturdy. the fit is overall true to size but slightly small through the bust. the length is several inches above my knees and i ordered the 6 regular even though i am only 5'4"". the pockets are a bonus!",pos
I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.,pos
The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.,pos
Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,neg
"I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped. 
it is very pretty but once on, it fit the wrong way. i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust. 
the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line. sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless. the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high.",neg
"Dress is silk? it's soft and pretty. it's blue so you can wear brown or blue suede boots!
i caught my reflection a few times and thought i looked really bottom heavy. dress is awesome. worth it.",pos
"I saw the neutral motif in the ""there's only one left"" hanger in the store and tried it on. it's very pretty, cute and sweet. i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a baby-doll look, but that's just my preference. i tried on size 2 and it's a bit tight in the chest area (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), so i think size 4 would fit very well. despite the pretty flower design, in my personal opinion, i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric.",pos
This dress has style and a delicate balance between design and the beauty of the material.,pos
"This sweater is so much better in person. it is a heavy, soft knit that fits perfectly.i am petite and thin and took the reg xs. it is very flattering and drops just below the hips. the bottom is a bit flowy. i bought the beige and bright pink color. the pink is very dark and bright and has an orangy tint to it. i wear a dark beige cami underneath. super cute with cuffed dark jeans and black booties.",pos
This top is gorgeous and versatile. i wear it with jeans and dress it up with a skirt. so happy to have this in my wardrobe.,pos
"Again, nope. looks chic on the model, looked like a floor-length flannel nightgown on me. if you'd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand, i could double for ebenezer scrooge in ""a christmas carol."" i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was ""shmata"" (yiddish for ""rags). it looked like i was wearing a rag. the ruching didn't do anything to flatter my figure, the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater (felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe",neg

"If i could tell you how many compliments i got on with this coat, i would end up writing a book. this coat is beautiful, fits like a glove. i got the size 4, went into the store to try it on to make sure it fit right and tried on both the 4 and 6. i'm typically a 2, so i guess i went a size up. this coat is striking and the colors are beautiful.",pos
"I ordered this because i can&#39;t resist denim shirts.  i love the unusual shape for a tank top and the full-length, bronze zipper in the back is to die for.  it looks great with everything!",pos
I was worried at first that this dress might make me look like a circus tent but it is actually incredibly flattering. also super comfy! first day wearing if i got compliments from friends and strangers!,pos

This dress is very comfortable. the fabric is really nice and the dress flows when you move. classic and pretty. i ordered a xs and i'm 5'3 135lbs 34b and the fit was great.,pos
Wore with leggings & ballet flats ??compliments!,pos

"The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate. but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used. although figure flattering, the zipper is so cheap that --it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress. and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they're asking for it. maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail",neg
"Pretty design, but when i tried it on, the fabric was thin and delicate. i don't think it would last long with much wear. too bad. if the fabric were sturdier, it'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets.",neg
"This is such a darling velvet dress. understated, yet eye catching, i am very fond of it. the cut is flattering to all and the gathered fabric does not add bulk to the waist. there is a fun tulle underskirt to give just the right amount of volume. the straps creep ever so slightly toward being off shoulder, but fear not because there are loops and fasteners to hold your bra in place.

i am very thrilled to have found my holiday party dress so early and can't wait to wear it!",pos

These look nothing like the picture! they are super high-waisted & longer than they look in this picture. i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the 90's that just fit terribly. i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs & they are far from it. the color was also much lighter than shown in picture. super unflattering & just not for me. they're going back...,neg
This dress is awesome - i actually first saw it on lucy lui on elementary and thought it had to be from retailer. sure enough it was and it was on sale. i got the blue and would have gotten both if they had my size. i am usually a m and found this fit true to size. i always love a wrap dress and this with the buttons keeps it from spilling open - love it!,pos

I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...,neg

"This dress is really sweet and flows well. i love the fabric, and the colors are soft. this dress is perfect for hot summ days and is so comfortable. you could dress it up with fun sandals or simple wear flip flops. i love how the seam around the bodice drops lower in the back, it's very flattering. i bought a small.",pos
"This is a great piece, it fits really well and the fabric is nice and soft. it is a good thickness so you don't have to wear a shirt underneath.",pos
"This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra, and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps, a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense), and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage, this bra has it all. so comfy too.",pos
"The shirt fits very nicely, a little large but very confortable. amazing color (i got it in green)",pos
"This sweater has instantly become a favorite. it is incredibly soft, the detailing is delicate and feminine, and the fit is cozy and flattering. the body has a definitive swing cut while the arms are slim - though not tight. i find the loose body, slim arm combination to be very flattering and forgiving. run out and buy this now if you love anywhere where it gets cold, foggy or dark -- it's a guaranteed go-to!",pos
I purchased this sweater in black to dress up my everyday cardigan. this is very soft and can dress up a skirt or great with jeans.,pos
"This shirt is beautiful.its very light weight and great summer tee. don't hesitate to buy this, you won't be disappointed.i usually don't buy t-shirts that are quite this pricey, but i knew it might not last till it went on sale.runs a bit large and since it is linen, it will likely stretch a bit.(i have not worn it yet)",pos
"This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back, and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9"" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough, so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer, and the embroidered dots are well done.",pos
"The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!",pos
"My 16 year-old daughter fell in love with this when we saw it in the store at the beginning of the summer, but it was much, much too expensive. when i saw it on sale at the end of the summer, i jumped on it. she loves it.",pos
"I'm in love with this top! i usually wear a s/m or 6, and the size 6 fits perfectly. the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down (and when they're down they hit right at the wrist, not too long or short). it's lightweight and comfy, but looks really pulled together. i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer. a great transitional piece.

i only wish this came in solid white (o",pos
"Another reviewer said it best, ""i love the way this dress makes me feel."" i couldn't agree more. the lines are perfect and effortless. 
with all the different reviews on size, i went into the store to try it on. i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly. i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress. i am 5' 5"", 130, and have a small bust.",pos
"I love this sweater - i've gotten compliments on it every time i've worn it! i have the moth color and it is oh so cozy, yet not too big or too heavy. i pair it with black leggings, black booties and a crimson-colored scarf. it's nice as it can be great for day-to-evening. getting the other two colors asap! the medium fits me perfectly.",pos
"I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm 5 feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 34  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little ""stiffness"" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!",pos
"Beautiful print, however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer, much sheerer than the product shot shows. i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami, however my nude bra was completely visible.
the top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans, so much shorter than the tunic length shown, and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person (the top half of the sleeves are slim, and the bottom half are looser).

"I tried this dress on in store, and i realized it is true to size in every way. i am 5'1 and needed a petite for it to land just above my knee. this dress was elegant- i wore it to a wedding and some thought it was a ""rent the runway"" dress! ha! i'm way to classy for that. for all you ladies who want to look sophisticated in those cooler evening events, this is your dress! i felt so elegant and danced the night away and had no issues! the clasps go all the way down the dress, so i do suggest (li",pos

Wore it to an interview. the color is fantastic. it's beautiful and artsy. highly recommend!,pos
"I absolutely love this blouse. it is so soft, easy to wear and can be worn with so many things. i'm 5'3, 135 pounds and got a small (regular). i could've gone for the petite but decided to do regular. love it!",pos
"This jacket is a show stopper.  great fabric, beautiful embroidery.  well worth the price.",pos
This dress was exactly what i wanted. great material. cute pale blue slip lining the dress. i ordered a medium and it was perfect. i am about 5'6 and about 145. i received compliments all day on how cute it was,pos
"Just recently purchased and think it's ok for the price. would never pay full on this one & that's from an retailer shopper who's purchased plenty at full price. design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color, so-so on construction - the bottom seams pucker slightly, the pockets bunch up weirdly (steaming/laundering don't help) & the shoulders also hunch up oddly. could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didn't help that issue either.",neg
"This robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year. i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model. usually things look better on the models, but not this one. i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes (thank you, retailer!). this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly, without being too heavy. the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice. i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed.",pos
"This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7"" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s",pos
"I never noticed this sweater online but when i saw it in the store, it was love at first sight. i agree with other reviewers that the color description is odd. the brown is a very pale gray and the blue is a light mint green. the sweater is very delicate looking and fits true to size. the sleeves are very long, covering my hands, and i have long arms. it does have enough body to make a large roll at the cuff. i do have a couple of issues that aren't related specifically to this sweater: even tho",pos
I waited a long time to get this top. unfortunately i will be returning. the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides. not as pictured. the sides should have been pleated. it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug. afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing. the design is unique and wish this top would of worked.,neg
"I love these jeans. the fabric is super, super soft with good stretch and give, however they don't loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference, i am 5'4"" and wear size 25. comfy, go-to's.",pos
"The red of the cape is a deep garnet. really pretty with the beige lining. it's loose enough that it feels and flows differently than a sweater. the boiled wool isn't itchy but keeps you warm on a fall day. the one snap lets you easily take it on and off. i'm 5'5"" and 125lbs. the xs fit perfectly without being too tight. i've gotten a lot of compliments on it.",pos
"Let me start by saying i am incredibly picky about pants. i hate probably 99% of the pants i try on. pilcro is the consistent exception, and these are probably my favorites of all my pilcros (perhaps tied with the cords). runs true to pilcro size, which i find to be a bit large--most of my other pants are a 30, and a 29 is quite comfortable in these. despite being leggings, they're thick/structured enough to wear to work.",pos
The arm holes are a little large but not to a point i can not deal with them! it hits just at the right place on my body and is very flattering. i love the print and it is going to be a staple with jackets and alone!!,pos
"Great fit, runs maybe a tad big but overall great fit/quality.",pos
"I bought 2 in the store.  i usually order large petite but i was in the store which doesn't have petites, so i tried a large, and it was tight in the bust, but i loved the shape.  i ended up buying xl's and taking them up at the shoulders to make it a petite fit.  gives me a small looking waistline.",pos
"I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i'm 5'4, 125..i ordered a small, it's a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra.",pos
"Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well, it really did not lay right on me. i'm a 34d, and i got my usual size in a small. the arm holes were a bit too big, the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me.",neg
"I thought this dress would make me look washed out, but absolutely doesn't--beautiful pop of color, and unique design. i've received many complements, this one is a keeper.",pos
"I absolutely love this top! it is soft, comfortable and perfectly flowy. this is definitely my favorite go to casual summer top.",pos
"This could worn with anything. tank top, long sleeves, gloves, jeans and pants. very high quality material. will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall!!!",pos
"I really wanted to love this shirt! the colors are gorgeous, very vibrant and just as shown. the fit was all wrong on me. i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy. and, it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck. it looked like a sack on me. for reference- i am 5'2"", 112lbs...with a small frame.",neg
I loved this dress as pictured online and when i received it i fell in love with the look as well as the fit. it is such a perfect dress for the day or night. i am so happy i ordered it.,pos
Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.,pos
"I love this sweater, i bought the grey and the neutral one. it is very soft, has great color combos and seems to have minimal pulling. even though it's lightweight, it keeps me warm.",pos
"This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.",pos
"Just bought this top in the black at my local retailer and i love it. it fits well, not too large and ""tenty"". it actually fit me under the arms, too. usually, retailer tops tend to run huge, not this one. i love that it is easy to layer with a long boyfriend cardi or a more structured jacket. i'm 5'3"" 110 pounds and took the xs. i would definitely recommend this top!",pos
"This is a beautifully made jacket. i ended up buying the cream color as the yellow had sold out. the cream goes with everything, so that was probably the right decision. the inside of the jacket has a silk lining with a scotty dog pattern. the jacket fabric has just the right weight to hang properly, without being too heavy.",pos
Love this poncho - plan to take it to europe this fall. warm and cozy yet not constricting. great neutral color!,pos
"I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!",pos
"I thought these were pretty on the website, but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds, pinks, greens, blues, yellow -- with flora, fauna, houses, writing, type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft, medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets, though!",pos
"The fabric is too sheer, also looks like sleepwear. just not my thing.",neg
"This was a rare full-price purchase for me. i do think that it runs slightly large, but that is part of the ""look"" of this dress. i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist, but they didn't have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s. i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering, but i also think it will transition well with tights, boots, and a cardigan when temps start cooling off.",pos
This is my favorite kind of neckline. it is very flattering & cool for summer. my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low. but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it. its super cute. will be great for vacationing & next summer.,pos
"I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model, but it was a cropped length on me :(",neg
"I've been wanting to try the cropped pleated pants style and i like these. the material is nice & comfortable and the bow adds whimsy. compared to other brands i've tried, these pants fit the best. the waistband goes up higher in the back so there's no gapping (a big plus for me). just one thing, i find cartonnier to run small so i would suggest ordering one size bigger.",pos
This top is gorgeous! this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing. i just love how unique this top is. it's a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves. i'm a 34ddd i ordered the large and it's perfect. it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways.  it's a must buy!,pos
This is a pretty tunic but it just didn't look right on me. the colors are nice and you can easily hide body flaws.,pos
"The quality of this sweater is excellent. it is well work the money. i am 34d 5'4"" and purchased a medium. fits perfectly for a fitted look and hits right at my natural waistline.",pos
"Love! boys and arrows make amazing suits! i wear a 25/26 in jeans and a size small in this bikini bottom - it actually fits true to size, which seems impossible in swimwear! cheeky for sure, but so cute! fabric is super, super soft. i want to wear these all day long.",pos
"I fell in love with this top in the store and ordered another online. it is very soft and comfortable. the petite tend to run a little short in the front, but the regular is perfect. it's oversized without being frumpy or boxy on my petite frame.",pos
Absolutely love everything about this dress!!! i'm 5'9 138lbs purchased a small. hits just slightly above the knee... has a fun flow to it! absolutely love the chest detail! cute buttons! and the embroidered detail is amazing!,pos
"Love, love, love this dress! the color is a beautiful blue grey, and the peach embroidery has just a tiny bit of sparkle. can be dressed up or down.",pos
When i got this skirt i figured it was a muted sweater skirt. what i got was a much fancier sparkly sweater skirt. the blue is more of a bright sparkly teal and gold thread is woven throughout. oh my it's spectacular. really beautiful.,pos
"I liked the understated colors of this dress, so i decided to try it on. i did not expect it to fit so well! i'm 5'3"" with a large bust and large hips. the dress was super slimming and flattering, it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me. the only thing i'd have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long, but i'm used to that with my height. the straps are positioned perfectly, my bra straps didn't even show. the material is very thin and light.",pos
"I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe, and just like all other pilcro jeans, they are a great fit and true to size.",pos
"This is a beautiful blouse. great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back. will look great with white skinny jeans. it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works. i waffled between the 6 and 8 (am usually an 8 and a full b cup).  in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast, so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf",pos
"I saw this in the rockefeller store and picked it right up. i don't wear red so this shade or burgundy was more my color. the fit is perfect (sometimes buy a m at retailer but the small was perfect, which is what i'd wear at in most brands). i was slightly shocked it cost more than the other tops i bought, but it was too pretty to put back. wore with dark flare jeans to dinner that very night!",pos
"Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1, 119#, 32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store, and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes, or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage, but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro",pos
"This is a simple, light-weight tunic top. the construction is fine. overall, i'm happy to see a basic executed well.",pos
I purchased this top in the oatmeal/beige color. i love it. the material is very soft and it fits true to size. i would have purchased the black color too if it was still available.,pos
Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.,neg
Ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick. love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick.,pos
This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress. it is not ivory. it is sortof a blush color???? not at all what i had in mind. the sweater itself is pretty. the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it. definite return. :(,neg
I live abroad where there is no retailer. so i  rely heavily on reviews.i took the advice from others and ordered a size up.  glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small. if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you. luckily for me..it fits wonderfully..i love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets. it's lined..but not too bulky.its a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin.,pos
"I bought this on sale and at the sale price it is a steal. great style, feel, and fit. maybe wouldn't feel as good about it at full price, but wish i had one is every color!",pos
"Great top! super cute. runs a little big, i usually purchase l but the m fit better. it's thin, but not see through, so it lays well.",pos
"I find these to be nearly perfect. the quality is idea--soft, yet sturdy. the stitching is unique based on the color--which i love. and while they're super machine-washable, i never need to iron them for a business-casual look. i tend to like things on the baggy side, so as a 5'7"" gal with about 120 pounds on me, i wear a 28, but i'm sure a fitted look would be more appealing to most. that said, i often get larger because they're a tiny bit shorter than i like, so i wear them kinda low. and if i",pos
"It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while, i wasn't sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer.",pos
"I bought this dress in a sm for a cruise i'm taking soon. i don't have much of a waist, kind of straight like a board, and this dress is very flattering on my figure. the skirt fits snug and the top drapes nicely over my waist. very pretty and flowy. i bought the multi color stripe dress and the vertical stripes enhance the beauty of the dress.",pos
"I loved this but hesitated to order since i'm petite and busty and assumed it would be an awful mess in the chest area (too tight, gaping etc) but it is great!!! it fits perfectly! there is plenty of room in the chest and the dress is not too long! i ordered a pm and its wonderful. the dress is not see through at all. love it!!!!!",pos
"This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach, and very lovely. as you can see from the photos, the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress, but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green, which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person, which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li",pos
"I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great. this dress does not meet those standards. on the 2nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke. i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress, i'm dissapointed.",neg
"I saw this online and loved it, then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i couldn't resist. the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i didn't think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular s/m but it was super comfortable and very stylish. it wasn't too big or too small, it fit me just right without any awkwardness.",pos
"Love the color, ordered the plum. it is very nice in person, not quite as burgundy, more purple-y... i don't typically go for the plain dresses, as i feel at the price, it should be a statement, but i don

wearable as casual or dressed up
solid plain color
soft fabric
long sleeves, yet sexy enough without being too much
flirty (it is on the shorter side)

"I love these t.la tees, and i buy them often. i find them to be very versatile and super soft. i have several colors and they hold up well if you wash and hang dry. i am a small in most retailer tops and these are no exception. they wear well under jean jackets or even a long-sleeve button-down shirt.",pos
"Very pretty and comfortable. it was not obvious at my store that this was to go with swim suits. it was located next to regular pants, but once i tried it on - i realized it was somewhat see through. i still got it as its very lovely. i'm going on a beach vacation, so i know i'll use it over bathing suits. honestly i may use it with nude underwear or long shirts anyway, since its so different and pretty. i bought a large as i'm a 10-12 and its still pretty loose.",pos

I love this dress which for me will double as tunic over leggings/tights. the fabric is very comfortable for fall into winter for southern california and looks super cute with booties or boots. this will be a mainstay of my wardrobe.,pos
"I ordered this tank, and was very pleased with the quality. each of the stripe colors has a different knit, adding an unusual and interesting look. it has a trim fit. i wear s and sometimes xs, but this fit perfectly in the s. i agree with the other reviewers that that armholes are the correct size- so nice not to worry about a bra showing in the armholes!",pos

"Love this skirt. i wore it to work after purchasing this, and i had at least 20+ people comment on how beautiful it is. many office ladies asked where i purchased it and one (who asked the cost) said it was worth the steep price. the green in this skirt really pops out, as do the gorgeous golden flowers. the pockets are a nice addition as well.",pos
"I love the look of this dress but it runs very large. i am 5'2 110lbs. i ordered the extra small on sale & got a killer deal on it. i intended to use it as a beach cover up since it's sheer, but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu. even for the price & for the beach i am going to return it. i'm sad because it is a beautiful cover-up and for what it is i think the quality is good.",neg
"I have been looking for leather or faux leather pants for a while, and these look great. they are more expensive than other faux leather pants, but the quality is much higher. i'm glad i didn't buy the cheap ""leather look"" pants i keep seeing. the only caveat is that they do run small, like the other reviewers said. i am a 27 pretty consistently in this brand, but i got the 28. they fit perfectly. because of the material on the back, they do not lose their shape, either. highly recommended.",pos
"This is cuter in person, more of a brown than a cream like in the picture. it runs a little smaller than i was expecting, but that's actually good for me as things usually are a little loose up top. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 32c, and an xs fit well for a sexier look, but if you're wanting it a little looser, i would go up one size.",pos
"After reading all reviews, i didn?t know what to expect, but i really loved the design so i ordered it any way. how positively surprised i was! this dress has a structure. the fit is great, just right in all places. the length hits right at the knee. i was afraid it would be too heavy for a denim dress, but it is actually thin and soft, not hot at all. for better understanding of the fit, i am 5?7?, 144 lb. and 34c. i?m between s and m in tops because of my wide shoulders, but size 8 in this dre",pos

This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love. the style and quality are amazing. it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line. it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting. i am saying goodbye to vs forever. i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazing.it is sexy and classic at the same time.,pos

Lately retailer tees have been misses for me but i was intrigued by the reviewers comments about the shaping of the tee to enhance the illusion of a waistline. that drew me in because i have a short waist and some shaped tees just cling there and emphasize rolls more than my waist. but not this one. it is more fitted along the back waist and looser in the front. i generally order size large in tees as i did with this one. i don't think the fit is too big because it's cut not to cling anywhere. i h,pos

I purchased the blue & white pattern of this shirt. the color blue was bright and contrasted perfectly with the white color in the square design. this shirt worn with a white pair of slacks or a white skirt makes a perfect presentation for any occassion during the warm spring and summer months. the fit of the shirt was true to size. i love the longer length of this shirt because it elongates one's height. the cuffed sleeves are perfect in length. the classic style of this shirt guarantees many y,pos

Just not cute. i don't know how else to describe this top. i am a 34dd and ordered a large. it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am. i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasn't in store so i returned.,neg

"I am 6'2"" and athletically built, and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me, but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length. it is very flattering. the weight of the dress allows it to move with you. it is form-fitting, but loose at the same time, so your body doesn't look lost in the material. you can dress it up with heels, or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual.",pos
"This jacket is so great! i've gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket. this one wins! the color is nice and saturated. the fabric is soft and drapey so it's still flattering to my shape. it's slightly relaxed and i think it creates an ""easy"" look. i've already worn this with a dress, and it will finish off many other looks in my closet! yea! i'm 5'6"", 138 lbs and took a medium.",pos

"I bought a petite medium and the length was right, but it fit like a potato sack. it was quite comfortable, and didn't look completely terrible from the front, but from the side, it was terribly unflattering. when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie. i don't do form-fitting clothing, but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way. it's got to go back.",neg
"This sweater jacket is beautiful!  i wasn't going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy, but i am so glad i did.  it's super soft and looks great with jeans and a t-shirt.  i have a petite frame, and it doesn't look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do.  totally recommend this one!",pos

"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb, 5'-4"", 36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern, color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent, lol. also, the back is slightly longer than the front, something i couldnt see from the pictures online.",neg
"I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online, i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.",neg

Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und,pos
"I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o",pos
"These are my favorite jeans. the fabric is soft but has a good amount of weight to them. all the details reflect a high quality jean. i usually have a very hard time finding jeans that fit my backside and thighs well without a huge gap at the waist. these sit lower on my hips, no gap, and plenty of space for my butt. they do run a bit large though. i have a 29"" natural waist and think a 28 would have been even more perfect.",pos
"I love this dress. i purchased a size down from my normal dress size after reading the reviews. i'm 5'9"" 148lbs 34dd and the size 6 fit perfect. the attached slip is a tad darker than my  very fair skin color but it still works. can't wait to dress it up with some nice heels.",pos
This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.,pos

"I saw this dress on the girl working the fitting room at my local store. she had it knotted in the front with some cute cognac sandals. i immediately fell in love! i tried on the xs, my normal size, and it fit like a dream. so comfortable!! it was a little pricey so i held off but couldn't stop thinking about it. i went back the next day, caved & purchased. it's one of my favorite dresses for summer now. i love this brand so i wasn't surprised!",pos
Caught a sale in oct and purchased the gray. beautiful light gray. i am normally a med or lg and the small in this sweater was perfect. i am larger in the bust so it is not boxy on me. added a delicate pin to the shoulder and it was darling for our casual christmas dinner.,pos
I usually pass on ruffles but this top is great! luckily i walked by this in the store and had to try it on. the material is very soft and can easily be converted from work to a night out. the v-neck is flattering and the ruffles lay nicely- i purchased this in the taupe but the green is beautiful too and will purchase it as well.,pos
This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!,pos
"I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy, thin, and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back, it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup.",neg
"I have been eyeing this dress for months and finally, a sale. the pattern is beautiful and is a great quality. the fit:
it is a swing dress, so if you are a bigger girl, this may not be flattering; try a belt though. the high neck could be a bother for some-it does fit close to the neck, but not tight.
also, size down...two sizes. i do usually a medium and i went with a petite small.

"Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat. i got a size small, (120, 5'6) felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth. very unflattering. another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottom?.adding to the overall bad look. i had it on for about 20 seconds and put it back in the bag to return. din't have to ponder about it at all.",neg
"Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself, but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!",pos
"Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3"") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!",pos

i love the pleated neckline! i feel like an old hollywood beauty in this dress. great one retailer!",pos
This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much,neg
"I'd seen this in the store pre-sale and was delighted to see it on sale. i'm 5'4"", 125 lbs and prefer a looser fit, so went with the medium, as i expect that it may shrink a bit. but i appreciated the creative take on a classic look, good quality of the fabric, and this will go with everything in the summer. or even beforehand -- with a cardigan.",pos
"I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.",pos
"So happy to say this dress was built for my body type.  i'm heavier & wider in my upper body so the cut of the bodice/halter fits perfectly and comfortably.  going in at the waist and flaring out to a soft a-line, the skirt pleating lays just right since i have no hips or booty.  yes, the fabric is heavier weight, so i wouldn't recommend wearing in hot & humid weather.  i love the unique print & colors!  i do not own anything in this color combination.  the retro vibe is strong in this one so i",pos

"Runs big, but the fabric is nice and comfortable. i had to return first order and order the next size up. it is short in the front but a nice length in the back. it will be a great dress for fall and the color is unique, more brownish orange than red. it will look great with boots!",pos

"Super cute dress online on the model. what you can't tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight. it might be my body type. otherwise, it's super cute in person and i wish it would've fit better!",neg
The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.,pos
"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.

i ordered the small, and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy, with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on.

"I am not really a ""print person"" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser, which they do every season, is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching, buttons, pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are.
i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well",pos
I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.,neg
"I was returning something to the store. before i stepped out of the store when this skirt caught my eyes. it's such a nice skirt, with the gorgeous red color, beautiful buttons and material that is heavy and thick but soft. i paired it with a white shirt that is currently on sale and fell in love with both matching together. it is tts, i'm 5'5 and 120lb and i usually get 0-2 in size. size 0 was sold out in the store so i tried size 2 and it fits me very well. the length is great, it falls 2-3 in",pos
"Love this top! i'm 5'7, 145 pounds, athletic build, and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut, so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment, but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back, as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality, and i would order this in more colors if it were available!",pos
"This dress is great if you're very skinny and have no chest. otherwise, it makes you look dowdy. the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexion.

this one is going back.",neg
"I love this top. the seam does go across the bustling but if you are small chested like me...it is perfect. very bohemian and an almost classic look with a very contemporary twist. there are splits up the side that show off a great pair of leggings. i wore this today with some lysee black and grey patterned leggings, a long grey camisole, and some cute short free people booties...i may have gotten 20 compliments. love it.",pos
These leggings are awesome quality especially for the price. they are warm and form fitting. they are thick and the design is nice. i plan on wearing them all winter!,pos

"Well, i wanted to love it and it was just too much. i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be. i also feel it should be fully lined. it was not. the exterior wool and pattern is very nice. maybe if it was lined, a smaller size would have worked better, but for the price, i needed more. i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up. i realize this isn't in the picture, so no expectation, but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines",neg

"This didn't work for me. it looks better unzipped. the piece made me look extremely top heavy, and i am by no means overweight, but i do have a larger chest on a small frame (36c, 5 feet, 115). honestly, it just made me look fat. the design is cute, but this is going back..",neg

"This dress is perfect for anyone with an hour glass shape,it is true to size, i am 5'3 and 125b the 2 petite fit perfectly. the fabric has a little give to it so if you have hips and a chest it will stretch a little without feeling tight and dress sinches in the waist creating a beautiful silhouette. it's the structure of this dress that makes it elegant and sexy. this dress is so figure flattering, i could not believe how many complements i've received on it.",pos
Love this dress.  the color is beautiful.  runs large so size down,pos
"Love this top! tried it on in store...so glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium. the color is a beautiful camel and the material is soft...very grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool, lol! therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wear...the price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i don't mind spending the extra $!",pos

"I'm 5'5, 145lbs and i'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor. i bought this shirt in a red, medium and love it. yes, it's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it's meant to be a bit big. i've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it. this shirt washes well per instructions, didn't shrink or loose it's shape and i've washed it three times now. i've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is, love",pos
"When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print. i was so disappointed when it came. the print is not centered in the front or the back. it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry. for this price the detail of centering the design was expected, especially because this is how it appeared in the picture. loved the blouse, but i will be returning it becau",neg

"I am really happy with these jeans. fun fit, high waisted, great detail, and have just the right amount of stretch. i have worn them 4 times and haven't washed them yet (i find this helps shape my new jeans) and they still fit like a comfortable glove. a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color! love them! i normally fit a 29, ordered 28 in these and they are perfect!",pos

i'm 5'10"", 155# and pear-shaped.

the length was absolutely perfect, it wasn't scratchy in the least. i got compliments on the dress all day long. wore with a pair of cowboy boots while wine tasting in napa.",pos
"Such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit! it is so, so boxy - i'm thin, but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right (and i don't mean making it super tight). the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately. so, i had to return this, despite really wanting to find a way to make it work.",neg
"Love these pants. love the fit. i can't wait to wear them, but i have to find the time to hem them first. i am kinda tall at 5'9"" and i wear a lot of heels, even tall heels. but these pants are even too long for my 3-4"" heels, and i don't wear taller than that to work every day. only on very rare occasions. so they do need to be hemmed. they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer. good fabric and a nice fit!",pos
"I ordered this in xs and s. they both fit very well and i couldn't tell much difference between the two. i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it. i am 5'4"" about 120#. i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns (the taupe and white stripe...hint hint hint) too. it's just perfect. i am in my mid 40s and have young kids so it's great for my life right now! comfortable too!",pos

Beautiful summer top and so versatile! it's definitely worth it.,pos

This shirt makes me feel stylish without trying! i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying! it is comfortable and fits true to size. it is flattering at the bottom without too much width/peplum.,pos
Great spring colors that you really can wear just about any time of year with the right foot wear! the fabric is a fluid jersey that drapes well. the neck line is a substantial scoop which is very flattering. i am very happy with this online purchase!,pos
"This is a beautiful dress, but the fit was strange. i have a small waist and larger hips. i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style, but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips. even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half.

I decided to order both the black & sand colors in the m/l. very soft & fit is perfect. has adjustable straps. wore under my racerback tank today for my usual walk. the bra & straps were not exposed. it did not rub or irritate at all. it will work well under other tops i have & some dresses that are racerback style. i have other racerback bras but they just haven't worked out - either too uncomfortable or the straps show anyways. this one is perfect! it's soft & lightweight. it has some moderate,pos

The shirt brings back the '60s look of appliquã©d patches on shirts. it is a quality piece with a bit of humor. the length is shorter than usual for chambray shirts but also very comfortable . it could be left open as a light jacket over tees and tanks. fabric feels good on skin.,pos

the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7"", 125 lb, got size s). also, i wish the lining was full, not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...

overall, i like it :))",pos
I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i don't always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes,pos

"I am 5'6"", 130 lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small. these were really baggy in the thigh/quadricep area and made my thighs look bulky. the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types. my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed.",neg
"This shirt is so great! i fell in love with it once i saw the back. if you're looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz, this is it. i have wide hips, and this tank if great because it's a little boxy without making me look huge. it's excellent quality, and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer!",pos
"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway, i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs, 5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft, nad looks like it may not wrinkles, which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute, but you can't really wear this untied, so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)",pos
This is the best! i have the black and striped version and wear them weekly. great layering piece and also for fitting so they look great with skinny jeans. i love the snaps. i saw this at full price but waited for the sale so that i could get more than one!!! now i just need the gray one...,pos
"Love this top!
it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.
i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.
love both colors, and having fun wearing them.
and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.
runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.
if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size",pos
"Listen up gals - buy every color before they disappear!!! this top is amazing. so flattering, incredible fabric, the colors are divine and the price is amazing! i am not one who wears peplum tops often if ever. a coworker of mine spotted this one in our store and told me as soon as i came in. i'm curvy - generally a l or xl on top and i have hips and a toosh. peplums can often either sit on my hips in an unflattering way, or look like a maternity top on me. this one is magic. hits a big longer,",pos
"Really like this shirt. easy to throw on with jeans (black if you don't like the denim on denim). flattering without making you look boxy. arms are roomy too, unlike the what the picture shows.",pos
"I've been waiting for this to go on sale, and just picked one up in store. the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint! since it's billowy in nature, a size smaller fits me perfectly.",pos

"What an adorable, classic style fringed top this is! i recently purchased this in my regular size but i should've read the reviews first and ordered a size up. when i went up from a size 6 to an 8 (34d-27-35), it fit me perfectly and looks so cute on! i think this one feels well made and i love the little details of the beads and how the fringe is placed. it looks very flapper girl;) i bought this on sale in the pink color and cannot wait until spring and summer to wear with jeans or a skirt!",pos
"Love this top! it has a beautiful appliquã© that is reminiscent of many past retailer favorites. it's comfy, yet cute and fashionable.",pos
"Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!",pos
"I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately, however, i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.

the quality seemed okay, but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.",neg
These shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size 8 or 29. i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and i'm not sure if they will shrink at all so i'm keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.,pos
"This gorgeous dress is what retailer is all about. natural fibers like silk and rayon and cotton, unusual beautiful prints and colors, not your average day to day find. i bought this in my usual size l, and while i could use a bit more room in the top, it works either unbuttoned one button, which shows the beautiful turquoise slip that comes with it, or, i am going to stitch it down the front so the buttons won't open and the top won't gap at the bust. i am 5'5"" and the dress is a perfect l",pos

"I'm a teacher and am always looking for easy to wear pieces that will also work for my job. i also walk in to campus with my backpack, so i need something that looks good but is comfortable. 
this dress drapes beautifully, is really soft, and has a wide, flattering neckline. i'm short and chose the regular size instead of petite so that it would hit right at the knee. it's definitely on the generous side: i usually wear an s and i sized down to an xs.
i can definitely see getting a lot of wear",pos
"Beautiful dress! beautiful color and design. as the other reviewer says, it has an expose good quality gold color zipper on the back that doesn't show in the picture, however, it adds to its style and beauty! i love the dress and so happy that found it in my size finally!",pos
"I am 5'8"" 135 lbs, broad shoulders and normal waste to hip ratio. this jumper fits beautifully and material flows just enough to be forgiving but flattering. love love love, definitely happy with myself for the splurge. can't wait to wear it out!!!",pos
"I can't say enough about this pant! the fit is perfect, enough shape to hold you in but not so tight you think you're wearing leggings. this is my go to business casual. can't wait to get another color, my store had this in black",pos
"I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful, the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35"" long, and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy, but it was really, really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider.",neg
"I ordered this top from store. i'm 5'3"" and 114 lbs, i ordered size 4, fir very nice, just front is little to low for me, but i wear ten top , it will be fine. the style and material are amazing, love it!",pos
"I find that every year (or two at the most) i have to find a new favorite black dress or two (fading, etc.), and, this is definitely one of those dresses for this year (almost one to buy another, so i have one that looks good in a year or two)! the dress is all around flattering and comfortable... looks wonderful with high heels and flats, looks good at work and while out having fun! probably won't be able to count how many times i wear it this year!",pos
So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.,neg
"I had never tried on a romper or jumper. the print of this changed my mind and i'm glad for it. it looks amazing on is easy to wear. i kind of wish it were lined but it's probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer. 

i did end up using double stick take bc the front was so low but it was worth it.",pos
Looks great on. i am 5'11 and the length is perfect hits above the knee but not too short. also room in the chest area.,pos
"Love this! so colorful and cute! will look great with shorts this summer, and will keep me cool in the city in the summer heat. thanks retailer!",pos
I wish they would have shown this belted as it is beyond striking if you slip you belt thru the top of the slit.under the fabric and bring thru the front belting only the front leaving the back full...stunning and chic! because of the colors this will be incredible in the fall...i plan to wear with all my on trend overalls and booties...madly in love with it. i am certain if all these 1 star reviwes played with it in the fashion they too would have given 5 stars. the knit is beautiful and again,pos
"Sometimes ""swing"" styles don't work on me - i'm on the busty side so they often make me look like i'm wearing a tent from a side view. not so this sweater. it's more of an a-line shape than a ""swing"" style and is very flattering - i would think on all body types. i love that it zips up and has pockets. the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling. super soft too - not an itch in sight!!

Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;),pos
"Fantastic quality. i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices. the fit is tts. i am smaller on top than the bottom and size 2 fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material, 32-24-36. i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design. i couldn't tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit. i rea",pos
"My preference is clothing made of natural fibers, but i couldn't resist trying this on once i felt it! the cut-out pattern in the fabric, the color,  the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i'm going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night. it's perfect for southern california fall (& likely much of winter this year) weather. i'm a 32d (& won't need/wear a bra) & although i usually wear a 6, i bought a 4. maeve, i like your style!",pos
"This over-sized sweater is light-weight and scratchy. i knew it would fit big, but the neck is overly bulky. the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture. fits a little larger (on me) than on the model. i'm petite so it overwhelmed me.",neg
"I own quite a few deletta tops, and this one nails it. a great staple in a pretty color (i purchased the green). peplum tops can be hit or miss for me and often come up short or balloon out too much. this one is so flattering. i initially ordered a medium (5'8"", 145) but exchanged for a small when i found the medium to be a little roomy on me. the small is perfect. the top is made of a medium weight material and is slightly fitted, nipping in at the waist. the ""skirt"" piece falls nicely and is l",pos
"I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl. both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses. everything the first reviewer wrote is true. the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain (like the blue). the back is just a solid, kind of slippery material. it's strange because it's not see-through in the back but you need to wear a tank/cami for the front. so, it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer.

"And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous. i think how it fits depends alot on body type. the material is nice, color pretty, not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine.....",neg
"Well, the model looks great and i really like interesting unusual designs as it can be really unique for very long time. i tried and when i opened package it was funny looking tent with several beautiful buttons. fits like tent, long, huge, make me look like i am on military trials and i supposed to be some sort of target.",neg
I just love this hoodie! it is so soft and comfortable. i am usually an extra small and that size fit me great. i wish it didn't have the brand on the back of it but i can get over that. this is a very cozy piece that i will wear many times.,pos
"Love these! i'm a big fan of ag stevie jeans and these are no exception. the mid rise is terrific and the distressing is cute without being crazy. i like how the holes are not at the knees, which can be annoying when bending your legs. i would love to see these offered in a darker rinse and also in a cropped length. fit is perfect on these - fun and flattering! keep the stevies coming retailer!",pos
"Just bought this cardigan today. i'm already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. it's soft, has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long, but it's not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.",pos
"This is a throw it on and you're cute.  so easy and comfy, requires barely any styling to look cute in this.  and it has pockets!",pos
This product runs either really small or is super high waisted. either way not for me.,neg
This is a nice flowy dress that i plan to wear in the fall with long boots. i love how light it feels.,pos
"I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful and saturated, the fit is spot-on and so flattering. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"", 170# 34f bra and 40-41"" hips. i love this brand!",pos
"I bought this dress in the navy stripe version and love it. the material is so soft it's like wearing pajamas, and the actual swing skirt is flattering (which surprised me when i tried it on). i wore it to work with burgundy heels and got a lot of compliments from my co-workers. i'm 5'9"", 130 lbs and the xs worked best for me.",pos
"Adorable summer top. the geometrical shape makes this top interesting. it looks much better on then in the picture displayed. it's soft , flowing and covers all flaws. the gold color is beautiful and vibrant. i know i will purchase this in other colors. the long back really sets it off. if you are looking for comfort, don't hesitate, this top is perfect.",pos
"Exciting design, beautiful fabric. love this dress",pos
"Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!",neg
This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews,pos

Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.,neg
It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.,neg
This top is sold out in my size online but i was fortunate enough to snag one in the store. great top that can be dressed up or down. the ruching across the front is very slimming. tried the top with skirts and pants -- looks great with everything! i usually wear a size small in deletta tops but sized up to a medium to accommodate my chest (i am a full c cup). i highly recommend this purchase.,pos
"Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts, maybe even a bit large, but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind, i have a rather large bust, so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note, there are no closures in the front of the jacket, but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.",pos
"Lovely sweater, good quality fabric, pretty color. 
as the reviewer say, it is very thick wool pile, if warm is not what you're looking for, you may want to think twice.",pos
"I bought 2 pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time! these chinos are great for my figure. i like to think of myself as a ""diamond"" shape ;) large chest, moderate waist, large hips, and small legs. these pants fit so great!!! i bought my regular size and don't have to take in the legs! the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who aren't 20 or 30-something any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy! i'm not a teeny woman either",pos
"My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i can't take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it's very versatile.",pos
"Love this top and will be wearing it for our fall family pics this weekend! it is lovely, soft and flattering.",pos
I really like this dress. it has a very flattering cut and a stretchy forgiving fit so you could go your normal size or up a size and both would fit great. i got the red (orange) and i have worn it once and got 3 compliments in the few hours i was out.  great buy! especially on sale ;),pos
"This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning, i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this!",pos
"I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me. i'm usually fine with the petite sizing, but this didn't work and i'm so bummed. the dress is soft, the blue color is gorgeous, but it fits like a bag. i wanted to love this, but sadly will have to return. i think someone with curves will love this dress. it is really beautiful quality, just does not fit a petite frame.",neg
"I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u",pos
"When you order online, you can't always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get. like the other reviewers, i found this piece to be beautiful and well made. it's made from rayon and not sheer. the coral, cream, green, and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric. this piece is meant to be swingy and loose. however, i started with a large but exchanged for a medium. it still feels a little loose so if you're undecided about sizes, order down.",pos
"I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first, the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono, which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve, no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu",neg
Everything that pilcro makes for pants fit me great! i am not skinny but these pants fit me in a way that you can't see my belly. i love when pilcro goes on sale because they are a great quality and getting their stuff on sale is a bonus.,pos
These trousers are wonderful. the fabric is comfortable and does have a little give to it.,pos
This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.,pos
"I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference, i'm 5'4, 130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small.",pos
"This dress is soft, comfortable, beautiful and drapes so nicely - not tent-like at all. i wasn't sure about sizing, and went with some reviewers who recommended sizing down, but the small in the strap/underarm area so i am exchanging for my usual medium. as another reviewer noted, you cannot adjust the straps, they are stitched together not tied together. i considered having it altered but was assured there are plenty in stock. i cannot wait for it to arrive! perfect for summer, or fall with a c",pos
"I'm 5'7 and 137 pounds and i tried on this dress in the store. i got the small as it has a little more material in the medium and the small fits like a glove. this dress is great quality and feels good, looks good and can be dressed up or down. like the model in the picture i like the flats with this dress. high quality fashion and total comfort on a hot summer day. go anywhere with this dress and you look like a million dollars. one more little hidden detail it has a detachable slip underneath",pos
"I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good. it is a good weight for spring, summer and fall. i love that it is a natural cotton/linen blend. the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it, also! i know i won't be disappointed. beautiful sweater with great details.",pos
"I purchased these in taupe, mint, and coral. they are extremely comfortable and soft. they can be rolled up to 3 different lengths. i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great. i can see why they sell out so quickly. a must for summer season.",pos
This dress is really beautiful in person. it comes with a spaghetti strap clingy cotton slip underneath. it runs at least 2 sizes large. i tried my usual size 6 and needed to go down to a zero.,pos
"Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full $128 they are asking, i would be a tad skewed. not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling. doesn't itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer. i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again. big loser.",neg
"I love the style of this jacket! 
i will be curious to see how it holds up in the rain.
it's very well made and has cute details.
it does run large.",pos
This is a great little top. the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts. the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching. i received several compliments when i wore it.,pos
The green color is beautiful. i love the cut and material - it feels luxurious. definitely needs ironing before wear but is a must have,pos
"Beautifully made, well constructed and kangaroo pouch gives it character. turtleneck is very low, sweater is very appealing. great buy, especially when on sale.",pos
"After reading the reviews, i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasn't flattering on me. 
i'm 5'4"", 126 pounds and generally wear a size small, but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me. it squeezed the bust a bit too much, and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering.",neg
"This is a richly detailed top that i bought to go with some nice skirts. the length hits right at the waist so it won't overlap a special skirt at the waist and create extra bulk. it is lined with a flesh colored mesh layer in the white color (you can see this layer in the photos but i wasn't sure if it was part of the piece or a camisole the model was wearing). however, it is still somewhat transparent so you would want to wear it with a flesh-colored bra or cami. overall, i am very happy with",pos
"Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s",pos

Always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability. this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some. it's slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look. find myself wearing it a lot.,pos
"The price was worth the splurge, free shipping and a special discount helped. the minute i laid my eyes on this sweater i was hooked. light, airy weight and that handmade texture make the overall design something special. this is the kind of sweater that has enduring style. the big kangaroo pockets scared me a little, which i have determined to be not a distraction after trying it on.",pos

"I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco",neg
"This top looked so cute in the picture, but unfortunately doesn't live up to it! the one i received, actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt. it makes it much darker, and boring. the shirt itself is on the short side, and would've looked better if it hit lower on the hips, there's just too much fabric for it to land higher than that.",neg
"I bought this dress for a dinner after my daughter's wedding rehearsal. it is perfect. it is dressy enough for the occasion. it also has a casual look to it. i think it is very versatile. i fell in love with the colors, material and the quality. i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding. buy it you'll love it.",pos

"This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i'm an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it's a nice stylish jacket, but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn't look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though.",pos
Added this dress to my summer wardrobe in the rust color. it's a very relaxed dress. easy to throw on. as others have suggested in going to add a belt to this to add a little more flair. but i love this designer. but it does run large. sizing down helps immensely.,pos
"The print, colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely. the design is quirky to say the least. i ordered a small, as i usually do. i am 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket. it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist. it's not flattering at all.",neg
The model looks like she's 14 years old - this sweater of course would fit a younger teen. it definitely won't work for a grown woman. please make some longer sweaters.,neg

Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-),pos
"I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27"" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey, which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!",pos
"Found this cute little black sweater on the sale rack in a small and it fit perfect. it is flattering and will look great over a tank top or strappy dress. the little details of chiffon around the collar and the tiny cutout holes around the back, the softness, and the little detail on the back bottom make this a perfect go to sweater for me. i only say it runs small because it is a cropped style so expect it to be short, but i would agree that the arms are more to the snug side than the loose fi",pos

"I ordered a size small. i am 5'7"" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high, so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft, thick, stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back.",neg
"I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style, it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist, just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d, 135#, 38-28-35.",pos
I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.,neg
"I ordered this skirt in my usual xs. when it arrived it looked tiny. the xs was almost impossible to get on. i ended up returning the xs for a medium, which fit perfectly (and is work appropriate). my measurements are 5'6"" and 125. my recommendation would size up two sizes.",pos
"This was my first shot at high-rise bottoms and i love them. the fit is very flattering and the print is adorable. i just bought the bottoms so i can't comment on the top, it looked a bit small for my bust so i am purchasing a solid colored top to match.",pos
I'm glad i got this skirt because it's prettier in person than in the picture. fiance loves it so that's a bonus. it's tts although it's longer than shown on the picture. very high quality and looks expensive. i'm very happy with this purchase.,pos
Looked really cute on line. arrived with a large hole in the front! quality and look was very cheap!!! would not recommend this sweater at all. step it up please retailer!,neg
This is a perfect sweater to dress up or dress down. very comfortable and stylish. i love the slits on the side. works great with skinny jeans or leggings.,pos
"I love the colors on this dress, very nice on a pale skin. i ahd this in my wish list for so long, and it finally went on sale. i ordered it and was very pleased. only drawback is the collar was a little irritating (but i am ok with it). it fits like a glove (o), i didn't think it would as there are no petites, but that worked for me, the lace pattern is classy. and the hem is totally fun. great purchase (maybe petite would not have bothered my neck).

"Fully lined until just above the knee, silk exterior, rayon lining. can dress it up or down. very lightweight and cool-feeling. this is a beautiful dress. i'm 5'9 and it fit great-- shorter people might need to alter it. i tried it on in the store and felt like a princess, but am hoping it goes on sale.",pos
"This dress is beautiful! it is a nice, heavy fabric with stretch and just fits perfectly.",pos
"I'm upset. i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper, the picture of the grey does not have a zipper. i prefer no zipper, so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper, i was disappointed. it's going back. why have a model where an item that you're not offering???",neg
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful sweater! being that it's a wool blend, i thought it would be itchy against my skin. to my surprise, it is quite the opposite. very cozy and soft, with plenty of ""wiggle room"". i'm very tall and having enough length for my arms is always a concern. the sleeves are long and comfortable. this sweater is quickly becoming one of my new favorite ""go to"" pieces!",pos
"I'm 5'10"", 140lbs and this dress fits exactly like shown on the model. hits right above my knees in front and an inch or so below my knees in the back. i didn't find it to be too blousey at all. i'm more pear shaped so i like that this is flowey around my hips and bum. purchased a size 6 and it fits well over my chest and arms. if you're busty or have muscular arms i can see how this might feel more restrictive. great staple to my wardrobe!",pos
"I am always on the hunt for jeans and regularly buy paige - these jeans are different than the regular paige styles, in all the best ways. they are made with super soft denim that is comfortable and very flattering; the waist is high, so my tush doesn't hang out when i sit - i love them. i am 5'8"" and 140lbs and these are long. i can only wear them with heels, but i was looking for a dress up jean and these are it!",pos
"Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8"" and athletic.",pos
Beautiful colors,pos
"I love this sweater! i ordered the dark gray and wasn't expecting fabulous but that's what i got. the skirt below the waist tie is actually pleated so that it falls perfectly. the seaming detail is beautiful. i am between a size large and extra large and the extra large fit perfectly. the sweater is short, half way down my hips but looks good over a long tank. this a medium weight knit and will be wearable all year with skirts, dresses and any kind of trousers. this is one of my favorite purchas",pos
Cute everyday shorts. run tts to maybe just slightly small. not too short for this mid 30s mom.,pos
"This dress was adorable & fit great! regrettably, i had to return it since it wasn't lined.",neg
"These jeans are so great, i'm thinking of getting a second pair for when the first wear out, despite the price. they hug my curves and make me feel like a bombshell. the fabric and stitching is all good quality and sturdy - these are comfy but they definitely are not thin like legging jeans. love them!",pos
"I fell in love with this top when i first saw it on the retailer website and was pleasantly surprised when it was every bit as beautiful in person as it was online (even more so). the bronze colored threads are to die for and the fit is perfect on my 5'4"" (129 lb) 34c frame. if your on the fence on this one, get it. it's worth the purchase!",pos
"I totally love this tank! the yoke detailing is so pretty! i read the other reviews...i feel it fits pretty tts, it's what i expected. i have already worn it several times since it arrived in the mail. i love it so much, i'm ordering it in the turquoise color as well. every time i have worn it, i have received compliments. i've worn it alone with shorts and/or jeans, as well as with a cardigan and dress pants for work. it's soft, comfortable and to echo what another review stated, the material s",pos
"As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!",pos
"The design and quality are fantastic!
i had to order a little larger because of my bust and shoulders - it's still flattering though. can be dressed up or casual. i wish it came in more colors!",pos
"Got this style in both black and green. the fabric is soft and the neck design is very elegant! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",pos
"Beautiful dress, just like wearing a night shirt!!  great flattering fit for most figures!! wonderful color love the bell sleeves.",pos
This cream sweater is a great addition to your wardrobe. the length hits below the waist and the zipper adds an updated touch to the look. is a bit itchy but there's room for a light layer underneath.,pos
"Got this in medium (5'6', 36c, 120 lbs.). many of retailer tops i'm a small but this was a good fit for the m. got the white. not really see through but need to cut the side tag out as it shows through. i'm not sure about the other reviews - this was totally not boxy on me - falls very nicely and drapes slightly. a really sweet but simple tee shirt to wear in the summer. you can wear this dressed up with heels, stacked sandals or just with flats - ballet or strappy sandals. looks great with rolled",pos
"I joked with my husband that if i were with the resistance  (star wars), this is what i would wear! i actually really like it. it will look best with a girly skirt and blouse. the quilting is lightweight and the fit is slim. well made too.",pos
"I have seen this dress for a while and was holding off, but then i decided to try it on (the regualar) size in store to keep in mind for my next binge :-).

the cut is flattering, length is jsut above my knee so i would not get the petite on this one. i would, as others have mentioend, wear it with a belt. overall it fits like a nice comfy t-shirt with comfy skirt, but as a dress, very nice.",pos
"An adorable tank...wearing it right now!
fits this curvy girl well, though may consider wearing a tank underneath, as the keyhole does show a bit of cleavage.
if in between sizes, consider sizing down.
perfect print for summer.",pos
This is a really cute shirt for spring. i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down. have not worn it yet -- waiting for it to get a little warmer.,pos
"Ordered this top in navy with white irregular dots since it was not available in smaller sizes in the store. i took a chance and ordered an xs and the size and fit are perfect! love the scalloped edge, small side slits and the crocheted detail on the top. great addition to my florida wardrobe!",pos
"So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it's rare to find something that's simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs, and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn't have that slit, because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if",pos
"Love this skirt! it's definitely on the tight side, but is a stretchy material. i'm between a 6 and an 8 and went with the six because i liked the way it hugged my curves. as an hourglass shape i sometimes have problems finding pencil skirts - they either fit in the hips and are big at the waitband or the other way around. this one fit great throughout, and was both slimming in the front and flattering in the back. i was also worried that if i tucked anything into this skirt there would be weird",pos
"This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size, i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i can't wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! don't wait too long before this one sells out.",pos
"I don't understand the negative reviews on this dress. i absolutely love the fit, may be the prior reviewer was trying a size on that was too large? yes, the fabric and the snaps are very delicate so you have to be careful putting it on and off, but the fit is very flattering on most people. i saw three different people trying it on in the fitting room today so i decided to try it on myself and had to have it! the colors are beautiful and the uneven hem makes it more fun and young. i will wear i",pos
"This dress is one of my recent faves from retailer. the fit is great. i'm 5'8"" and 145. i ordered the small and it's perfect.",pos
"It's definitely not a $100  blouse, but i took advantage of the sale on sale and gotta say i love it! it's slightly sheer, but with a plain nude bra it's fine. beautiful details, very retro, light and breezy. wearing it to work and with jeans.",pos
"I purchased this in white my normal size being a 2, a size 4 fit better on me. i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals, so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color. 

would definitely recommend.",pos
"This is a really nice suit. it fits well and is slimming with the cross waist. it's also supportive in the bust even, and maybe especially, because it doesn't have moulded cups or underwire, which allows for flexible sizing. the back rises high enough that it supports around the chest as well as from the halter straps. the straps are wide too so they don't dig in and are comfortable. the look is subtle and feminine in the black and the quality is good. it is true to size, but might run a tad lar",pos
"For the price, you can't beat this dress. i love the thicker stretchy fabric used for it - if you're a fan of some of the popular maeve pencil skirts (like the tearoom pencil skirt), you will love this! for me, it's the perfect piece for work with a black or white cardi or denim jacket over it. it's a perfect length (above the knee on 5""7""...similar to the model), armholes are the right size, and the overall cut of the dress is forgiving and flattering, even post-baby. super happy with the value",pos
I love the detailed cutouts on the shirt and the liner is finished with a scalloped edging. perfectly cool for the summer time but also stylish and hip.,pos
"Earlier this year i bought a pair of pilcro hyphen's as a birthday gift for a family member, and she absolutely loved them! after hearing from her how comfortable and amazing the pants are, i had to get some for myself! i usually only wear denim pants, everything else is skirts, dresses or shorts. so this was a big change in style for me.so far i love them, they are way more comfy than i had expected and made from great material!
i'm 5' 2'' and 120lbs. they 27s fit perfectly. i do not have slim",pos
This dress is gorgeous. it is a perfect fit and very flattering.,pos
"Was super excited to try this on, but had to go up 3 sizes from my normal 6 and the waist was still too tight - i was swimming in the top as well. just a very strange cut and unflattering. such a bummer because it's so pretty.",neg
"I saw this in my local retailer, and was blown away by how soft it was! the minute i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off. for being a boxy cut, it was surprisingly flattering. i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes, but i could easily zip the size large all the way up. this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend, or with a pretty blouse on under it at work. i know i'll get a ton of use out of it, so i recommend it!",pos
"These pants are amazing and great quality! thank you to the reviewers who suggested sizing up one size. the trousers don't have a lot of stretch and are very cute and well-made and the size up is perfect! i am normally a 2r in most pants and skirts and i sized up to a 4r, they are perfect. gorgeous pattern, and i too, am not a ""pattern""-type. will go perfectly with a number of the solid, flowy maeve tops i have for work.",pos
This dress has become a favorite in my rotation. the cut and print flatter my body and accentuate my waist. the print is subtle enough to pair with bold accessories.,pos
To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down,neg
This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.,neg
This dress was a gamble for a nautical them wedding next year. could not be happier. fabric was surprisingly stretchy which made it move like butter. the dress was stunning on and very comfortable which cannot be said for many gowns. i am so glad i took the gamble.,pos
"I have gotten so many compliments on this top. it does run very large- i'm normally a large, returned for a medium, which is still a bit on the large size. the small was even still large but much shorter so i loved it so much i just took the medium. it's a 'tent' style or 'trapeze' style which doesn't completely show in the images. super nice, thin linen-like cotton and absolutely beautiful. love it!",pos
"I purchased this to wear on the same day. it did have a strong smell ! i tried airing but didn't help much so didn't wear. tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing (by hand, my fault for not checking this part). it is a bit over my price range for a casual top, so hoping i'll end up loving it!",neg
This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.,neg
"I loved the details on the top of the shirt but was especially excited by the length of the top - it comes just over the hips and gives a flattering fit, as well as the sweet little micro sleeves. the color is kind of worn looking but it is so soft. i will definitely wear this a lot. 
 
i bought a medium but probably could've gotten away with a small.",pos
"Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful, but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.",neg
"I received this top in my normal xxsp size and it fits perfect. it's roomy so i'm glad i went with the smallest size. the color states pink but it's really between a red and raspberry so it's better looking than pictured. as with most off the shoulder tops, if you raise your hands it slips up, but it actually looks good that way too and forms a square around the neck that appears like that's the natural design. overall, great value, light and flowy, plus the fabric is a soft linen so it breathes",pos
"True to size, nice unique shoulder/neckline fit and blousey/full on the bottom and arms which taper in. for me, i prefer to wear it tucked or partially tucked in to add waist definition. though a vest or belt can also be used. sheer, you will need a cami. lovely flow and colors., the collar,pleats and neck tie add a romantic interest. just beautiful.",pos
"Haven't seen a top as fun and unique as this without being ""too much"" in a long time. i typically like a little longer with skinny jeans/leggings but this does the job of hitting at a good spot just at my crotch and the bottom of my behind. it's the right amount of swing at the bottom to wear out (not sure i could tuck it in and make it look right as in the photo), the ""bell"" at the sleeve bottoms adds just the right amount of detail as does the neck detail and ties. the color is beautiful and i",pos
"The first time i wore it, felt wonderful. had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling. very disappointed with the price and quality. wish i could return for my money back. sad",neg
"I bought this at my local retailer store. i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying it..uh yeah! this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties. i bought the yellow. its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend. ive received many compliments. the arm holes were small for me, i bought a size 6, normally i'm a small or xs in most tops. i am 5-2, 130 lbs, petite and fit, the 6 regular was perfect for me, i was ok with it a little longer.",pos
"I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful. i opened it, tried it on, sent it back...it is well made but has too many negatives. first, it is very thick. i ordered size 6 (5'2"", 140 lbs.). the size was good, but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen. it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way. finally, and most importantly, it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c",neg
I love this tee. it is light weight and fits perfectly. the additional accents like cuff work and detail around the neck makes it original.,pos
"This vest kept catching my eye online. i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater, (which is fabulous,) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater. the more i looked at these pictures, the more i fell in love with the vest. needless to say, i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts. it's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe!",pos
"Caught my eye at checkout, and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick try-on, which ended up being a great call! the dress is super easy and flattering, as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape. the fabric has a sweet floral texture, and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting. i'm 5'4"" and it came just above the knee in front, while the back was a bit longer (another flattering feature). this is going to be a summer go-to!",pos
This ruffle tee is adorable on. the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure. i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south.,pos
I have this tank in all colors...it is superb for layering...comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline...and it's long enough!,pos
"This romper is fabulous! i bought it in lime, and the color is great and perfect for summer. i do agree with the other reviewers that it's hard to get in and out of the sleeves (hence giving it only 4 starts for quality#, but the struggle is worth it. the fabric is lightweight and silky, so it feels cool and soft; it feels like wearing pjs. it's also very flattering with the bow just at the waist; it hides a not-so-flat tummy. i'm 5'4"", between 135 and 140, and curvy #very busty specifically), a",pos
I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured. so great for a business casual environment. the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe.,pos
"I wasn't sure how this was going to look on me, but it was so darned cute, i had to give it a try. and i love it! i'm 5'4"" around 130lbs and i bought both a small and a medium to try. the medium fit best. the length is perfect. hits just a little bit longer than the model but almost the same. the material is light but nothing see thru about it. it is slimming and looks so cute on! so glad i gave it a try.",pos
"This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!",pos
"Agree with the others. when i saw this jacket in the store i really liked it, and when i tried it on i had to have it! it looks great, drapes beautifully and the color goes with so many things. my first instinct was to size up to a medium to maximize the drape, but it wasn't necessary. runs a tad on the large side.",pos
"The photo does not do this top justice. if you pull the tie a bit, it shapes the blouse a bit. i have a few work tops from retailer that i treasure -- they look good, wear well, wash easily and drip-dry perfectly. this top fits the bill too. and it goes with navy, black or even wine-colored pants. grab one!",pos
"I just purchased this sweater, but have not worn it yet as it is still very hot in the va/dc area. the print is super cute in person. it reminds me of a missoni knit pattern. the color is described as gray motif, but it's really more greens and browns, very fall colors. the sweater is soft and comfortable. the knit is fine, not chunky and doesn't add bulk. it is fitted through the chest with an empire waist and flowing over your stomach and hip area; wonderfully forgiving of any extra bulges you",pos
I love this dress. i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on. i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large. it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt. i would buy it again!!,pos
"This dress is amazing! i bought this dress for my daughter for her college graduation. it fits like a dream. she normally wears a size 2 but i got the 4 which was perfect. with the slightly longer length, it is very professional but with the lace cut outs is great for a party, as well. it is very flattering and well made.",pos
"I'd been eyeing this dress since it first appeared online, but when i went to order, there was no petite sizing. then when shopping, i noticed the carbon color in the petite section of my local retailer. i grabbed my usual ps, and although it was okay, i decided to try the xs for comparison. the slightly closer fit made all the difference, suggesting that i had a figure underneath, but not tight anywhere. nice weight to the fabric, it drapes beautifully and the lacing detail is very popular now. a",pos
"This top runs large. i had no problem sizing down one size, and could have gone down two sizes if not for the bust area. i ordered this tee in the distressed black color (in real life, it's more like distressed charcoal gray), and really like the fit. the asymmetric peplum is unusual, and cut at a flattering angle. i also really like that this top is not short; i often have trouble with length at retailer, being long in the torso. even going down a size, the length is great. overall, i like that t",pos
I get a ton of compliments on this. cute and comfortable. you can't go wrong.,pos
"I ordered a size 4, my usual size in tops is s or xs for looser fitted tops, i prefer a more fitted look. for reference i am 5'4"" 120 lbs,, 32d. i ordered in pink and the color matches the online image. the pink is shear and i do have to wear a camisole underneath, which does not bother me at all. the top is adorable with jeans or slacks for work.",pos
"This top is beautiful.  at the present price, grab it.  the fit was tts for me, a bit loose if anything.  the blue green color, which is not pictured, is shown in my uploaded photos.",pos
"The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material, but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress, which was enormous in my normal size.",neg
"This is one of my favorite retailer dresses - it's flowy and makes me feel beautiful. i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors! it does run big, so i would size down but when you find your size, you'll love it!",pos

"Several months ago i bought the byron lars pieced brocade dress (size 10) it's a little large through the torso area but with the belt it fits good enough. since i have loved this dress so much i wanted another byron lars dress so i bought the carissima sheath and the sunrose dress both in a 10. they both were way too big so i ordered a size 8 and they both just barely fit ??? oh was i disappointed....so one more try, i ordered this dress the allusione sheath size 10, and yepeee it fits perfect",pos
Love this so much! i have received so manu compliments!,pos
This top is so pretty. the fabric is absolutely gorgeous and the lace on the collar and back add an elegant old world vibe to this beautiful blouse. it is very light and flowy and i can imagine it will be nice and cool for those hot summer days to come. i am rather large chested so it does look a little tent like from the side but that is not the case fron the front and honestly i really don't care because it is so comfortable and pretty. i know i will wear this top quite a bit this summer.,pos
"I went back and bought this dress after a sales associate told me that it was super cute on but didn't look like much on the hanger. i'm 5'3"" and curvy and the s fit great. it will look great with boots or booties. it's very comfortable and nice quality material.",pos
This really is a lovely shirt . i like the long length of the sleeves as sleeves are often too short on me to wear cuffed at the wrist. i now have the option of long or rolled up sleeves. the fabric is the perfect weight for indoors. it is definitely a keeper.,pos
"The fabric of this dress is absolutely gorgeous from the design to the colors. i usually wear a size large in most retailer clothing, but i ordered this is l and xl because these dresses tend to disappear fast in the larger sizes. i ended up keeping the xl cause the buttons pulled across the chest on the l. this dress has a slim cut, and i would say if you have a small bust and are slender, this runs true to size. if you have a larger chest, size up because this is the type of dress you want to fl",pos
"I'm so happy i purchased this cardigan!! every time i've worn it i've actually gotten compliments, from both women and men:) i was slightly undecided at first due to it's quite pricey, but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper, not just a quick trend!! i'm so happy i snagged it before it ran out!!\ i have quite muscular upper arms, and the medium fits me well. the sleeves do have some give in them, and even though i'm also broad across my shoul",pos
I bought this top in white. i wore it with black skinny crop jeans. it is very cute and flattering. the length is just so that it makes the swing top flattering without is bring too overwhelming. i received lots of compliments. the quality is great and the top washed up well too. love it. for reference. i'm 5'5' 125 lbs and bought the top in small.,pos
This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat,pos

"Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally, i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love",pos
This structured sweater is beautiful and timeless! gorgeous seasonal color and style is classic! i typically order medium but wanted a more flowy look and got a large. great purchase. great fit!,pos
I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!,pos
"I was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i don't mind :) it's a trend of the season and i absolutely don't mind to look like a mattress or wear robe. the garment runs large so i wear usually 6 and have to get xs. i am 5'6"" 146 lbs usually wear s/m in jackets. it hits me 2 inches below my knee. i love it.",pos

"I cannot speak more highly of these jeans! i am a standard size 2, 5'3"" and have never been able to purchase a pair of jeans and wear them right away. i *always* have to hem them by massive amounts. these jeans are so flattering, the wash is amazing. i have worn them with cute ballet flats and tall boots so far, but i think the possibilities are endless. i am petite but in a curvy way and i haven't felt these great in a pair of jeans in so long. the wash is great for dress up/dress down. i have",pos
So pretty & comfortable! love it!,pos
This maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind! the fabric is very comfortable. the print is very nice. perfect find!,pos
"First of all, mine arrived in a regular denim shade, not the dark wash shown. also, the style is more like a blazer, and it was huge. i am 5'2"" and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer. as well, the sleeves came barely past my wrists, they are designed to cuff as the model has done? perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic! the quality is excellent with some nice details. this might be one to try in person, if you can.",neg
"This is a great ""go to"" top. it isn't too low, too tight, too dressy or too casual. i'm 5'1 and ordered a small petite. it fits perfectly, especially under the arms, (where tops always show my bra) & it doesn't go ""too"" low. i have to admit, i purchased the dusty rose color, i'm not sure how great it complements my olive skin, but i love it anyway.",pos
"Quality, length, size, design are all perfect! i'm sometimes a picky person, but i can't say one thing less about this cardigan. it's all wool, but it feels so soft and comfortable. and it doesn't wrinkle. i put it in my purse for a couple of hours, still great when taken out. thin, but don't you plan to wear something underneath? it goes with everything!",pos
"I love it! the fit is very flattering. i read in another review that the top runs small, so i got a small instead of an extra small and it fits perfectly.",pos
Very flattering dress in a comfortable material. the cut is perfectly placed. this is very long. i'm 5'11 and in flats this touches the floor. easily dressed up or down with the tight accessories.,pos
"This garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it. i am probably between a small and xsmall, but ordered the xsmall. it is snug, but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath, just in case the buttons gap just a little. i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping. it is also a little snug in the elbow area.",pos
"I bought 3 shirts in gold, black and red. they arrived larger than expected. after the first wash and air dry they shrunk. i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide. also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash.",neg
"I got these in the mail today and to me, they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the 80s. they were super comfy but not cute at all on me. they do run large like other reviews say. i am usually an 8/10 or med and these in the small were the right choice. going back because they just look horrible on me though",neg
This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this,pos
"I originally ordered this top in the black and it's been on back order for a month. i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did!  the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso, the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade  pattern. the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail. the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fall/winter. i highly recommend this top for all body types.",pos
"Bought the pink color in the store and just loved the way that they fit me. i ended up ordering the light blue. perfect for a cool summer evening. can be worn with sandals, wedges, or converse sneakers!",pos
"Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small, but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people,",pos
"I absolutely love this bra-it is the most comfortable, aesthetically pleasing sports bra i have ever owned. i love the straps! they take some patience to get aligned properly once the bra is one, but afterward it looks amazing. the bra itself is soft and the padded inserts actually stay in place without much manipulation so they are aligned properly. when moving, i do not have any areas that rub or get irritated uncomfortably. i absolutely love this bra. it gives me the support i need for a high",pos
"My mother, who is not a dress person, ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress, and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile, she decided to try it, and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images, but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully, and looks extremely elegant.",pos
This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!,pos
"Thank you retailer! these really are the perfect black pants. great fit and construction. the material doesn't wrinkle, they slim and shape the body and they are at a good price point. i did have to go up one size but i especially love the elastic in the waistband. my local store almost sold out of these in a day.",pos
Love this tank! it's super soft and has a lovely drape. i got 3 colors on sale and am so glad i did!,pos
"I don't ever do ruffles - i'm a 36ddd - but these laid so nicely and the vertical ruffle is very flattering for a less than flat tummy. the knit back is so soft and makes this easy to wear. it will be easy to dress up with a necklace, blazer and dressy pants but it will go just as nicely on it's on with jeans for a casual look. if there had been the mint color in my size, i would have gotten it too!",pos
"Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue, not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress, however, the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it, but i returned it.",neg
I absolutely love this dress. the quality is perfection. the design is adorable and it is comfortable! i paired it with leggings and short boots and worked 10 hours in it. and i worked a large event so i wansup moving things and active almost the entire time. it was the perfect combination of dressing up for work yet being fully functional! oh and the neck line ads that extra touch of style that makes it a great piece. love this! it is also true to size. i have a medium.,pos
"I love this dress. be warned that even at 5'4"" it is right on the edge of the shortest length that i can get away with wearing. i probably will not wear it to church but for a special event, dinner, or the theater it will be an eye catching statement piece without being over the top. it has a quiet appeal. both layers of fabric are thin but that helps it to conform to my figure without hugging it. it softly drapes showing an hourglass while being extremely comfortable. i think some reviewers int",pos
"I hesitated to buy this after reading the earlier review, but went ahead anyhow, and am glad i did! i ordered the white in a small petite, and it is as cute as can be. it is crisp and true white, not off- white. there is a large pleat on one side of the front to give the blouse some interest, and there are openings on each side which allow the blouse to swing a bit but do not open up to reveal skin. it is not long, but by no means is it cropped. it is really sweet with slim jeans or slim printed",pos
I ordered this in the red stripe material. i love it! it is so soft and easy to wear. i'm wearing it as a bathing suit cover. a nice pink slip is included.,pos
"This is a beautiful tunic dress and the detail makes it so soft and feminine. i would never have bought it online because it looks so plain but in the store today just couldn't believe how pretty. i'm mature so i plan to wear with black leggings and a nice scarf but could easily be worn alone or with jeans. i think it will transition into spring for two season wear. i'm small but large busted (size 6, 32 h bra)and the small was perfect. can't wait to wear it!",pos
"I got compliments the moment i walked into the office with those. they look like leather so much, that i had to ensure some people that only some polyester had to ""die"" so i could wear them ;). i am slim, but i think those pants are cut so well and hang so nicely, they make everybody look slimmer, they are also super soft, very comjfortable and the pockets are big enough to hold my beloved smart phone securely without showing a bulge. the pants look very elegant when paired with the right shoes",pos
"This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on.",neg
Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.,pos
"I saw this online and didn't think twice about it but then i came across it at my local store and it's so much better in person! it is incredibly soft and cozy! i purchased the gray stripe version and two solid color versions (cream/forrest green.) i can see this being a great staple over the fall/winter with leggings, boots and a long pendant.",pos
Love how these fit! they are warm and such a good price! i got 3 pairs. i washed mine in a garment bag and it washed just fine. i hung them dry.,pos
Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.,pos
Super comfy skirt!  can't wait to wear it to football games this season!,pos
"Bought in the store, will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace.  does not fit like it looks on the model, it is more fitted.  i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open.  the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt (not including tassels) reaches the top of my jeans, and the tassels hang below.  it is a very versatile top, one that can be dressed up or down.  sleeves above wrist.",pos
I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.,pos
I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi,pos
"I ordered this online, and when i opened the package, i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top. it is much nicer than a basic t-shirt.

when i tried this on, the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage! also, the overall length is listed as 27"" long, but i think that is the back of the shirt. the front of the shirt is very short on me (i'm 5'10""), hitting well above my hip bones.

if only this was much, m",neg
This skirt is adorable. there is no give to it though. i usually wear a 4/6 and got the 4 and i can't gain a pound or it won't zip. it is perfect for spring and summer. i'm 5'8 135.,pos
Super cute and more fitted than the baggy overalls of yesteryear. i love them.,pos
"I love these pants! they are slimming, can be easily dressed up or down, and they are super soft and comfortable.",pos
"This is one of those ""why we shop at retailer dresses.""

this dress arrived today - via lasership - in an actual box! both deliveries from this service far surpass fedex, ups and certainly usps which crams an expensive item in an unprotected plastic bag into the mailbox!!! okay - off my soapbox and thanks for the free shipping weekend!

"Normally i would never try on anything with horizontal stripes.... but for some reason, i saw it in my store and gave the dress a try. fit is perfect, and dress is lined. (side note: my store had the navy dress and the stripes are horizontal and not diagonal as pictured on the model- dress looks like the ivory dress.) can be dressed up or down, so ill be a great summer go to dress. i am a curvy girl and because of the different widths of the stripes the dress works and is very flattering. i'm ve",pos
"This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover",pos
"I normally take a small or medium in antrho tops, i ordered the xs/s and i'm kind of swimming in it. i think it's a good look though, and will complement shorts or skinny jeans. i could wear this through all seasons in the pnw so i expect to get a lot of use out of it! i was afraid the embroidered shoulders would be stiff and stick out but that isn't the case at all. the sweater is all soft and flowy, drapes nicely, and can be easily dressed up or down. worth the price.",pos
"I didn't have high hopes for these, because things seem to 'ride' on me- but these stay put! and i love the adjustable sides... these are a pretty color, i ordered the raspberry and the silver grey and love both! i normally would not pay a ton for undies, but these are worth every dollar! i have a larger bottom, so purchased the large, but sometimes i can wear medium, so this is great, being adjustable.",pos
"I agree with the other reviews, this top runs large so size down. with that being said, this is a beautiful top, love it!",pos
"Love this poncho! it's casual, has a bit of a sexy vibe, comfy. great with leggings, probably boots once it's a little cooler. soft and lacey, lace is sheer so a cami is needed.",pos
"I love this dress but the top runs very small. i am 5'5, 102 lbs, small frame and the 0 was tight. 0 is my go to size at retailer. i had to return it. i wish i had bought the 2 now.",pos
"Tried this dress on in a s and it fit very nicely.  it's a very unique dress and i loved it, but i just didn't know where i would wear it!",pos
"True, this blazer runs small, so size up! beyond the beautiful depth of color from the herringbone black and dark blue, the stretchy fabric allows for flexibility in what you can wear underneath and for both your bloated and your skinny days. best of all this blazer could be worn 3-4 seasons out if the year and it's got a super-soft lining.",pos
When i saw this i had to have it! i was pleasantly surprised that i was actually able to go down a size (normally a l for the bust) but was able to get into the medium with some room across the chest. it drapes nicely and the inner liner is not tight but flows along with the dress. so many compliments each time i wear it!,pos
"Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that's flattering, feminine & fun.  i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds.  i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small.  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine.  stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top, 6/8 on bottom.",pos
"The color and fit is amazing on this dress. i am 5""7 and went with the small and the length wasn't too short either.",pos
"I love it! i was hesitant to spend so much on a suit, but it's well worth the money. i'm 5'3"", 140 lbs, and my stomach is my biggest problem area. i ordered a size 8 and it's a perfect fit and very flattering.",pos
As soon as i saw this skirt i was in love. i like the fit it is very comfortable. i love the detail in the crocheted part of the skirt. i can't wait to wear it and i recommend this item.,pos
"Love this dress! the stripes are flattering, the material is interesting and it swings! it's feminine and fun!",pos
"This top is so cute. i don't usually like crochet tops, but when i saw this i just had to order it, so glad i did! my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke, but that can be fixed.",pos
"This is a bit pricey, but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price. this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail. the sleeves are upturned and tacked; the curvy hem is very flattering, and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side, just to add to the careful, custom detail. the 60% cotton/40% modal is deliciously soft. the fine detail in cut, fit, artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure",pos
"I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on, but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.",pos
"Beautiful, unique, colors perfect for winter. i received so many compliments at two holiday parties. and on sale, this is a no-brainer",pos
The design and quality were great. i really wanted them to fit but they ran large. i'm 5'4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small. unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i won't be trying a size down. the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward. sadly these went back.,neg
"I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses, and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0, and while i could have gotten away with the 2, there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy, but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference, i'm 109-111 lbs, 5'4, and a 30b. 

when i was finally able to wear the dress, i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!",pos
My daughter had one and wore it with everything.i ended up getting one myself.it is a perfect weight.,pos
"I love the look and feel of the material, but it was way too short - i don't even have a long torso! sadly, it's going back to the store.",neg
I wear a 10/12. i bought a 30/31 and they fit perfect in every way! they were even almost too long so i can wear with heels if i want. i am so glad i bought these. don't let the folded cuff in the picture deceive you. a great pair of straight leg jeans!,pos
This dress is really nice and lightweight. the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely. but..it adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves. it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering. i really wanted to like it because it's so breezy but a tad matronly on me.,neg
This is the perfect jacket to throw on for errands around town. picture doesn't do it justice...very unique and stylish. love the three-quarter sleeves for this time of year.,pos
"I am very petite, however, fuller on top (34ddd). this top looks fabulous! it is cut in such a way that every part of your body looks slimmer. goes with jeans, dress pants of skirt. i highly recommend.",pos
"I know we've gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable, but sometimes it's still that horrible texture, unbreathable mess. unfortunately, that's what this top is made out of. so it runs big, its billowy, and cute, but i couldn't get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric.",neg
I absolutely love this top! i own it in coral and white. it is simply beautiful and the linen fabric makes it comfortable and breathable. i am so happy i bought this top!,pos

"This is a nice sleeveless button down, the bee design is really fun, but the colors make this more stylish than i would have thought. i tried it on with a pair of white shorts, with a half tuck, and it looked great. i can also see it paired with trousers or flared jeans. nice addition. i purchased the 0 (or xs?) my usual size, in regular length, and it was fine. the stylist also showed me how to tied it in the front to wear with high waisted pants. i am 115 lbs for reference and 30 dd.",pos
"This top is gorgeous.  i normally wear s to m depending on brand and style.  ordered a s and it was so small i returned and have l on order.  it is cropped.  i am 5'3"" and it hit me as pictured on model.  if you are tall or like longer tops this may not be for you",pos
The quality of this blouse is great. a bit on the thick side which i like. the fronts a bit shorter than the back. looks great with joggers or jeans. great neckline and design. i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals. love it!,pos
"I am here online to buy this pant in both colors. i tried it on today in store in regular lengh,, but am opting for petite size. i am 5'2. i could have purchased the regular length, which hit me above the ankle, but i think p will be more flattering and better for summer.

the pants are a woven material, and kindof shiny!? the pants also may be a bit see-thru in sunshine due to the structure of weave. that said, i am buying them anyways because they are that comfortable and professional. i may",pos
"A feminine yet mature looking cami. i did not need to wear a bra because the material is thick and stretchy (i am a 34a). it looks great with a pencil skirt as well as chino shorts. feels soft and comfy. can dress it up or down. i took a small and it fit perfectly  (l am 5'4"" 120lbs).",pos
"This dress is extremely comfortable. the dress is slightly loose under the armpits, but the other than that the overall fit is great. can be dressed up or down!",pos
This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!,pos
"I love skorts! so when i saw this online i ordered my usual size 6. arrived today & really cute. fit is good w/ some room to spare. almost too big but i'll stick w/ the 6. looks as in the pic except the lower front part & the back has a metallic sparkly fiber in the fabric. not shown in the pic though. it's understated but attractive. the fabric patches give this skort a special uniqueness. casual or a little dressy, just love... 5'3"", 117#.",pos
"After reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it's on sale, don't hesitate in this purchas",pos
Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.,pos
"I was extremely excited to receive these pants, given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what, but be cautious ordering these pants.",neg
I am 5'3 and tried this dress on in both a large and medium petite. the dress is supposed to be a lose fit but i found that i was swimming in the large but the medium was perfect. i bought it in a petite which is shorter for my comfort to wear alone but looks great with leggings and sandals for spring or with boots in the winter. the embroidery is beautiful plus it has pockets. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.,pos
Love these pants. they look great with a pair of mid calf boots and a loose t-shirt. i usually wear a size 26 or 27 but went with a 27 on these. they are very flattering and edgy. love them!,pos
I love this dress! it is an easy throw on and go dress. the fabric is very soft and the cut is faltering. fit is true to size.,pos
I'm 5 9 with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering.  however this one was perfect! not too short nor long and looks great! highly recommend!!,pos
"I saw this dress on sale online and it was available at my local retailer. i tried it on and went with the xs, i'm 5'4 130lbs, 34c and it fit great with some room. tts the material is fabulous and it comes with a matching green slip which is great.",pos
This is a great top. i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer. i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill. the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous. i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite. i ended up getting the moss and the gray. i could have gotten either the xs or the s. i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper,pos
"I already knew that it's not the lightest summer dress by reading previous reviews.
yes, it is fully lined with stretchy fabric which is kind of thick and heavy for skinny straps. i still love this dress it's very beautiful and versatile. it's perfect for san francisco summer it never gets too hot anyway. 
the color is also beautiful but it's little pink side of red.
i am 5'4 size 0 it fits perfect just like the picture.",pos
"These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by ""by design"".",pos
These pants are a really pretty color and feel nice on. the fit was great and did not really shrink with washing. i received a lot of compliments the first time i wore them.,pos
"I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort. i loved the look of this blue silky piece, and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house. i agree that it is like lounge wear, but for me, there were a few challenges.

first, the fit was small. i am usually anywhere between a 2 and a 6 depending on style, cut and brand. i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel. it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th",neg

"I loved this dress immediately. it is soft to the touch and super comfortable. i will be wearing this so much this summer! the arms are true to size and the body is flowy and roomy, but it is still flattering! highly recommend!",pos
Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo. dress much shorter than shown in photo. shoulder area is tight and really doesn't blend with the material below. this isn't going to work on very many people - pear shape...just not what i've come to expect from retailer.,neg

I love this shirt but it was huge! i ordered a small and i was drowning in it. unfortunately i had to return it.,pos
"At 6' tall, it's hard to find pants that fit my inseam (35"") and these fit the bill. i normally wear a 30 or 31 tall in pants (from brands like ag or paige), but i bought these in a 29 tall as i find pilcro tends to run large. they are soft and comfortable and don't stretch out 3 sizes by the end of the day, which is great. they feel like leggings! the wine color looks just like the images. for those who find measurements helpful, i'm 6' tall, 160lbs with about 42"" hips and a 35"" inseam.",pos
I was looking for a dress to conceal my post baby body but wanted to be able to wear it once i lost the extra weight and this dress does the job! the fit is very flattering and it hangs nicely. great material.,pos

"This swing tee is amazing! i bought the blue one and the color is true to what it looks like online. the material is so soft and cozy. i am typically an xs and bought an xs, however it runs ever so slightly big. if i had purchased the xxs, it seems like the arms would have been to tight and i'm definitely not a fan of that. whatever the case, i highly recommend this tshirt and love its versatility and that i can wear this all year long.",pos

i tried it on and was immediately enthralled. i am 5'10 and the dress flowed like a dream. i will be wearing it for my anniversary celebration with pearls and victorian earrings. i can't wait. it is lovely. you may need to be a little taller than average to wear this but it is wonder",pos
"I'm 5'4 and 125 and the 28 fit comfortably. i initially bought the 27 but felt it was snug in the seat so switched out for the 28, i'm 52 so didn't want the painted on look. they will need to be washed more frequently since they do stretch out as they are worn. love the gray color and goes with so many fall colors.",pos
"As t-shirts go, this one has a flattering fit...shapely waist yet not so tight that unwanted curves show. i bought the striped one in my usual medium and it fits perfect now, so will have to be careful when washing. if it were available, i would have tried the large, so if you're a tad senitive about tight clothes i suggest upsizing. it's a nice weight fabric and the details around the v neck are great....the v dips just like the photo - approprialty sexy and age appropriate (i'm 62, 5'3"" at 125",pos
"I love this dress! it is a very casual and loose fit, which makes it super comfortable. i highly recommend it since it is versatile for fall and spring and can be styled quite a few ways.",pos
"I love these shorts!!! they are thin lightweight and not see through. however the reviews are correct. i am usually a size 2 or 4 in shorts. i am 5'1"" 112 pounds and i had to size up to 6.. i was able to zip the shorts up but the fit wa a little tight. the 6 offered me the comfort of more room.. overall nice shorts..",pos
I bought this recently and it is already a go-to piece in my wardrobe. i love it to dress things up for work. it is extremely comfortable and easy to wear.,pos
I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod. this one didn't work for me. i ordered the medium. the top is very small--i would recommend only for b cup or smaller. the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape. it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter. sending this one back! i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit.,neg
"I had 3 shirts from clearance in my hand but put them back to get this shirt. it's perfect! great with skinnies/sandals for the spring, or boots/leggings for the fall. great for layering and so versatile...i will get more wear out of this than my 3 clearance shirts combined. i like the slit in the side, it makes flowy while also preventing it from looking like a maternity shirt. the only thing i would like is if the shirt was a little less see-through. it's not bad, but i will definitely have to",pos
"I love these! i adore tracy reese, and these are my favorites. they feel like pjs, fit true to size and are just perfect for work (i'm a teacher) or for going casual. very lightweight and not too hot for texas summers.",pos
"I'm barely 5'4"" and rarely find a maxi that isn't far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6"" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length, the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i'm average bust size, always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an",pos
"I bought the first one in the gold color, which i call mustard. i really love the high-low style and looks great when worn with a long necklace(s). when they went on sale, i bought two more, black and grey. i love that they are perfect for layering when it's cold, but that i can also wear them alone, in other seasons. thy ran a bit large for me, so i was able to purchase the small. i am small boned, but large in the bust. i'm also short, 5'2"", but they don't look too long, especially when i wear",pos
I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.,pos
I have always been partial to palazzo pants. these fit like a dream and are very comfortable.,pos
"I love this top-it fits true to size, hits at the low hip so its not too short, and can be worn casually or dressed up. i wore it with ripped ag stevie ankle jeans, freebird by stevie worn brown buckled ankle boots, and a glittery silver necklace, but it would have also looked good with turquoise jewelry. i also plan to pair it with the cabernet-turquoise cecelia prado sparkly skirt, tights and boots, and a jean jacket or black moto jacket. this top would also look amazing with the sanctuary arm",pos
"I wanted this coat from the first moment i saw it in the catalogue. i tend to gravitate toward dark colors, but this looked timeless and beautiful, like something my grandmother would have cherished (and i would have coveted). i was not disappointed. the coat is carefully lined, and the mohair is divinely soft. the silhouette is not fitted, but comes off surprisingly chic. do note that this is not a coat for heavy duty weather; i've even been a bit chilly wearing it at nights in la. also, heed t",pos
I love the cut of this dress. i can see how some would not like the way the arms are cut. i love the pockets and the way this dress flows when you walk it it. it's very fun to wear. i am wearing it to an awards show and was a little worried it may be too casual but the texture and weight of the fabric make it look more dressy. i will be getting a lot of mileage out of this dress.,pos
I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!,pos
"I love the weight of this shirt and the open scoop neck. really flattering ...i wear tanks under my shirts anyway but it is see through. the weight is nice even in heat, and i expect it to be so nice layering in the winter. the cut at the hem is great..... very flattering and does not seem to cling.

i bought a white one, now i have repurchased another white (xs) and a black one. while i was vacillating, theblack xs sold out so i got a small and will cross my fingers that its not too big.",pos
I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....,pos
"I was skeptical when i saw it online. i was not sure about the white background. but it had good reviews and the cut seemed to be what i looked for so i gave it a try and ordered online. i ordered s and xs. i was really surprised how well this dress fits. i am 5.4 and about 126 lbs, pear shape. the fabric is thicker and lined but not too heavy. the cut is slimming, flattering and structured. i decided to keep the xs size. i hope i can find more dresses like this one in retailer.",pos
"Tried this dress on at my local retailer and just fell in love with it. it is a sleek, almost '90's style design that is so comfortable and flattering at the same time. and it has pockets! i will be wearing it all summer with flats or sneakers.",pos
This is a great winter addition to any wardrobe. warm but not hot. looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings. so many compliments.,pos
Bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia. tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look. will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag. they seem breathable and are light weight. super flattering as they are slightly slimming and don't bunch up at the waste. i got the greenish color.,pos
I love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for. it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you don't have one. i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just don't feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms. the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald. love.,pos
I purchased this dress in pink. it is absolutely beautiful. the shimmery detail around the neck is gorgeous! it is so flattering and looks amazing with boots or sandals! this dress will not disappoint!!,pos
"I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned, the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it ""holds"" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it!",pos
"I read the previous reviews, but decided to try it out since retailer was having 40% off sale items.
it looks very flattering on me, and great fit for my body type.
i would recommend.",pos
"I gave this top 5 stars for the embroidery and fit around the chest/shoulders. i wish this top was a little longer as the xsmall was just too short. (i'm 5'6"" and run long-waisted.) the small fit better in length...the way it does on the model.",pos
"What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5""/130lbs and went with the xsp.",pos
"This shirts dresses up anything-tights, jeans or a skirt. love the color and the length",pos
"I love fitted top dresses like this but i find them hard to fit well on my body. this one fit perfectly, straps can be let out or taken in easily, and i get tons of comments on the print!",pos
The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.,neg
"I bought this top in the black motif and it is easily one of my new go to tops. can wear it to brunch, work, and happy hours, it always looks good! such a great buy.",pos
"I love this jumpsuit.

i would like to first say that, while a gorgeous model, i actually think this piece looks even better on different body shapes! 

sizing 
i love the shape, the style, and the comfort. i tried it on in a dressing room where it turns out another woman was trying it as well. i am 5'5"" and usually wear a 4 or 6 and got the small. she was a bit shorter and pettte and it looked fabulous on her! it is loose all over, and so flow and fabulous. it hits me where it hits the mod",pos
As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.,pos
"These jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out, wash in cold, and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they'd still be soft without the dryer/dryer sheets, but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they're very comfortable: i totally love the high rise. they're a little long but i",pos
"This top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model. the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms you're going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out. it's made of a light weight linen-cotton fabric. it's very soft and doesn't wrinkle as easily as most linen does, it feels soft on the skin, light-weight, and has a nice bounce to it. it's",pos
"This shirt is adorable.
but...it didn't work for me!
i'm a smaller gal with a large chest (5'4"", 34g). i tried on the small, since it seemed so flowy and large. the sleeves were tight, yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much, making the shirt look huge on me. perhaps a more fitted back, and i would have been in love.
love the blue color!",neg
"This shirt is really cute. it's shorter than most - and it's supposed to be that way. if you don't want your midriff showing if you stretch - this shirt isn't for you. it has slits on the side also. the material is super light so will be great for summer. i just loved the way it fit and that it's different. i ordered an xs and i'm about 5'5"" and 120 lbs.",pos
"These are incredibly soft and comfortable. they are only for inside lounging, because they are a bit see through and have that long-johns type of material on it.",pos
"I love this top. it is perfect fit. i am 5'3 102lbs, 32 dd. it conforms to your figure.",pos
"Cozy, soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit.",pos
"I am a petite girl, 5'2""/105 lbs- i bought size s and it fits me just right. i love the way the fabric feels on my body. i tried this dress with flat shoe and it doesn't make me look short. the colors are vibrant but not too bright which makes it perfect for any time of the year to wear.",pos
"Love, love, love this dress. it is very slimming. it hugs you without really touching you. leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel.",pos
"I have this color also in the grey - flattering, interesting shirt. i have think hips but a fuller waist, the vertical lines of this shirt design suggest otherwise. great to pair with torn up skinny jeans! love the petite line now in portland.",pos
"I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings, so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived, i was equally pleased to see how soft, cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture, the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!",pos
I love the look on this dress - feels great for a romantic night out or for a party.,pos
"Just got this top and i love it! it's color is more saturated in person, which i like. more of a pinky-purple. very sweet and feminine. i still have a bit of a ""mommy tummy"" and the style hides that pretty well. it's very soft and comfortable as well. overall, happy with this top :)",pos
"This is so pretty for summer. it is very lightweight and flattering on. the color was a little brighter than i expected, but it is still beautiful!",pos
"Beautiful dress, skims the body perfectly and flatters. the silky and breathable fabric is everything-- it's made of cupro (used as a silk substitute but breathes like cotton-- uniqlo uses it in their ""airism"" products which makes it perfect for summer weather!). i wore it to a summer barbecue, dressed down with a denim shirt tied at the waist and simple jewelry, but can easily dress it up with a chunky heeled sandal and statement jewelry. it's gorgeous-- get it!

"As a tall girl, i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however, as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony, the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!",neg
"Love the suit! i ordered two sizes, and this 6 ended up being too small. i'm 35x27x36 and 34d, and there wasn't enough support in the bust. read a lot of mixed reviews regarding sizing on the seafolly suits, so i'm glad i got two. suit is flattering and i love the coverage in the bottom. some boyshort suits are ""cheeky,"" but these are not like that. only complaint is that while there is a pocket for the cups, they are sewn on top.",pos
"I bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if it's a color you wouldn't normally wear. the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath; i'm looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweater.
i'm a 34f and size 12 fit me easily with extra room under the arms. the gathering stops above the bust so that it fit's snug above and loose below. worn loose, the blouse is fairly long, coverin",pos
"The cut is small. i am 5'9"", 150 lbs and usually wear 6-8/medium pants. medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rear.the polyester will be hot in summer. returning for another brand.",neg
"I could not resist this top. it is super cute, the material is nice and thick (you can get away with wearing no bra). shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection. i can't wait to wear this :). i think the cut is very flattering for all figures. top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though.",pos
"This sweater is absolutely adorable! i was worried about the layers looking too frumpy but they were not - i normally wear a size medlum (8), but i sized down on this sweater on a gut feeling and bought a small --i didn't want it to be too loose or billowy, and it fits perfectly. will be so cute with jeans but also with skirts for work! you will be so happy you bought this one.",pos
"I'm a little heavier than i'd like due to postpartum fluff and have to gradually lose because of breastfeeding, so i look for bottoms with enough give in the waist that will still fit once i reach my goal weight. for reference i'm about 33"" waist x 44"" hips with a goal of 31"" waist x 40"" hips, so roughly a size 12/14 getting back to an 8/10. i bought a medium and it stretches enough to fit. this skirt is a solid staple and the colors are just lovely. the flat elastic in the waistband doesn't rol",pos
"I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with. my recent preference has been for high-rise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash. when i tried these on in my normal size, they were so cute that i bought them full-priced. i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy (which is what makes them soft and comfortable), but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours. by th",neg
"This is a beautifully designed jacket that everyone will love and won't want to take off! i went with the gray wool. i always worry about jackets that are too snug, as i am busty, but this fit is superb. the arms are unusually long (though maybe this is good for you). i had a dressmaker shorten my sleeves by one inch, so now it's perfect for me. i bought the regular medium, my usual size (size 8 or medium top, 34f). i tend to wear my blazers and jackets open, but it's nice to know that i can but",pos
"I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit, especially online!  

this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.   

the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece.",pos
"My review is of the ""black motif"" (no longer listed online, but i saw a bunch in the clearance sock bin at the georgetown dc store, today, 12/27/2015).

i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!

two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look.",pos
"Fits great, not too tight/baggy. pattern on shirt is pretty and should work for layering or wearing on its own.",pos
"Wore it this weekend and the compliments were overflowing! it's exceptionally flattering for busty women (i'm a 32dd). i had to size down from an 8 to a 6, but even the 8 looked good, just a bit loose in the bodice. v neck is just right, not too low, not too high. print is gorgeous in person - colors are much richer than the online photo. the flowy skirt is very slimming and forgiving for hourglass and pear shaped body types. but if you have slim hips, you might feel like you're swimming in fabr",pos
A great everyday tee!! dress it up a bit with a great gold necklace!! looks nice with jeans and brown boots!!,pos
Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.,pos
"I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.",neg
This dress is amazing! i have a b cup and didn't quite fill out the top enough. but that is a small tailoring fix. i am completly in love with this dress and recommend it highly,pos
"This is such a cute and flattering top. it isn't a style i would normally gravitate to, but i liked the color so i thought i'd try it on. i ended up trying on the medium because they were out of my usual large and it fits great. it drapes really nicely and looks super cute with jeans and booties. the little stripe of ladder lace around the middle is a bit see thru but not revealing. it's a nice top for transitioning from summer to fall.",pos
"First, i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread. i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic, but actually i'm glad i didn't know because i love it. it does not look cheap and it really works. the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough. the real issue for me is the size. i ordered the small and it is huge. enormous. especially from the back. the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it's almost a bat wing kind of thing and",pos
"This dress is cute!! i ordered my regular xs which was too large but liked it enough to exchange for an xs petite and hopefully the fit will be better. (the xs was much too wide and came past my knee. i'm 5'2' and 123 for reference).  the grey is very pretty and is blueish gray... very misty and unique. the pockets are awesome and i like that it's lined in a fine poly that shouldn't cling to tights, etc in the winter. if you can find a size that fits you, buy it!",pos
"The shirt fits loosely, but not baggy. beautiful detail on the back and shoulders. very soft and lovely material.",pos
These leg warmers are perfect for me. they are long enough and thick and warm enough to keep me from freezing in cold weather. great for people with large calves.,pos
Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.,pos
"I agree with the previous comments. the vest runs a little large, so you can easily size down for a more form-fitting fit. it is so soft and the colors are lovely ... will be a welcome addition when the weather turns a little cooler. i am so glad i purchased this vest!",pos
"I read the existing reviews, before purchasing, and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large. this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer. i figured by ordering a medium, i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater. this was not the case! the sweater is short, does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind (and i assume the model is taller than i...as models are usually tall). for reference, i am 5'6'', medium build",neg
"Bought this shirt in the black. runs tts, very comfortable and flattering. past left of center shirts in this style/fabric seem to run a little large, but i bought this in my usual retailer m, and it's great. very similar to last years style, but perhaps a tad more fitted. i gave it a 4 for quality b/c i have noticed a little bit of pilling under the arm area, but overall, it holds up pretty well.",pos
"Just to back up what everyone else is saying, this poncho is perfect. it is indeed super soft! casual and fun. i personally thought the coloring at the bottom was even prettier than pictured. this poncho is not tight around the neck, yet not lose. it goes right over your head without messing up your hair. i love the sleeves. they can be worn above the elbow or easily pulled just down below it. a great alternative to a sweater. i ordered the petite xs/s and i'm 5'3. hits right at bum.",pos
"First off, this top is super cozy! i adore an easy top that has beautiful detail - and this one does! the fabric is a lot like a thermal shirt, but not too warm. it's very stretchy!! not sure if it will stretch out with wear, but you could easily size down. the body has a ton of room. because of the cute cut, you could wear it oversized without it drowning you, or you could size down to keep it more slim. the lace is simple and even more beautiful in person! i highly recommend this one - especia",pos
The photos do not do this gorgeous dress justice. the iridescent material makes it perfect for a fancy date night and i received complements from complete strangers. would also be great as a wedding guest or bridesmaid dress!,pos
"I am 5'8"" and about 145 lbs - curvy through hips, small up top and i got a small and it fit great. i got it in the wine and it is a pretty color for fall into winter. the fabric is super soft and cozy!",pos
"I saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on. it fits perfectly. i'm usually a size 4/6 with dresses and the small fit perfectly. it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique. what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time, layered over say.... a black turtle neck and black tights... but i think it can also be worn in the spring, especially with that flower print.",pos
"This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all, except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through, so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!",pos
Top feels like pajamas but looks very classy. the sweater material is so soft. i wear it with a blazer over the top and i get so many compliments on it. wish they had it in more colors! must have!,pos
"While contemplating on purchasing these pants. after receiving them, quality was superb, waffle material 5 spandex, beautiful green color, and 2 snaps in the front,  zipper and 2  front and back pockets. material has alot of give and wide legs. these pants don't come to the ankle so don't expect it. sort of like capri but longer, lose fitting and wide legs. nice addition to my closet. i hit the jackpot now and again w/ this store.",pos
"This sweater is so soft and warm and i love it with the matching leggings. i say it is true to size, however i ordered it a size up so that it covers the bottom/crotch area when i am wearing the leggings. normally wear an xs, ordered a small and it works well. it is very well made. i absolutely love it!",pos
"I tried this shirt and really loved the feel, and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery, and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn't too boxy on me, but i'm between m&l, and sized down, so that might have helped. if i didn't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!",pos
"I ordered the black and red check leggings thanks to the suggestion of the retailer stylists online. there is no way in a million years that i would have picked these out due to my body shape. i'm petite size 6 and 120 pounds and 5 feet tall. i ordered a petite small. i do not have skinny legs and ordered these anyway. they are so flattering that i'm thinking of ordering the grey pair. the red pair are kind of darker. the picture makes the red look so much bright than they really are. trust me, yo",pos
Super soft. pretty blue green color. packs super well for traveling.,pos
Omg. i also bought this years ago. i have worn it every year and get compliments on it every day! i'm so excited to buy it again! i might actually buy 2. just love it!!!,pos
"This tank is so classic and summery and i never want to take it off. it's very soft, and the fabric is decently thick. it hangs away from the body and has a nice swing to it. it works well for my very straight figure and small chest, but finding the right fit might be problematic for someone more blessed in the chest area than me.",pos
"Fell in love with the dress at the first sign. yes, have to confess that i always love white dresses- but this dress is not only beautiful on the picture, but also very pretty to put on. material is natural, gentle on my skin; style is simple, romantic, and it goes well with almost everything to dress up or dress down... very comfortable to wear, good for a long moon-light beach walk.
size runs large, have to get petite xxs, and it fits perfectly (normally i go with petite 2 for a fitted dress)",pos
"Beautiful cobalt blue dress.
i wore it for christmas and had many compliments.",pos
"I love this romper. it's really flattering and well made. at most stores, i wear a medium but normally at retailer i wear a small. i had to exchange the small for a medium, but other than i really loved it!",pos
"This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.",neg
"I just got this in the mail, absolutely gorgeous. the hook and eye closure is very secure, i have no problem walking or sitting in this dress. i ordered a aize 8 going by the previous reviews that this dress ran small, i could have ordered my normal 6, but the 8 fits pretty good,just a tad big. the dress is more chocolate brown than black and the detail is really stunning!! you can't find unique dresses like this anymore, truly beautiful!!",pos
Love these jeans!!! they are the perfect fit from waist to ankles. their first wear was like i'd been wearing them for years. i paired them with the pintuck button-down tunic.,pos
"Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.",pos
"These pants are great. i am 5'6"" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however, they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines.",pos
"This has such a beautiful shape, goes with so many things and has gotten a lot of compliments already. my favorite new piece.",pos
"Saw this on sale and tried it, not expecting anything and wound up loving it. i am 5'4 and it covers my thighs and rear well so i can wear it with leggings. it came mid thigh on me. the red is a rich burnt orange/red. i love that is is mostly cotton so i won;t get overheated.",pos
This is a gorgeous dress. the fabric has the look of linen (though it is not) and the lining is a soft mesh. looks both relaxed and stylish.,pos
"Such a cute shirt! i picked up the white-with-flowers that is not being shown online yet. the straight white looks like it could wrinkle and definitely needs a tank underneath but the white with flowers was not see-through and seems like it will require a bit less steaming (the detail masks wrinkles :)) the flowered-design also has a small tie at the neck that i don't think was on the solid color design (can't totally remember) - cute extra detail but not overly obvious, it blends into the shirt",pos
I am in love with pilcro pants. i am typically a petite 26 or 27. i'm a 27 in these khakis. which is could have them in every color and style.,pos
I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly. the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations couldn't fix it. maybe it's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw.,neg
"I got the moss and love the color. the style and size in 31p is perfect for my short self. very comfy for work. now, i need more colors...",pos
"I really like this dress! i wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered it, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits well and it's very cute and different.",pos
"I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106, 5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!",pos
"Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately, none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)",neg
"Beautiful! soft, flattering but not clingy~ i bought in the green which is not a typical color in the summer palate which makes it all the more appealing.",pos
"Bought this in the turquoise color and it is awesome. for those worried about it being see-through, i'm wearing a black bra and you can't see it. it's the perfect weight. super bummed that the green is sold out but may check in stores.",pos
"Nice modern print, vibrant colors, and not sheer (no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot!)",pos
"I originally bought this jacket in a medium, but the sleeves were a bit long and overall fit a little big. i decided to exchange for a small and i am so glad i did!! this jacket feels great and the sleeves hit at just the right spot in the small size. i normally wear a 6.",pos
"This sweater is gorgeous - the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft. i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer, and i tend to wear petites. the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind!",pos
"This sweatshirt is really nice!  it's oversized so best worn with leggings or skinny jeans. it's very warm, without being too thick. it looks almost exactly like the picture.   the quality seems pretty good, but we'll see how it holds up after it's washed.",pos
"The turqoise color is pretty, however, it did smell bad out of the package. i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants, bra and cami! hope it all comes out in the wash. i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub.",neg
"This ribbed henley is incredibly soft. you'll love the way it feels, but it does run a little small so i'd recommend getting one size up if you don't want it to be too form fitting.",pos
"This skirt has a beautiful, flattering feminine fit. the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and, of course, the layers are what make this piece a stunner. i highly recommend it. can see wearing this all year, dressed up with jewels, or down with boots and a casual sweater.",pos
"I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch, but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch, you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.

first they started piling, which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before, and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f",neg
Fits perfectly! super soft and well-made! love the 3/4 sleeves and back drop. i can expect i will wear a lot in this coming fall/winter season in ca. highly recommend!,pos
"I got this in a medium, its really big, i added a belt and ir looks alot better, the medium seems like a large, im a size 6 or 8, should have gotten a small, now they are out will use the medium with a belt",pos
"I am in love with this top. it is so feminine and cute. i wear it with skinny jeans and tall boots and feel so pretty!! i got the cream color. i wish there were more solid colors. i usually wear a medium, which is what i ordered, and i love how it fits. i like flowy tops so it is perfect. please make solid colors!!!",pos
"This was a last minute addition to my online order to hit the free shipping! anyway... this ended up being my favorite item from my order! i love the way it wraps and also lays open. i didn't realize that the fabric was a mix of two different knits, but i think it adds nice interest. i ordered the red,which is a nice, deep red...not an obnoxious fire engine red. it's very complimentary to my skin tone and dark hair. i run between a small and medium, but chose the medium since it looked like it c",pos
Such a festive sweater and i've received many compliments anytime i wear it. unique and fun to wear!,pos
"I was so excited to get this dress. i need it for a wedding, and i thought i had hit the jackpot. the dress arrived with a small tear. the seams are puckered and badly seen.  for an almost $300.00 dress, the quality is terrible. i expect better from retailer. i'm so disappointed.",neg
Purchased this shirt for holiday photos and it worked great. very flattering and a fun take on plaid. more feminine than your classic plaid button down.,pos
"Gorgeous dress and very flattering but it does run quite small in the bust (i'm 32 dd) and even the shoulder area (i rarely have problems there). i also find the side zipper a pain. sized up from a 2p to a 4p. the lace detail is especially beautiful and the color is more peachy than pink, the print quite saturated and not too pastel for early fall. i can see wearing it for 3 seasons, at least in ca.",pos
"This is a lightweight sweater...good for the office and summer evenings.  here in so. cal it's a good weight sweater year round.  love the lace trim.  runs a bit large but not too bad.  color is a light cornflower blue, not lavender.  this works for me but if you're looking for a lavender sweater, you might want to think twice.",pos
"This top is beautifully made and designed.
material is soft and comfortable however it's very boxy. the details on the side stick out.
i just found it not very flattering for me.",neg
"I am in love with this bathing suit. it is super cute and flattering and i love the pattern on this specific style. it is also seems to be very well made. i haven't worn it in the water yet so i can't really speak to that. i would say that i believe it is true to size, which means that it is a little tight since bathing suits need to be tight to stay on in the water! for reference i am a bra size 32dd, around 130 pounds, and 5'5"" and a size 6 fits perfectly.",pos
Well fitted kinda slouchy sweater. matches photo and product description. looking forward to cooler temps!,pos
I am not particularly large but i have thighs! this pair of pants was totally unflattering! my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps. i now understand why it's on sale. you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged. but otherwise skip them. plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily. i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them.,neg
I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.,pos
"This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure. i have 36ddd boobs and a muscular, curvy frame. this top adds about 20lbs.",neg
"I was on the fence about purchasing this dress for a while and finally took the plunge. glad i did because this dress is stunning and very comfortable. i ordered an xsp and it was the perfect length. originally, i had also considered xxsp. while it fit well above the waist, it was slightly too short. for reference, i'm 5 ft 3.5 inches, 105 pounds.",pos
These pants are a great fit. perfect for the in-between seasons. casual comfortable but look very nice and polished when worn. a practical steal at retailer's sale prices.,pos
"I love this jacket. i have not worn it yet, as the weather is still very warm, but i am looking forward to wearing this a lot this fall. the cropped cut is very flattering and the vegan leather very soft, i followed the other reviews and ordered one size up and it;s perfect. i am normally a size 4 and went with he medium. the plum color is quite neutral in person. i also love the printed lining. i did notice quite a few long threads around the lining sewing, i hope this is just an overlooked pos",pos
"This cardi is cuter in the stock photos. in person, the colors are a bit more drab. stock photos also don't show quite how much of a swing shape this has. it is very soft, though. returned it!",neg
"I got the shirt, the cami, and the shorts and they are all great. super comfortable fabric, really well made, and really cute. love them all!",pos
Absolutely love this shirt. i purchased this in the black and blue. perfect for holiday parties.,pos
"This dress is great for work and play. i bought a l and a xl. both fit well, but the sleeves in the large were quite tight. so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose. this dress looks great on. i wish the material was a little higher quality, but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots. the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline.",pos
"This skirt sparkles when you wear it- beautiful in winter. it is made well, great design and fit, true to size. it is a beautiful fabric with deep blue flowers stitched in, as well as soft silvery gold thread sewn into the background. great length too. fabulous.",pos
I love this sweater. it is classic but has details that make it fresh and different. the tie in the back offers very interesting detail.,pos
"I ordered an extra small. it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up. i've tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels. really a cute and versatile sweater. i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful. this one works perfectly for me, however",pos
"Light weight and cotton, great summer top. runs a little big but it suits me. i'm short and find the straps a drop loose because they're a fixed length meant for someone a little taller than 5'1"" me, but they are not falling down so far. also, if you look at the photo of the model wearing the top in black, you can see through the lace to the bra underneath. if you just wear a bra the same color as the top it's not at all noticeable. great piece for summer.",pos
"I love this top, the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night. the small fits me perfect and i don't wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned, but might if i wore it to work",pos
This was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on. love it! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way. colors are great. got the petite size. the pattern is different for each one so each is unique. mine has. lot more navy blue.,pos
"This is one of the cutest jackets i have ever owned. nice soft material. i have a steamer so won't have to iron this, depends on how picky you'd be about that. great cut. ordered my normal size. sending another jacket back that luckily i hadn't worn yet. i know between the two, i will always pick this one. didn't find the sleeves too long which was good as no petite option. seriously so excited to wear this. :)",pos
"I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges, so i figured i'd take a chance. it is gorgeous, and not too big! the quality is fabulous, and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can't wait to wear it!!!",pos
"Love it! cute, flattering, and even though the material is thin - it is still very cozy. i have no complains about the quality; i haven't found any loose threads or other issues.

the cardigan runs tts. i got m instead of my usual s (because s was out of stock), and it's a little loose in the armpits. but i still like the cardigan and i'm keeping it.",pos
"I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available. unfortunately, i was disappointed on arrival. besides being more muted color-wise, the sizing is way off. i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me. on the model, it looks like it skims the body, when in reality, it falls like a tent. i tried tucking it into a skirt, but there was just too much fabric.

though the neck worked for me, i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow. also, it",neg
"I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric, but it's fine. the neutral color is a little bland, but i can wear it with bright pants. since i expected it to run large i ordered a small. the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream, plus it looks amazing from the back.",pos
This is a great summer skirt that is good for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and the colors go with most anything. one downside is it wrinkles easily.,pos
"I love swing dresses but they never seem to work out for me. however, lately i have been trying on swing tops like this one and they are super scores! i love this top! in my store, they had a rack of test materials where they don't have the full line but they have a look at some online features or clothes that are very new releases. this was on the rack. i knew it wasn't my size but i tried it on anyway and i am absolutely in love. i am waiting for a sale (as always) but i am going to get this i",pos
"This is the perfect dress to take traveling. dress it up with heels or down with sandals. warm up and wear it with a short black sweater. a nice easy elegant dress. size small fit nicely, medium probably would have been fine too.",pos
"I ordered the xxs p as this dress is not a fitted dress, and that was the right size for me. only thing is the length is a bit linger still 9lower on calf for me), the straps are almost tight, so i would say the dress is a reversed taper shape. color is beautiful, i ordered green as the other color (plum) doesn't have petite available. green is rich, and classy, the fabric is surprisingly soft. i love the little details in the velvet. definitely need a strapless bra for this one.

I love wearing sweaters when it gets cooler out but hate the bulkiness that comes with them. this is a super cute sweater that isn't too bulky and gives you the sexiness you're looking for! great material.,pos
Better than the picture - i like the layered look and the texture of the fabric. great top.,pos
"I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim. it is so much cuter in person than it looks online - i wouldn't have given it a second look based on these pictures... it perhaps runs a tiny bit large, but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did. if you're thin you may want to size down - i have a decent amount of ""padding"" that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted (5'4"", 130 lbs). the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu",pos
"Love these pants. it's hard to get really dark dark black jeans with a little stretch, and these are perfect. i also like the cut as a bit of a change from skin tight leggings. and the fabric is super cool, like a lightweight brocade denim. i get compliments every time i wear them.",pos
"This jacket is amazing! i at first bought the medium because that is what i usually wear on top. when it arrived in the mail i put it on asap. it fit but was definitely too form fitting to wear a sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath. so i called the store and asked them to reserve a large and that one fit perfectly! it's loose enough to wear something underneath but not so loose that it looks to big. it is so soft and cozy, and the hood is my favorite part!",pos
I love the oversized look of this jacket--my building is kept freezing cold so while at work i am constantly fiddling with cardigans and scarves and a space heater to try to keep from freezing while working and i thought this jacket would be a great jacket that basically functions as a blanket while still looking professional. (my boyfriend doesn't quite get the 3/4-length sleeves but that definitely keeps the look of this jacket polished--if they were longer i think it would be too much just li,pos
"The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely, but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless. it fit me like a sack, i ordered the m and i suppose i should've sized down, but even in the s i'm afraid this would be far too large. for reference, i am 5'7 and 135 lbs. i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasn't right on me. i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure. returned.",neg
"This may be the most beautiful top i've ever purchased from retailer!  gorgeous, classy, comfortable and one-of-a-kind!  i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it.  runs large; buy a smaller size than you usually wear.  you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top.  i wear it on the shoulders; a perfect ""10""!",pos
"Saying that these pants are comfortable would be redundant. they are over & above in comfort. i wear a size 8; and they are right on in sizing. i want to comment on the color/print. to see the green, i had to take the pants by a window with natural light and look closely. that being said, i think the pants take on the color of top one chooses. i walked through my closet with the pants in hand. they match with light grey, periwinkle blue, light sky blue, navy, white, your choice. i do prefer a so",pos
"Just received these this morning and so happy. cartonnier always makes a substantial quality product. might run a little large,depends how roomy you want them, lovely colors and perfect length. wish they came in other colors.",pos
"This sweater is really beautiful! i love this brand and this piece is one of their best yet! the fringe is perfect and flowy, a sweater that you can team with jeans and boots and be the best dressed in the room. tts, soft with no itch, really happy i bought it, and because of the color and weight this is an all year sweater which i love, because i know i will not want to pack it away. it fits just like the photo.",pos
"This dress is amazing! it's perfect for a casual family or friend get together, or a fall dress with boots. the back ties to make it more flattering than just a shift dress. quality of the dress is great, and the material is very versatile.",pos
"I love this shirt!!! the front is a little shorter than i thought it would be, but overall, it is so cute and comfy!! wish they had it in more colors!!",pos
"I was excited to see this sweater in my local store. i have been coveting it online. it was just as pretty in person as i hoped it would be. 
the color is vivid and beautiful. i loved the buttons down the back. 
i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small. i tried it on and liked the way it fit. i wanted a snugger look. i think the small would have worked too, just a looser feel.
the fabric is very soft. now just waiting for cooler weather so i can wear it.",pos
"Really loved this - so soft and snuggly. was unsure about ordering shirt size - (s) or jacket size for layering (m). ordered a small. fits perfect! definitely wouldn't have wanted the medium. 5'4, 135 lbs for reference. love this one!!! great find.",pos
Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back,neg
"This is a nice, simple, understated sweater. i got the green and the navy and they look different enough to keep both. it''s a throw-it-on-over-a-shirt sweater, with the right length to let whatever is underneath show. and the ribbon tie on the back is a nice touch.

i also like that the width of the sweater is an alternative to everything that's cut so tightly fitted - it's a nice width, with some room, without being boxy.",pos
"This is a gorgeous bathing suit. the colours are more brilliant than the ones in the picture, and much more beautiful. comfortable, chic, and unique",pos
The material is so soft and the design makes it a little more fancy so you can dress this tank up or down. its definitely an instant favorite. and the color blue is a beautiful rich blue,pos
"As a busty but small-waisted girl, i normally would not wear a loose shift like this. however, it turned out to be perfect for hiding my early/mid pregnancy belly. the dress is extremely comfortable, and it will also come in handy in the postpartum months. in fact, it looks so cute that i might just add it to my regular wardrobe after all.",pos
"I grabbed my typical size (8) and found it fit snug in the bust. the fabric has plenty of stretch, so the snugness was fine, especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front. it's lowcut, but i didn't feel particularly exposed. i ended up not buying it because i don't think it fit my body right. the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole",neg
I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious. the fit is absolutely incredible! i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well. it hugs your body in all the right places. i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering. gorgeous dress!!,pos
This dress is very flattering and well made. i can hardly wait to wear it. it's one of my favorite retailer purchases.,pos
"I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m",neg
I've received so many complements on this top. it's so comfortable and every time i wear it someone compliments the color. i ordered it in each color!,pos
This shirt is amazing. the pictures on the model do not do the shirt justice! the shirt is a bit longer in person than shown on the model. the colors are also more vibrant. the material is so soft and has great flow. i am excited to dress it up for work with a pencil skirt and have the option to wear with skinnies and a cute sandal on my off days.,pos
"I agree with the other reviews - it's a little small in the arms, low cut in the chest, but really broad in the shoulders. i bought the xsp, which is a size up from my normal xxsp. they didn't have xxsp to compare. and i am a small person with big athletic shoulders, and my usual problem is with things being tight in the shoulders and fit everywhere else. overall, an excellent buy at the sale price. size up for more room in the chest and arms.",pos
"I saw this one for the first time today in-store and was not impressed. it is a lacey material with an under-layer, so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous. unfortunately, i did not like the swing dress cut, especially not in white. i wasn't sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the 70s or a shortened version of my grandmother's wedding gown, but either way it was not working for me. to be fair, swing dr",neg
"This shirt looked so perfect on the model, and i was so excited to get it! when i received it, it was so soft and the color was so vibrant. the only thing is, it's too big. it kind of looks like a maternity shirt. it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me, but i'm happy with it other than that. i'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time.",pos
"Love this dress. it is airy, lightweight, and comfortable - the kind of dress i'm sure i will wear all summer long. from the pics online i thought the sleeves would have embroidered detail, however it was just the print of the fabric. i like it just the same. it comes with a slip underneath so it swings nicely. i ordered it in both a s and xs. there is plenty of fabric and it is not at all cling-y so the xs was fine. excited to wear it!",pos
"This dress in the blue motif has a really flattering fit and look. the dress especially in this color, hides the belly area well and does not make you look wide if you are heavier in the bottom half. it is not too short and goes past my knee. i am 5'3'.'' the material is also really soft and the dress is easy to pull on.",pos
"The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however, the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.",neg
"I love , love this top !! it looks just like the picture on model. the front is a soft t-shirt and the back is so cute and flattering . super unique and comfortable style.!! i am 5'4 -105 and xs fits perfect.",pos
"Wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors. i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman (i'm 5'3"", ordered a s), this just looked like a nightgown on me. sorry to say it's going back.",neg
"This dress is even more amazing in person. the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance. the kimono like sleeves have the same details - especially nice for toasting!
be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!",pos
"Looked really cute on the hanger, so i took it with me into the dressing room. the fabric is super soft, and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short! you can't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg. the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer. i wish i could pull this off...maybe i'm just too old for it.",neg
This jacket is perfect!! the denim mixed with the military style is such a good combo. it fits great and is very comfortable. the little ties in the back are a cute addition.,pos
"Upon opening this top, i thought for sure it was going to be too s mall, but it stretches nicely and is gorgeous when on. it is a little thin, and you have to be careful that it's not too tight or you can see skin through the knots, but i love this shirt. i got the xs, which is my usual size. i could probably have used the s, but didn't want to pay for shipping to exchange it as i don't have a store anywhere near me and the xs was fine.",pos
"This is a great top! i love the color of the pink... it is the perfect color of pink; not too bright or too light, but a pretty pink-coral spring color! i am fair skinned and this color looks great on.
i got the 0 regular and it fits perfect. i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i usually get petite but i can't imagine this shirt being shorter... it's a great length. i can wear it slightly tucked in or out without it looking sloppy. it also hides any belly issues for those mamas out there. love it! perfect fo",pos
"I originally bought the tan at the store. i loved it so much and ordered the red, but went down a size as it does run big. perfect for the summer.",pos
"The sweater is comfortable and a good weight. the zipper is very difficult, but i do not have to unzip the sweater to pull it on.",pos
"So, i usually find that retailer tops run large (everywhere else i'm a medium, but i'm always a small at retailer) but with pants or slacks i'm usually an 8 and i always have to size up in retailer to a 10, but based on some of the other ""runs large"" reviews, i stuck with my normal size 8 and they fit perfectly! super cute. not lined, but the material has a nice weight to it, so that doesn't bother me. will def be wearing to the office.",pos
"I too will be returning this sweater. love the style, shape and fabric, but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap.",neg
This top is adorable! runs a bit small but so cute worth the price and tons of compliments!!!!,pos
I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away. i purchased a s and the fit was very off. the arms were long (which i don't mind) but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering. i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it.,neg
I wore this with a velvet moss-colored skirt (also sold at retailer) that hits above knee and received so many compliments. the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous. i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it. not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist. sleeves hit above wrist as well.,pos
My favorite for work or going out. the perfect black shirt.,pos
"Loved this vest when i tried it on in the store, and ordered it during the last sale.   i usually wear a medium, and the xs/s fit much better than the m/l.   getting excited for fall!   now if the weather would cooperate, so i can wear this cute new vest!",pos
"These paige skinny jeans are lightweight, snug, super soft and extremely flexible allowing for tons of movement. great for dressing up or down and a great addition to any ladies closet.",pos
So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.,pos
"Wow! this sure is close fitting, as in suction cups to your body! yikes, definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves. to me, it seems like the material will wear well. i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it, not sure. it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even 5 lbs, it won't work. i ordered the medium and am usually a small. the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy. i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas.",neg
"I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w",pos
I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.,pos
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! the colors are actually very bright. it has a little embroidery and beading in the chest area. the fabric is actually very soft and it comes with built in slip. i found that it runs true to size. i got a medium, as i wanted it to be more roomy. i'm planning to wear it with booties, long boots, or sandals in the spring. i think it will make a great teacher dress.",pos
"I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress. it's very comfortable and stretchy so i got a 6 petite and it fit perfectly, where normally i need an 8 or a 10 because clothes are made so tight now. it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips. and for the bottom of the dress being white, it surprisingly wasn't see through. i wouldn't go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no",pos
"Love this! only wish it wasn't so seasonal so i could wear it more often. this is the softest shirt in my wardrobe. can't believe how nice it feels on. a little bit slouchy and over-sized. i usually wear a m and bought a m and it feels perfect. like the other reviewer, i was a bit worried about shrinkage but washed it in cold and hung it up and and it cam out fine. did wash first before i wore because the dye smelled a bit strong.",pos
This dress is absolutely stunning and well made. it can be worn throughout the seasons. i love this designer and this dress is a masterpiece.,pos
I ordered these in a medium and they fit but i wanted more coverage so i sized up. i wear a 26 or 27 and i took the large. the large isn't tight at all but the medium was. i like my bottoms to have a lot of coverage and don't mind them a little big. i like how much coverage they provide but still look feminine and cute.,pos
"Got this dress in the mail today, and i am blown away. the fit is amazing! normally i would get an 8 in dresses, sometimes a 6, i got a 6 in this one and it's perfect. hugs in all the right places. everyone needs this dress! i feel like with the style and fit of this dress, it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down. cannot wait to wear this one!",pos
This is a tts cami that should be a staple in everyone's closet. great for layering.,pos
"Fits perfect. i'm 5'3 and the size 2 regular fit perfect. not too long it too short, just perfect.",pos
This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it!,pos
"I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp, my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no",neg
I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.,pos
I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.,neg
"I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!
really retailer? i know you can do better than that...",neg
"I ordered this online, with a little hesitation due to the negative reviews.
it arrived and it is beautiful!
the beading and subtle cut outs are gorgeous.
the colors of the beadwork in contrast to the nude tone of the fabric is stunning and elegant.!
the fit is very very flattering!!!!!
runs very true to size.",pos
"I like the top without the fake fur collar. when the collar is removed the neckline's shape is really nice. the collar seems cheap. i thought the sweater ran true to size. i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs. a small was a good fit although higher armholes would have made the whole thing fit better through the rib cage. it was loose there, but necessary looseness for layering anything underneath.",pos
I love this coat. it was a great purchase and i would reccomend it to others. it looks great with layers and is comfortable for 30-50 degree temps. definitely size down when buying.,pos
I love this sweater. looks great with leggings or high waisted jeans. like most maeve clothing it runs a little large so i would size down. i get several compliments every time i wear this one. super comfortable too!,pos
Purchased this sweater in the blue color which is a gray/blue. it runs large as the xs is still quite roomy on me in the body. although the arms are more snug. great quality.,pos
I loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly. it makes me look like a football player! i am 5'8 135/athletic build and i was swimming in the m. i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads. it hangs and gaps awkwardly. the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short.,neg
"I seriously love this top, and at the sale price it's a steal! i ordered the ivory color and it's just as beautiful in person as in the product photos. i thankfully read the reviews and knew that the sleeves would be slit. i think the slit sleeves add more interest to an otherwise basic blouse. it can be dressed up or down and is great for work (at least in my very casual office). the fit is perfect; i ordered my normal size medium and it's definitely true-to-size.",pos
I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.,neg
"Really like this tunic a lot. it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together. i'm always a fan of pockets too! i ordered the xs -- i'm 5'4"" about 118#. it fits loose but not in a bad way. the fabric allows it to fall well over the body. if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees. glad to have snagged this right away! more tunics like this please!",pos
"Bought my 3rd pair of pilcro cords in the dark turquoise. the other 2 are from previous seasons. love these pants for fall because they are extremely comfortable and stylish. the dark turquoise was paired with the poppy tunic (in blue) at my local store. i liked the pairing and ended up buying both! i find these to fit true to size vs other items at retailer that fit larger. i am a 29 (8) while in most other pants at retailer, i am a 6. i am 5'7 and 135 lbs.",pos
"This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole. first of all, the armhole is way too low! second, there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm. since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem. no need for the side zipper, it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side.",neg
"The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful. the shape of the dress is strange - fitted and tight through the waist, and enormous everywhere else. it was not flattering.",neg
I would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in. they are attached on the inside by a string. if the string broke the pockets would dangle. for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest. too bad.,pos
"Love this top. fits true to size. not to boxy,, sleeves are so cute! looks very rich. a must have in your wardrobe!",pos
"This top is so beautiful! looks even better in person. i was hesitant because of the price, but i am so happy i bit the bullet and ordered. i am a 36c and the bust is slightly snug.",pos
"I picked this dress up in a size 8 - fits tts. i have a 34dd chest; 145 lbs. and 5 ft. 4 inches in height. i have an hourglass figure and the size 10 was too big and the 8 fit just right. the skirt is lined and the upper bodice part is not, it says on the tag hand wash which is a plus because dry cleaning is not a plus. hits me just about 2 inches above the knee. the thick lace detailing is very special and price point with the dress promo made me feel this would be a great dress for the holiday",pos
I absolutely love this dress. it's flattering and feminine. you will love it. it runs large so size down.,pos
I love this poncho/sweater. it feels cozy and looks really cool. can't wait til the weather cools down so i can wear it.,pos
"Looking for a stylish rain resistant coat to wear to ireland this fall and looks like this could fit the bill. the 30inch length is perfect. the faux fur lined collar and opening edges is a lovely touch, fur ends about 6 inches in so not fully lined, but great for weather in 50's-low 60's with a sweater added . ample room for that. i love the look, wish the pockets were just a bit bigger, i can barely fit my hand in. but overall i think it's a keeper.
i ordered m/l and am usually a medium or la",pos
"Wow. i just love this dress. it hangs beautifully and is such a great length. shoulder straps adjustable, simple button closures in back. i wore it dressed up a bit with a sweater and then again more causal without. i got it on sale so it fit even better!! :)",pos
The sleeves are small. should buy a larger size than usual. other than this is perfect.,pos
"Absolutely lovely! even better in real life. this is not your typical cheap, flimsy dress. this is quality! the fabric is interesting, the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering. pay attention to the length ? there are miles of fabric in that fortuny-esque skirt and the model is very tall. i am 5'5"" and slim, and ordered petite small, and it's a little longer on me than it is on the model. i don't mind. i've been looking for a special-occasion dress for a long time and knew this was it",pos
I fell in love with this dress immediately. gorgeous print and colors. light and breezy. classic and comfortable. the petite length is perfect for my height and hits a few inches above the knee. i have a small bust (34a) but a wider rib cage so the petite small was a perfect fit. couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.,pos
"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.

i'm busty, but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered, so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't",neg
"I was so pleased to see this in the store, and i am glad that i had a chance to feel the knit. the combination of wool, cotton, and nylon creates a really soft, luxurious feel to the sweater. i was shocked that it didn't have cashmere in the blend, it is that soft! but, it is equally substantial. this sweater can surely be worn as a piece of outerwear, and it can be used as a layering piece. i consider this one tts because i typically wear a m in a knit that isn't fitted. i disagree with an earl",pos
"I've been looking for a light colored flowy cardigan for awhile and finally found this one is perfect. the materials is soft and has just the right about of details for me with the gently ruffled edges, tie front an some bunching around the sleeves. color is between ivory and tan. i am petite height and medium framed with broad shoulders and since they didn't have petite in stock, i bought regular s. it fits well enough, though i probably could have bought an xs. my new favorite card!",pos
This top is too cute and shows just the right amount of skin without being overt. it can be worn on or off the shoulder and is just enough to cover a tummy without looking maternity. i can't wait for the warmer weather to get here and stay so i can wear this top more often!,pos
"I bought these in 'vintage sage' and i grab for them as often as my favorite skinny jeans. if you are just dipping your toe in colored pants i would reccomend the same color, it is undertsated and easily paired with so many other colors. the legs run a little big but the waist is tru to size, so for comfort i went with my usual size.",pos
"Thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather. i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater. it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece. most bulk is in front, so it can camouflage areas. i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt. perfect!",pos
"Love this top. tried it on in the store and had to have it. did not find it too sheer and could wear my regular bra with it, as the shoulders fit where the straps are. got tons of compliments on it. would have bought in more colors if offered i loved it that much. the perfect bohemian hippie chic top, if there is such a style!",pos
"Runs extremely large. i got an xs and am 5'4"" 115lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size 10-14 and is 5'6"" and above. very disappointed with the size. the quality of the fabric wasn't great either. i wanted it to work so bad but just didn't!",neg
"This shirt is just as great in person as it is online.  it's a substantial fabric which is not see-through which seems hard to find these days with whitish tops.  the color is more off-white without looking yellow.  i ordered a small and medium because i was concerned about the length and tightness in sleeves.  they fit almost the same with the only difference being that the upper sleeves on the small were just a tad bit more fitted, but not in a bad way.  i'm 5'5"" and found the length to be jus",pos
"I love love love these bright red jeans. they fit great, they're super soft and comfortable, and the bright red is a great punch of color. only sad about how expensive they are. at that price point, i decided to return them, but am hoping they get marked down!",pos
This is my new favorite shirt!! you can dress it up or down. so comfy and totally flattering :),pos
"The photos don't look it, but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall. 

disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!",neg
"This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so, if you don't like loose fitting clothes, this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans.",pos
"I am on an retailer diet but i can't stop thinking about this top! tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only they'd had my size in stock i'd have been a goner for sure. it is super comfy -- the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured. while i'm kind of sick of high/low, this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face. love the sparkle -- you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long. so versat",pos
I loved this dress so much i got it in two colors. the colors match the picture online. it's very soft and will work for summer and fall.,pos
"This is my favorite weekend jacket! it is so cute, soft and comfortable! the interior is an extra soft cotton that feels like my most favorite soft tee-shirt?? it is true to size. the best features are the versatility of the neck, pockets. and a little longer in the back - great over leggings/yoga pants. i ordered 2 sizes just in case the sizing was off - an xxs and xxs. i am a 2 petite and the xs is roomy enough for a sweater or sweatshirt under it. the xxs looked and felt great too and had a m",pos
"I love this top so much. i dare say it is one of my favorite retailer purchases to date. i got it in the blue and it is really magical! i get compliments every time i wear it. i have a pair of dressier black leggings that i never know what to wear with, i'm not really a leggings person. but this tunic is exactly the piece! plus, this tunic comes with pockets. what's better than that??!",pos
"The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft, sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think ""oh my gosh, that's the one!"" but if you try it on, you will have this moment. it is comfortable, flattering, and slimming-a prefect everyday dress.",pos
"I love this dress and would have bought it on the spot without hesitation if i just had an event to wear it to! i am plus sized (18 pants, 16 dress, 5' 7"", 36-38 ddd) and i never size down but i was able to with this dress because it is so flowy. the dress hit just below my knee and the only fit difference i saw when i tried on the petite is that it was slightly shorter (still no thigh showing). this would be flattering on absolutely anyone! if you are worried about bulges this dress will give y",pos

"These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.",pos
"I ordered this top in the white and cream color combo and love it so much. the buttons in the back add a sweet touch - easy top for fall, spring (easy to throw a cardigan over), and summer. i ordered a medium, but probably could have done a small. classic retailer!",pos
I love everything about this dress. the sleeve and bodice detail make this dress exceptional. the fit is true to size. i ordered medium. the length is as it appears on the model- just below the knee. the material is of great quality and the slip lining is made of a nice stretchy knit.,pos
"I bought this tee becasue of the color and brand (my favorite tees last summer were by bordeaux) and am so pleased. the color is great for a fall layering piece, and the fabric is so soft....amazing! it may be better for layering, the fabric is very thin.",pos
I purchased this dress for a black tie optional wedding in the mansions of rhode island. it was comfortable and appropriate. i received so many compliments from strangers. wonderfully twirling dress for dancing too!,pos
"This is such a good dress to just throw on and go! the inside is lined with fleece so it's basically a giant sweatshirt. it does run large. i normally wear a medium and i bought the small but could have bought the xs if the difference in length between the two hadn't been about a foot. (i am tall). the color is actually a light mint, not the grayish blue it appears in the picture. overall a great purchase though.",pos
"The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.
the fit is true to size and the 'stressed' velvet fabric is current for this season.
i'm going to enjoy wearing this shirt.",pos
"The dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. i have already worn it several times, with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans. it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white. i took my usual size large, and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer, if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath. the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans don't show thru either. this blouse is lightweight and v",pos

I saw this online and just had to have it! it fits and looks exactly as pictured. excellent for spring or fall.,pos
"I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips, the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam, the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.",neg

This is the second tulle skirt by bailey 44 that i have bought. the color is a little more grey blue than the picture online but the quality is excellent. i am normally a size 6 and i purchased this skirt in medium and fits fine. it is a pull-on skirt but the waistband doesn't have a lot of stretch to it.,pos
"Just got this top in the mail today, and i love it. i bought the white in a small, and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton, but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined, so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large, as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer, and a lot of summers",pos

These are very comfy and look great on! i would like to get a second pair in the lighter color.,pos
"Can't say enough about the style of this trench, the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types. the color is great and there's some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coat.

the sizing is a little hmmm. i ordered a large. i'm usually a 12 on top or a large, mostly to accommodate a larger chest (ddd i think). proportion wise i'm more a medium through the shoulders and in length, so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shape.

"This dress is an absolute win. i was won over on the hanger by the linen fabric's lightweight nature, and then i tried it on. such a good fit for my high waist, and the tie was super flattering. i love this with booties as i was wearing today, but think it will be adorable with espadrilles as well for a more summery look. it's also the rare three season dress, with its cut and coloring working most of the year.  for sizing, i'd say it's true to size. i got my regular size s with no trouble with",pos

I love this dress! the colors are so pretty and the fit is very flattering.,pos
"I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4"", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great.

"I'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me. i'm 5,9"" and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs. as others have said, the pockets make the dress even worse-it's very hard to get them to lay flat. the material is lovely, soft and i liked the gray color, but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum.",neg

"I love pilcro and this pair is another proof why i love it! i bought a pair in light red - the color is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i normally wear petites, but this time bought a regular length, and i love it. it is not too long, as the pants are cropped, and not too short as the petite cut might have been.
pilcro never disappoints me, as i have many different pairs and love each one of them. may go for another color in this same style. they are awesome!!",pos
"Very cute top, just as pictured, nice soft material, color is bright and true to size. wore it to work today on casual friday and received many compliments. highly recommend!",pos
"This is a great white dress for summer.

i tried on a 4 in store and it was too big for me especially in the underarm area. when i tried on the 2, it fit perfectly. i almost felt like there should be a 3, ha ha, because it felt like it made more of a difference to downsize than i expected. that being said, i took the 2 home since it looked like it was tailored to fit my body (but not in a super tight way).

fyi, i'm not super curvy. if you have a larger chest you may need your regular size.",pos
"First, it's huge. i'm not big busted but it's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant. not exactly what i was going for. nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in--and i'm short waisted so no tucking for me. back it went.",neg

Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack -- so sad bc i would have loved it,neg

"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is",pos
I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.,pos
"I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.",pos
"Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape.  it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk.  this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint.  for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender & petite builds may want to size down.  for reference i am 5'3"" 140# 36dd.",pos
"Grabbed this top because i loved the color and to my surprise i loved the style too! it is longer on me than the model (and i'm 5'10"") and it looks great with a long pendant necklace and white skinny jeans. i also wear a white tank underneath just in case, otherwise i think i'd be showing some skin. i like that the front and back are two different materials.",pos

"It's hard to tell how you will like this top unless you try it on first. 1. yes, it runs big and wide but not long, which i like. 2. yes it it is fairly sheer, but the design allows for a fitted tank. 3. i found it adorable once those first two issues were corrected. it's a cute late summer top, easy breathing for humidity. 
i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap, so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out. it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh",pos
"Delayed for a month on back order, this dress was worth the wait!  the beautiful design and colors are just as shown in the pictures.  the length and cut is slimming, more fitted at the bodice with a subtle flare after the waist.  detachable liner dress is a stetchy tank top that goes to the knees.  pullover style with a closed-end side zip that's needed because the knit band design under the bust does not stretch at all.  


if your skin is sensitive--this dress isn't for you.  both the line",pos
"Gorgeous and soft, luxurious feeling sweater! i purchased this in the pink/purple color that is no longer showing as available and just love it. it's unbelievably soft, feels like a blanket. i found that if you sort of fold the neck line under a little, it drapes like a cowl neck a little and not quite as off the shoulder....as it's very cold where i am...can't see wearing it that far off during the winter! that was my solution and i love it! i'm typically and xs, bought the xxs b/c it appeared",pos

"I *love* this tunic. i'm 5'5"" and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings. it is so soft and comfortable, and i love the pink color--very versatile. my favorite thing about this piece--i am a 36dd and haven't bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic, which fits over my chest and is so flattering! many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs large--i agree, but for those of us who are busty, it's an opportunity to wear a cute, breezy style with buttons and a collar!",pos
Make sure to get the whole outfit. the skirt sits high enough so that it avoids the muffin look.,pos

"This sweater is lovely! i have worn it every other day since i got it. it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with. i have gotten compliments every time i've worn it. my daughter, who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear, said i looked like a winter princess in this! it is so flattering and comfortable---a winning combination!",pos
Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it's a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love,pos
These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short. the embroidery gives them a nice touch. i am ordering another pair!,pos
"Absolutely beautiful and well made. this pair of jeans is perfect, no flaws whatsoever. i usually wear size 27 but bought the 26 as it fits better. 27 is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans. i prefer it nice and fitted, so 26 works better. i'm lucky to find them still available in the store while it's not online. i didn't hesitate to buy at full price, which i rarely did. i'm so in love with my new purchase. very happy!",pos
"This dress is very flattering. i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing. i am 5'7"" and wear 34a.  i tried on a size 0 that was at the store as a return and there was about a 3 inch gap to get the side zip closed. although i  normally wear a size 2, i ordered size 4 because of my experience with the dress at the store.  the size 4 is slightly big across the bust but looks ok. i think the size 2 would've been too tight.",pos
"This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on. even the sz 0 was too loose and shapeless. there is no waist as pictured. the hi-low hem, loose fit and wavy waist seam (see in the third close-up picture) make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash. it's really too bad, it's such a pretty combination of patterns.",neg
"I love this top which gives you the look of a blouse but the ease of a t-shirt! the sky blue color is spectacular. the details of this top are beautiful and very flattering! i am tall at 5'8"" and it was plenty long enough. i ordered my typical size s and it was perfect. it is cut to follow the lines of the body. i can't wait until the spring so i can wear it! it would be great if it was available in more colors.",pos
Really cute and comfy and casual skirt. i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer. i did size down one size. highly recommend. will get lots of wear.,pos

"I so wanted to love this tank, and was so excited to get it in the mail! i got a size small (my usual) and it ran so large i wasn't even sure an xs would've fit properly. the material looked lighter and blouse-y on the model, but in person is much thicker and sort of ""hangs"". underarms run large and are gaping from the body. i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it, but it just can't work on me!",neg
"I loved this dress. it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves. the dress has an overall relaxed fit, but the sleeves were way too tight. i had to send back because of sleeves.",neg
First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price. i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular. the length hits right below my bum so it's perfectly structured to wear with leggings. the cable knit is super soft and very warm. wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago. this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price.,pos
Love this sweater. the hi-low length is fun. the elbow length sleeves are great. wish retailer offered more colors! low part of the sweater is a touch clingy at first but stretches well. works well with jeans or leggings. overall perfect layering piece for all seasons.,pos
"I love this top! i was thinking that i was going to need a x-large because i'm very ""busty"". i tried it on at the store, and the large was perfect! it's comfortable and flattering. not boxy at all. i bought it in plum and white. the plum is more a wine color than a purple, which i prefer. 

the buttons are beautiful, but i couldn't see myself buttoning and unbuttoning all of them, since they don't slide out of the buttonholes easily. but i had no trouble slipping it over my head with just a fe",pos
"I tried this blouse on in the store. i'm generally an 8 or 10 in this brand. i got down to a size 4 and gave up. this blouse is huge all the way around. the detail on the blouse is pretty, but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it. i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond. perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myself...i looked ridiculous.",neg
"I tried this dress on and thought it was stunning. the cut was just right, it fit all my slight curves. i'm 5'8 and 145lbs- a slender build and bought the size 8. it is lined and the material is high quality with an illusion of sheer. the length hits me just on my knees and the look is so audrey hepburn. the belt is made of a grosgrain black material and adds another elegant touch if used; it looks great without it too. of course this dress comes at a high price point, but with the 25% of full p",pos

"I was looking for something to wear for an event at an art gallery. i actually really loved this dress! i think it hides body flaws. i tired on the xs, but the small was a little more flowing. it was comfortable and very fun to wear.. i am short, so the length was great for me i wore a different full length black slip under it which was more comfortable for me. go try it on too see if it fits for your body style. it was great for me",pos
"I wore this dress for this first time today, and it is a head-turner. sure to be a new favorite! i received several compliments while out running errands. the dress is flattering to my hourglass shape (i tied it in the back). it is not at all clingy; it flows nicely. the top of the dress is bra-friendly and not too low cut. i am 5'8"" and found the length to be just right for me; the medium skims the tops of my feet, and i wore the dress with flat sandals. unlike another reviewer, the dress i rec",pos
"I usually do not like three quarter sleeve shirts and i do not like tie necks of any sorts. this blouse has both and i love it! i loved it in pictures and, against my two dislikes listed above, i gave it a chance. i am glad i did. the shirt is lined in the body which means the white one is not see through...yey, no need for cami underneath! the lining also adds extra warmth as this is a very thin fabric shirt. the sleeves are loose enough so that the 3/4 length does not restrict me. the tie some",pos

"These jeans are so comfortable and do not stretch out enough to size down, in my opinion. right when i put them on i could tell they fit perfectly. i have been buying pilcros for several years and have not been happy with the stet ankle jeans from the last 2 yrs because although they were very flattering when you first put them on, they stretched out so much it was annoying.

"Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect, very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels, flats, or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit.",pos

This dress is amazing and spans multiple uses. i brought it to st. john with me and used it as an after swim dress as well as a going out on the town dress. it is flattering and a light but durable material. the only thing that was even remotely challenging was that i needed to adjust my bra straps to be hidden. overall i loved the dress and totally recommend it.,pos

"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing, and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers, i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos, but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted, and although it is i",pos
"These are not only comfortable, but so cute. they are something you don't see on everyone else, and people always comment. i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on. the materiel is lightweight and flowing. i love these casual, beautiful beach pants. i got a small, my usual size and they fit great. 5'3'"", 130 lb.s. i wear tee shirts, bathing tops, coobies, any kind of top looks swell. get them while you can. i got the peach and black color.",pos
"I ordered this in a size small for a pre-wedding brunch in dc in october. i am 5' 4"" and usually wear a m in dresses and a s in retailer tops. this dress is full and flowy, but the top is less generous if you are full-busted.. i am a 34 dd and the top of the dress is almost too small. i love it so much and it is so flattering and fun, so i decided to keep it. i can see wearing this on many more occasions.",pos
"I ordered this in the burgundy and am in love with the print and color, very feminine without being over the top.
i'm 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a and the 2 fit perfect. the cut is drapey without being maternity like and i appreciate that's it not as long and full as many of the other tops out there, making it easier to wear with some pants or skirts. it even has little snaps to hold your bra strap in place, although i doubt i would use those. this top is appropriate for any age without looking too girly",pos
"I saw this dress in the retailer store and fell in love with it. tried it on, and even though i was wearing jeans and desert boots, the dress looked terrific! it's great, can obviously be dressed up or down, a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! thanks retailer!",pos
Beautiful stitching on the sweater. very soft and a nice length as well. like the soft brown color - will match many things in my wardrobe.,pos
"This blouse is beautiful, and very versatile, as others have said. i seem to have been buying many maeve prints lately, and got used to that fit. this blouse fits slimmer, but not tight, and ends up extremely flattering. the arms are also a bit slimmer in cut but not too tight -- the fabric has a little give/stretch and so even f they aren't totally loose, it's still comfortable. the lace detail is subtle but pretty. i am going to wear this to death, i can tell.",pos
"I really didn't expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those, but after trying both pairs on, i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro, but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8, which is what i seem to we",pos
"Just received yesterday & i love this skirt! it's crazy soft, very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate. great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath. sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves.

only annoyance is it's a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit. you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk.

"I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping, and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl",pos
"For a couple weeks, i debated making this purchase. in fear that my size would no longer be available, i ordered this lovely top. when it arrived, i was immediately disappointed with its colors...unlike the vibrant colors in the photo, the top's colors were dull...more a brown than orange and gray rather than lavender. had the fit been better, i would have kept this item despite of its color. it's cut weird! though it runs slightly large, i felt the top was ill fitted through the upper bust and",neg

"This blouse is perfect in so many ways: it's cotton, the fit is super flattering, the design is gorgeous. i never, and i mean never, wear red, but i made an exception here due to the exceptionally stunning embroidery. i know this will be comfortable this summer; the fit is slightly loose, so the air can flow. the cotton is light but not thin, no cami needed. a medium size fits me very well; i am size 8/medium top, 34f, 130#. i love that the armholes are high and hide any flaws. the button design",pos
I just bought this and tried it on on a whim and am so happy i did! it's so much more flattering on than this photo depicts. i think it'll be one of my summer staples this year! give it a try!,pos
Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.,pos
This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.,neg
"As others mentioned, you have to unbutton all tiny buttons to put on and off... i do hope this gets easier with use... but - gorgeous and flattering as all get out! :-) i love the design in the back, and the little annoying buttons are sooo cute. the cut is super flattering, and classy. i can wear this to work, or out, just don't drink too much water ladies.... i am 115 lbs and 30dd chest, and the 0 petite was perfect. seriously, beautiful... so torn (keeping it for now!)",pos
"I was looking for a dress for an upcoming interview. this fit the bill. when i took it out of the packaging i was worried it would be boxy, but it hit in all the right places. it was loose enough allowing for movement, but accentuated my waist. it hangs to just above my knee in an xl (i typically wear a 14-16). i was very impressed with the material. it feels very soft and luxurious.",pos
"This dress runs a little smaller than most maeve dresses, but it is so cute. i still ended up getting my regular size 6, but will need to wear spanx with it to get a smoother line. nice material, and great color. the store had just gotten it in when i bought it, and everyone who saw it was raving over it.",pos
"This top is everything it promises to be. i read other reviews and purchased a small (i'm typically between an x-small/small depending on the day of the week) and was glad i did. a medium would definitely have been too big but the small fit perfectly. i have a shorter torso (5'3""/117 pounds) so i didn't experience any apprehension about my stomach showing. i paired it with a pair of skinny black ankle pants and a pair of navy and grey d'orsay heels. it worked wonderful and i can't wait to pair i",pos
"I was recently asked to be a speaker at an important fundraising event for homeless & abused women in our city. i wanted to appeal to the affluent crowd by my physical presentation, and let my words follow with a heartfelt presentation of the value & worth of these precious ladies.

it gives me that extra edge of authenticity & encouragement to do the most w/what has",pos
I bought this in red and wear it a lot. it is so soft and comfortable! i love all the fabric and the design. the longer sleeve length is amazing! it is a perfect tee! you can tell from the pics there's a lot a fabric and it's supposed to be loose and drape like that. it fits like in the pics and is true to size. wear a tank underneath in case there's a strong wind.,pos

if they are black or blue?",pos
This piece didn't make sense to me.  maybe it's bc i'm a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer.  i didn't think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear.  it went back.,neg
This is a perfect casual too to pair with jns and shorts for spring!!,pos
"Oh, i wanted this dress to work! i bought it in green, red and the solid blue. all ran really small. i *just* fit in a 10, when i would normally take a 6 in retailer sizes (5'8"" and 140 lbs). as with many other reviewers, i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw. it took a long, slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations. such a cute style, was really bummed it didn't work. i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot, but they wer",neg
"I bought these on sale and love, love them! they are comfortable and super cute with the print detail on the calves and around the waist. i am waiting to receive the matching hoodie. don't know it i will wear them together since i don't like to be too ""matchy"". i have worn the leggings with a long black tunic top and grey slip on sneakers. very happy with this purchase!",pos
"I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online. being 5'10"" i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint. however, being 5'10"" also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short. it looks ridiculous. i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in 80 degree weather. unfortunately after waiting so long for it's arrival this is going back.",neg
I bought both colors thinking i might like one since i wasn't totally sold on colors looking online. well the cut is sooo flattering that i was sold and had to keep both. this shirts are great.,pos
I really loved this in the catalog. the fabric and details are very pretty. however it's a lot of fabric without much form. my husband suggested it for maternity (not realizing it has fitted slip). not for curvy/ hourglass.  had to send it back.,neg
"I love this top, it's long enough to to wear with leggings and the ribbon in the back really dresses it up. the only negative is that the material pulls easy and only on the space dye color, not the solids but i still love it! for reference i ordered xs and it fits perfectly i am 5'2 125lbs",pos
"This is a great top and worth the money. nice flow to it, soft material and light weight for hot summer days. many light weight tops are sheer and require a cami - this one does not which is key for those of us that live in hot climates. don't miss out!",pos
"There isn't a whole lot that i did like about this dress. the shoulders have large poufs, the fabric isn't very soft, and it's not flattering. maybe with a belt i could be tempted, but i wasn't too fond of the dress.",neg
"Great dress! i am always looking for knee length dresses that are comfortable and easy to wear. i am really active with my kids and this dress can be worn on a casual day with sandals or dressed up. the fit was flattering for me, although i am not very curvy and could see that it might not flatter all shapes. i am 5'5'' and 120 pounds and the size four fit great.",pos
Received this top as a gift from a friend with great taste. found fabric to have high quality feel and texture and it fit quite well. love how the flutter layer creates a different look.,pos

"This is a true retailer dress, cute and quirky. kudos for the built-in liner (with scalloped hem, very pretty) and pockets. i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress, and the white background makes the colors and details really pop (pun intended!). i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips. i?m 5?2?, and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees). but when i tried on size 6,",pos
"This jacket doesn't look all that special in the photos provided. i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on. it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with 80s power suits. i call this look: ""full sigourney weaver"" and it is marvelous! perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa 1988. so happy with this purchase. highly recommend!",pos
I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.,neg
"This top is very pretty and figure-flattering because of the way it nips in under the bust. the neckline and color are also flattering. however, it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust, balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area. there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off. i wound up not buying it due to the price, but i'd probably snap it on sale.",pos
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.,pos
The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering. i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting.,neg
"My friend and i both bought this in the ""white"" color in our usual sizes. the fabric is soft, the neckline is flattering and the drawstring is cute. hides a tummy beautifully. the store had the white and the green. the green color looks very different in person than it does online. in person, it is darker and more of a soft emerald green--not the pale green-gray pictured online.",pos
"Wish they had more colors in these pants. the dark grey is very nice, but i'd definitely take another color if offered. very cute pants. a fantastic deal at the sale price. but size down! they run a full size too big.",pos
"I cannot say enough excellent things about these jeans...they fit beautifully, have just enough stretch and sit high enough on my waist to cover any unsightly rolls. this was my first pilcro purchase, and i will definitely be adding other styles to my closet in the near future. typically, i'm a size 32 or 14 in denim, but i sized down to a 31 in these after the sales associate made that suggestion. i'm so glad i did...they are a perfect fit!",pos

This color rich pattern will transition nicely into the fall season. it wears well with a bare leg and will look great with opaque tights later in the season. the higher waist and gathering work well on my figure.,pos
"Hei hei is my favorite line. i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brand.
i ordered these in the green and they arrived today. they fit me as if they were an xxl. i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same. 
obviously they are going back tomorrow . i'm very disappointed, they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty.",neg
This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.,pos
I'm so glad i trusted my instincts and decided not to size down on this luxurious dress since my body type is so different from the previous reviewers.  size small would have surely cut off my circulation around my shoulders.  i bought mp since i have thick arms/shoulders/back and i'm short 135# 38-27-35.   my only gripe is how skinny and insubstantial the straps are so maybe i'll get those changed.  i'm tempted to buy the other color since this dress is so beautiful but i really don't nred it!,pos
"Very comfortable, but ran small. great quality and great look.",pos
"I love the style and quality of this skirt. the material is a bit heavier than anticipated, so it works well in cooler months, and the thickness makes it easy to wear a shirt underneath. it fits true to size - my usual 6 is form-fitting without being overly snug or pulled.

i am on the taller side, and the skirt is fairly long - it comes to the bottom of my knee.",pos
"I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer. i was given this in a s, but it wasn't even close to meeting in the front, so i returned it for a m. it doesn't button anyway, but i didn't want it to look like it wouldn't meet at all. i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store, and it fit perfectly, so this one is just running small. overall, i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater.",pos
I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person.,pos

"This is ruching done right! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well.

it is fitted, but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places. it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything. so unless this particular color is your nemesis, this dress is a winner!",pos
"I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it. i felt it ran a little big. i'm a 34dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the ""girls"" but a small fit me and fit well. i didn't find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders. i paid full price but i loved it so much i didn't mind. the sale price is amazing!",pos
"Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2"" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!",pos

"I just purchased this adorable drop waist dress on-line and personally found it to fit tts in my regular size small (34d-27-35). the length in the front hits right to the top of my knees, perhaps a tad longer so it's not too short for me (i'm only 5'4"") and the back is longer in length. there is also a detachable matching cotton slip that snaps on or off the dress that has adjustable straps that hit just above my knees. i love that this dress was made from cotton and the color is just as picture",pos

I got this at the sale price and it fits great. the bottom was wrinkled so it was not as open at the end like the picture but i am sure an iron will help.,pos
"This vest is much silkier than the pictures online show, which was a great surprise. the cut of this vest is beautiful and it can be worn so many ways!",pos
Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.,pos

will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops.",pos
I get the great reviews. these do for me what no jogger could. i have hips. i never thought these would work. they do and they look just as cool on me as the model. i am a 10-12. i could only find a 12 but i think a 10 would be perfect. they are effortlessly cool and casual...for all body types. i'm so excited i tried these on.,pos
"This top is so cute and of spectacular quality, but you have to size up! i'm a 10/m/34c all the time. i almost never have to size up or down. but this top was so tight around the bust that i couldn't possibly have closed the zipper in the back. i'm sending it back for a l in the hopes of a better fit. the coloring of the owls is out-of-this-world cute, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed that a larger size will be just right.",pos
"Looks exactly as it does in the pictures. very comfortable, loose flowing, and has a slip underneath it. i'm personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because it's always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size. with that, i have wide hips/big thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large, but thankfully the medium fits like a glove!",pos

"Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured, so the top looks better on me when the silk part isn't under my boobs. kinda have",pos
"As a mom, items in my wardrobe that are easy to throw on in a flash, comfortable to run around in with my kids, and still look like i took some time putting together my outfit are priceless. these fit the bill on all counts. they look fantastic with a pair of booties and a light, flowing top.

these have to be the most comfortable joggers ever made.",pos
"This is a pretty dress, but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however, the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down, which lends to a rather unflattering look.",neg
"At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette. the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because, in person, the shirt fits like a circus tent. without exaggeration, there is a surplus of about 16 inches.

the material is still beautiful. and because of that, i haven't decided whether i'll return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner, more fitted shape.",neg
"This sweater is much more brilliant in person. the photo online doesn't do it justice. a couple of things, the faux fur collar is removable and it is attached with buttons of the same color as the sweater. the color is also more buttery than it appears. it hits right at the hip, which is so nice for wearing with dresses or skinny jeans and boots for a night out. i am 5'3"", 108 pounds and the xs hit me at hipline and was roomy without being oversized. it's really fun and festive with the collar,",pos

Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.,pos
"I like the weight of this sweater. it breathes a little but the knit isn't too thin. it is a little see-through, so i like to stick to solids underneath it. it's just a cleaner look than seeing pattern peeking through. great rose color.",pos
Love this jacket!got my usual size medium and is perfect! beautiful quality,pos
"I love everything about this dress. the coloring, fabric and flow of it. it's so much better in person than on-line. it's true to size and very comfortable. a great price as well.",pos
"The perfect pair. i am 5'6"". 130lb, and ordered size 28, and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy, so molds to your shape. the legs are slender, but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt.",pos
"Buy these, they are a keeper. sturdy fabric, not too thin and they do not sag or stretch after wearing (i tested them before taking the tag off by sitting in them on my couch for several hours). comfy, soft fabric. i will be ordering other colors, hoping that black will be available.",pos
"I also found this blouse fits well and runs true to size. a size 2 was perfect, not too tight and not too full. the umbrellas and raindrops are so cute and bright. i will wear with jeans or dressier slim pants. what fun!",pos
"In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable, and the pockets are always nice.",pos
This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it!,pos
I purchased this jumpsuit for christmas parties this year and have received so many compliments. it's a great fit and very comfortable. i especially love the pockets! very flattering.,pos
"Perfect summer dress: feminine, cool, with just the right flow. hides the bad, and has a nice shape.",pos
This top is just lovely. the bow on the back is so unusual. i am so glad i bought it!!! i washed it on gentle and it turned out great!!!,pos
"I am a true size 6 in virtually everything, pants or dress. i was swimming in these! i am reordering a size 2, they were so big.",pos
"Fits great. structured, but still comfy. figure flattering.",pos
This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular. it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliquã©s and embroidery make this very slimming. as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high. i won't be raising my arms much wearing this. the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes. i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until i'm sure i'm not tangl,pos
"These embroidered jeans are very nice. they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better. the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans. i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you. i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery. these jeans are loose and expand with wear, it is perfectly ok to size down.",pos
"I love everything about this sweater. it is very well made, beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together. it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one, but none are left. i am 5 ft. tall and weigh about 96 pounds. i can wear a 0 but not in this sweater. it runs very well and i highly recommend it. hope they make more in this style. it is so fresh looking and so comfortable.",pos
"Lots of embellishment, striking magenta color, feels great on, with a flattering neckline that isn't too low. i recommend it!",pos
"This dress looks way better on you than sitting on the hanger! the design really flatters your body and the waist area, makes you look very skinny! highly recommend! the length is also perfect, just the right length for a maxi dress, long enough but short enough to show off your shoes as well!",pos
"Besides being my favorite color to wear, this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume. the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles. the fit is not what i'm used to, because it fits in a 1940s type of way, and when i took it to my tailor, she ensured me that it is the perfect fit. the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces, but is perfect for a night out.",pos
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion, totally worth the price. it's very, very well made and fits perfectly. i usually wear a size 4 but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist, i size down to 2 so they fit properly. i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove. i'm 5'11"" and the skirt comes to mid-calf on me which is exactly what i was looking for. love love love this skirt, i totally recommend it.",pos
"I wanted to like this dress, but it just did not work for a bustier frame. the fabric is quite loose, does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy, so if you are well-endowed, your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs. as a result, the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips (as on the model), and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward. on smaller curves, this would likely be very flattering, but",neg
"A really beautiful, well made dress. runs extremely big though! i'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i'm positively swimming in it. an oversized look works for this particular dress, but i think it's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style.",pos
Love the wash and fit of this jean. the perfect summer go to for me.,pos
"I'm a big fan of maeve products. still, even when i like something, i always prefer to try on in the store just to be certain. i decided to risk it this time and was so happy when this top came and it fit perfectly. i'm 5'3, 150 lbs but carry more weight on bottom so i ordered the 8. it's just right--cute and flowy. i'll probably get another one in a different color!",pos
"Color, style, adjustability, easy fit, flattering!  yes on so many levels!  oh wait it's on sale!  fantastic, magnificent and pretty!  i bought medium and in 39-28-35",pos
From the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it. the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful. it is even prettier in person than it is online!!,pos
"Oh how i love this dress! i was worried because i am very busty and sometimes that translated to looking pregnant in swing dresses, but this.... incredible! i am wearing it with either blue strappy sandals or red heels and it is quite the perfect summer dress! the material is thick, and feels elegant, the colors are vibrant. today is my first day wearing it, and i have already received 4 compliments! no kidding! wonderful! maeve clothing... i love you!",pos
"I bought this in the store without trying it in the black. when i put it on, i loved it. so much so that i went back and purchased the black patterned one. equally as nice.",pos
The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.,pos
"This romper is so cute and comfy! the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots (true to the photos). i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso, but this fits great, with shorts hitting about the same as the model image (i'm 5'7""). i really love the v-neck on this too - it's simple, but a really flattering cut that i don't think would expose even ladies with a larger chest. definitely a nice everyday piece - excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa",pos
"I tried this shirt on on a whim in my local store when i was there to shop the sale items an to my surprise, it was very flattering and comfortable. it had a unique fit and design; i tried on the black in an xs (my usual size) and surprisingly, i didn't find it to be too big at all. it fit just like it did on the model. you could almost wear it as a mini dress over leggings/shorts based on the length. like one of the previous reviewers, it would be great if it came in other colors. this top woul",pos
Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.,pos
"I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag, no fit , no drape
very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale, it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.",neg
"I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear, i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper, outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants weren't tight at all, but the seams wren't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these.",neg
"A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim, orange, reds , etc. very happy with this purchase.",pos
"Love this sweater. one of my favorite fall purchases by far. love how it hangs - especially the low back. it's simple, comfortable yet so chic at the same time. i bought the grey and goes great with skinny jeans and boots.",pos
"The first day i wore this jacket to work, three people told me how great it looked. it's stylish but comfy, looks great worn with a tunic and leggings or accompanying a skirt and tights. best of all, the camel color is a great change from black and as a bonus, doesn't show my orangeish lab's dog hair!",pos
"Great dress! wish it came it more colors, would like to buy another one. i am 5'5"",125, size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers, i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital, cute with a jean jacket, or long lightweight scarf, booties, or sandals! .",pos
"I love this dress--i saw it on the way out of the store and was struck by the gorgeous color and rich velvet fabric and had to touch it and then try it on. i did not find it to be tight in the shoulders at all, nor do i think it looks cheap--on the contrary. the shape is indeed boxy, but it is still very flattering and comfortable. i wore it to a christmas brunch and got a ton of compliments. the only drawback for me is that it has to be dry cleaned. for reference, i am 5'6 1/2"" and usually wear",pos
"I'd been eyeing this skirt on the website, and was pleasantly surprised to find one hanging on the sale rack in a local store. i couldn't leave it behind. the silver embroidery and the lovely, flowinng weight of the tulle layers make this a beautiful skirt. i'm just over 5"" 4"" and it skims the floor on me with a 2"" heel. can't wait to wear it!",pos
"I love this sweater. i purchased it in the red/berry color. it is so incredibly soft and cozy and the fit is fantastic! it hugs my curves in all the right places! i purchased it without even looking at the care instructions. but, after reading a couple of reviews here, i opted to wash on delicate and line dry. it came out perfectly!",pos
I am obsessed with the quality of the fabric on this top. i am giving it as a gift and can't wait!!!!,pos
This is a great dress for those days where you just want to throw something on but still look put together. it hangs so well and feels so comfortable yet it has a style that is a combination of bohemian and part sophisticated . the colors are muted but they work so well. i wear it with flat strap sandals and have also paired it with wedges. i receive tons of compliments and have to make sure my daughter doesn't try to borrow it. would highly recommend.,pos
"I wasn't sure what to expect with these pants. i couldn't figure out from the pictures what the material would actually be like. is it jersey? is it french terry? is it more traditional sweatshirt-type material? nope, turns out, they're like wearing pants made out of a fuzzy, flecked sweater. or like the thickest, loosest sweater-knit tights ever. surprise! they are the strangest pants i've ever owned, for sure, but i actually really like them. they're super comfortable and cozy warm. slightly i",pos
"Colors are much brighter in person, fits well (not frumpy like a lot of open-front sweaters). colors make it perfect for neutrals but maybe hard to mix with other colors. pricey, so still considering whether to keep it.",pos
"I ordered this in the peach color way. it is a nice, thicker cotton and while i have only worn & washed once (i air dried) it feels like a fabric that will hold up well. fit is good, i stuck with my usual medium. at first i thought it was a little big but i didn't want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small. in the body a small would have worked i am sure, so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well. i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in",pos
"After reading the reviews, i decided to order this top. i was so pleased, and when i wore it for the first time, i had someone ask me where i got it. it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back. i want to order it again in different colors.",pos
One of the sales women was wearing this today. she looked amazing. then i tried on. i looked really great. the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person. it is comfy - 97% cotton. the unique hem adds punch. able to dress up or down. i'm a true size 6. small fits perfectly. medium was very loose and oversized. well constructed. feels more like a $98 ($78 retail) pullover. highly recommend.,pos
This bra surprised me by how good it looks on. the placement of the lace and cups creates a flattering silhouette.,pos
"Love the lace back panel, unique design. would not call this blue....definitely more of a grey color, but it is pretty! got size small and it fit well. 5'6"" 140 lbs.",pos
"I bought this in the neutral motif and my expectations before trying it on weren't high but i was sold once i was in the dress. sometimes dresses that have the elastic band in the waist can be tricky if you don't have a perfectly flat tummy and can accentuate the tiniest bump. however, this dress sits perfectly on the waist and is actually super slimming. i wasn't 100% sold on the pattern or color (i wish it was more off white than brown) but the fit was so great that i had to buy it! the dress",pos
"Lovely jumpsuit. can be dressed up or down. i agree with the other reviewers that in my normal medium, the torso length is a bit short, making the garment pull. i sized up to a large, and with room in the hips and the correct torso length, the jumpsuit works. the bust is cut for a smaller gal. for reference, i am 5'7"", 36a, 155lb.",pos
"I've had my eye on this dress ever since i saw it in a fall catalog. my daughter's name is tegan and this is exactly the style i love - simple. when it went on sale i was lucky enough to find it in the green color i wanted at a great price. it is so soft and comfortable, yet flattering. it's a must have. now i want to get this in black!",pos
"Just a wonderful shirt -- fabric is so soft, it feels like pajamas, and the blue is just perfect. there's a different blue plaid as a lining, and i almost wish it was reversible. they're both great patterns! wonderful for fall...",pos
I got this shirt in red plaid and love it. super cute without being too trendy. i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments.,pos
"I just got this in the mail and wore it for the first time today. it is a beautiful top, the crochet portion of it is very well made and overall the top hangs nicely. the linen though is a little bit rough and scratchy. the lining underneath seems a little delicate and is not stretchy so i felt at moments while sitting that i could have just ripped it with one wrong move. the linen also wrinkles pretty easy in the mid-belly section so there is an ugly line going across, a problem with a lot of l",pos
"I saw this dress in the store and was drawn to the pattern as an alternative to my normal lbd. it looked okay on the hanger, but when i tried it on...wow! so pretty and chic. it actually hangs a little lower in the front on me than on the model pictured which adds to the chicness and makes it a sophisticated take on a kimono. (my husband's words) i wore it out that evening to dinner and received several compliments. i did not have any issues with fit. i am a size 6 and purchased a size 6. it fit",pos
"What a disappointment and for the price, it's outrageous!",neg
"The fabric is really soft and the cardi has a cute and comfy slouchy, loose fit. reminds me of free people cardis with the extra long sleeves and loose fit. great to throw on over workout clothes or with jeans and a tee shirt. easy piece. would size down. i'm getting lots of use out of it.",pos
"This looked so odd on me! i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too. the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom. the top is really large, as to be unflattering. perhaps it's just that it doesn't work on someone who is petite, but this one is a return.",neg
"I am 5'4, so i feel i'm on the cusp of petite/regular sizing. i ordered 2p, (about 125-130lbs), and the dress fit perfectly. it's so pretty (i got blue), i ordered this for my upcoming trip for our anniversary...i feel like i can wear with sandals or heels, with leggings or no leggings. beautifully made. kind of pricey, but worth it.",pos
"Very comfortable dress, with a gorgeous pattern. it comes with a self liner in navy that is very smoothing - i was worried a figure hugging sweater knit would be unflattering. cut is perfect. i'm a size 10/12 on top and 12/14 on bottom, and the m was the best fit. the neckline is a deep scoop so if you are not busty it may come down too far for comfort.",pos
"I ordered this on a whim as i though, hey, i don't have off the shoulder tops let's try ti, looks cute...
i ordered the nude after debating, but glad i did, it is a bit warmer in color, and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin. teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it (maybe i am seeing things). it is soft, not sure there is wool, i am not that sensitive to wool, felt soft to me.

size: i ordered the xxs as i think lately, retailer has been making things baggier, and on a shorter pe",pos
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. the fabric is light and comfortable. the colors are even more vibrant in person. it has a keyhole opening in front, which might not be for everyone, but which i really liked. the only things i would caution buyers about, is that it is not lined, and for shorter buyers (i'm 5' 3"") it runs a bit long, so if you can pick up the petite, that might mean a better fit.",pos
"I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift, blouson when cinched, or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads, sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d",pos
"I love this tank. i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue. this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle. it's fitted without being too tight. i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great! i'm not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy, casual piece. i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer.",pos
"I got this top on a fantastic deal - it is comfortable, fits well (slightly large to size, but i prefer that), and really on-trend. such a great staple i bought in the other colorway as well.",pos
Beautiful. elegant. sexy. i love the fit. can be dressed up or wear with jeans. it's great!,pos
"Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans, i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough, you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft, super cute!",pos
"This top is unique and gorgeous! i'm a singer and i knew i had to have it for an upcoming performance. it's got a really great ethnic/bohemian beauty and femininity to it. i saw the top on-line, then i went to the store to try it on. it is delicate- it has beading, embroidery and mesh, so one has to be careful putting on jackets, brushing up against things, etc. but it's well worth it. please note that due to the lining, it does run small, i had to go up a size. depending on how you'd like it to",pos
"This is truly a beautiful top. the beading and lace are subtle, but add such a special, feminine touch. i love the breezy, swingy shape. very flattering. this is one item i will be sure to treasure for years to come. love!!",pos
"I know i'm going to get a lot of wear out of this t-shirt this summer. i have it in white, and it's not too see through, which is what i always worry about when i wear white shirts. it's basic but then it has lace on the shoulders that adds something extra. i love its drape--it's not too form fitting. on me (i'm 5'2), it tends to be a bit long, but i like it. the shirt being cotton means that it's super soft. as far as washing goes, best practice is to machine wash and hang to dry--i'm afraid of",pos
I loved these pants. they fit perfectly. and then i washed them. like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them. the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns. so sad.  wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right?,neg
"I tried this dress at the store and fell in love with it but they only had the red dress (my size). trust me, the red is absolutely beautiful but i needed a black dress so i purchased it online. i just can't wait for it to arrive!
it fits perfectly and it's so classy.",pos
"When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!",pos
"I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5"" and 120 lbs and the small is just right.",pos
"This dress is so cute and comfortable! it can be dressed up or down, super versatile. love it!",pos
"Amazingly soft, thin and super warm! this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny!",pos
The blouse is as shown in the picture. it falls nicely and is flattering to wear. the detail on the yoke and hemline is of good quality. i've received a lot of compliments on this top.,pos
Really cute over my white cropped pilcro jeans. or as a beach cover up over a bathing suit. i want this in more colors!,pos
"Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey.",pos
"Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out
after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more
dressy than a regular legging.",pos
"The color is as pictured. good quality. it's lined. the zipper in the back makes it look updated. i ordered my usual size. small petite size 6. it fit perfectly. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs. hourglass figure. i had high hopes. i have hips and short, heavy legs. the skirt only emphasized my flaws. if you've got great legs you will do well with this. i do own other short skirts. but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal. if you're on the fence give it a try. it",neg
"I tried the red/salmon color on at the store. it's a very bright color, but a nice one. the top is form-fitting, with soft stretchy material. there are two small buttons at each shoulder. the sleeves are a good length. the boatneck shows a little bit of bra strap, but not too noticeable. the only thing i didn't care for was the somewhat synthetic look of the material. if you're between sizes, size up as it's a snug fit.",pos
I wasn't sure if this dress would hang correctly on me and make me look shapeless but i'm so happy with it! the fabric is so comfortable and the tie in the back really helps draw it in so my waist is defined. the length is great and it's super comfortable but looks polished!,pos
"This sweater is adorable and comfortable, but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything. i cannot even imagine trying to wash it. unfortunately, i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor.",neg
This is my new favorite shirt. i'm actually wearing it today! i had to order another in white too. grab it while you can!,pos
"Just got both today, skirt and top, and i love how soft the material is. and btw, i learned a valuable lesson from past moth sweater purchases, dry clean; even though the ""how to care for"" tag states hand-washing, d.r.y. clean. the last moth sweater i washed was not in the same shape it was when i first purchased, but i never made that mistake again ;) and it was one of my faves!

i bought this particular top in the large as i wanted the ""boyfriend"" oversized look, and i love the way it drapes o",pos
I love this dress! it is super cute and swingy. a perfect summer dress - dress it up or even for a fun summer afternoon with sandals. the fit is great (the armholes on the regular 0 were a little big. the 0petite is much better),pos
"I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves one. this top is completely, utterly, adorable! it flows so beautifully, which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party, and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand, and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!",pos
"I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.",neg
"I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style, the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased.",pos
Gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things. lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee (that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!,pos
"This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with, it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.",pos
"Here's an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term 'petite' on it. too much fabric, was bulky, and ran too small. the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust. returned..",neg
This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly,pos
"This is a super flattering, cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute, casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!",pos
"My husband bought it for me and i was a bit skeptical at first. tried it on and absolutely loved it. besides the really soft fabric, it has pockets which makes it even more comfortable for me! i'm 5'8"", 123lbs. and flat chested. he got me a medium, which fits a bit tight, but my husband likes it so it's a keeper!",pos
"I really liked this top. ordered the blue and am considering getting the pink color. 5'4, 135lbs, ordered xxs and it fit great. has nice drape around hips and not too snug.",pos
"First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.

second of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.

not at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i'm sure i will find something to exchange it for!",neg
"Love the color pattern, tiny gold buttons, flattering fit, quality of fabric and make.  i got size 4 petite, which fits perfectly. my husband said they looked really good on me and were keepers! i'm 5'2"", 115#.  highly recommend .",pos
What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.,pos
Love the easy fit of this dress. great for work or family events. love the ribbed sleeves and pockets are a plus!,pos
"I debated getting this dress for over a month and finally purchased it on retailer member day for 20%off. i wore it on a chiller night with a denim jacket and booties for a more casual feel. constant compliments from friends and strangers. 

only complaint about the dress is the slit. it does not go as high like on the model, stops right at the knee.the cross over is not too revealing (which is nice). overall the fit is great! im 5&#39;6 and usually size 12 and 36dd, the large was perfect!",pos
"I'm not usually a fan of tees as i'm a little but busty, and don't like material that clings. the color of this tee is gorgeous, though. the neckline is feminine, and it has it enough weight that it moves.
not sure how it'll wash, but will try to keep it out of the dryer.",pos
"I usually wear a s petite so that's what i initially got in this. i'm 5'2"", 32c-27-36. the shoulders were about an inch too wide on either side, the sides along the top had tons of extra fabric (almost like batwings or a dolman cut) and the waist was at least 6"" too big! i'm re-ordering in petite xs and hoping for the best, because this is a gorgeous coat.",pos
"The pictures do not do this dress justice. this dress is gorgeous, the color is beautiful, and it is so flattering on. even better, this dress is machine washable! simply hang it up to dry and it looks like it is fresh from the cleaners. i love this dress so much i don't even mind that i purchased it at full price, and now it is on sale. buy this dress for a special occasion -- it is so special.",pos
This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.,pos
"I love, love, love this top! the cutout pattern in front is such a unique look and is a great way to add some fun to your usual t-shirt and jeans look. it's well made and the fit is great. i got it in petite s which worked great length-wise.",pos

"I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and ""slips"" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s",pos
"Maeve does not disappoint! unlike many of the tops and dresses which recently have been billowy, a bit shapeless, and not form-fitting, this hugs all the right curves. it's adorable, eye-catching and the pattern is so cute. i paired it with nude heels today and a jacket - so fun. just like the wynwood top in all 4 colors, the level of fun and playfulness is unmatched. it's tts. i am 5'4"" 115 and got the 2. thank you, retailer & thank you, maeve!",pos
"These pants are so comfy i'm getting a second pair. i ordered the olive color in a small/reg, im thinking of ordering the xs next time since they do stretch out a great deal as the day goes on. would definitely recommend these for sure. hope this review is helpful as i struggled with ordering petite or not. glad i didn't!",pos
Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it's one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i'm only 5'2 and i wouldn't want it to be any shorter.,pos
"Retailer is my favorite store!  they always have everything i want and more.  these pants are absolutely beautiful and intricate in design and the quality is fantastic.  it's stylish and a pair of pants that i will always use and that will last for anlobn time. and how can i forget, these pants are slimming",pos

I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.,pos
I can only review the ivory as that was the only color in my local store. this sweater is very flattering as it is fitted on top but has a nice flow over the hips plus the zipper allows for more room or to show off an underlying top. the material is soft and the ivory is very pretty in person.,pos
"I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish, but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online, and the fabric is so soft, it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely, and so it's flattering. overall, a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe.",pos
"I'm 5' 5"", 150 lbs, 32dd, normally a 28p or 29p in pants. i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering?the print was overwhelming for my pale skin, it made my thin waist look larger than it really was, and rode up the inside of my thighs. i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering. if you have thick legs, this may not be the suit for you. i returned it--so fast.",neg
"I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l",pos
"This skirt is beautiful, i even have the perfect shirt to wear with it, sadly, though, i have to decide between too many nice things... what to do! i tried on the 0, and it fits me perfectly. above the knee, waist just right (26.5 in). colors are fun and great for fall, but could also summer-ize the skirt.fabric is thick, however, and well-made. i highly recommen, but leave a 0 for me!",pos
"I ordered this in a petite (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size 4p fits perfectly) and it fits very well everywhere. however, i think if you're bigger than 34b, size up, because this top is very fitted around the bust. the bottom hem falls right below my belly button, the neckline is not too low and not too high. i chose black because i feel that there are a lot of details and can be toned down with a darker color. i think this top must be fitted for a tailored look, or otherwise one may risk t",pos
Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.,pos
Love these shorts! fit true to size and the material is so amazing.,pos
"Like the previous reviewer stated, it's more like a cape. i'd to call it a cape-digan. style: super comfy, loose fit for comfort. fabric: high quality, just right thickness (not too thick, not too thin), snuggly soft, doesn't pill with wear. design: totally retailer cute and quirkiness, top of the back has the same gray as the sleeve for continuity, and the sleeve has sheep and a fence (how cute is that!). this is a very versatile sweater, goes with everything, and so comfortable that i reach for",pos
"I've been buying and returning several denim shorts lately searching for the right pair. these are fantastic. they are so so soft and comfy. i'd say they run slightly big but not to the point where i needed to size down like i do with the hyphen chinos. love that they are not so short but not too long either and can be adjusted by how you roll them. these are a nice medium wash and i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and went w my normal size 26. seems like they may stretch out a little but that's ok bc then they",pos

"I'm 5'3, with a 32h chest. ive always had a hard time finding clothes that fit well because i'm chest heavy. this fits perfectly without making me look bigger than i am and hides my post pregnancy pooch well!

"This tee has the cutest details and the green is actually a beautiful, deeper green. the shirt has a great fit and looks so much more flattering on than the pictures show. (5'4"" 109# got an xs, slightly loose, exactly how i like it.) the somewhat mottled/dye type color makes it a casual piece for me; great with jeans. nice fabric, thickness.",pos
"I love this shirt! red + navy is one of my fave color combos, and the vintage feel is fantastic. the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting, but it's a good thing. the top isn't heavy, but the knit gives it more texture & interest.
this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look...covered, but form-fitting and flattering.",pos
"I thought this dress looked cute online and was excited to try it on at my local retailer. it fits so well and is very flattering! i really like the material. 

the only thing for me is that i have long arms so the sleeves have to get pushed up, but it looks like that's how it's supposed to be.",pos
I got the blue and love the color. it's bigger than it looks here! almost like the model has it pinned in the back...but it's swingy and super cute and fun!!,pos
"I saw this blouse and had to have it. i ordered my usual size large and was shocked at how big it was. it looked like a maternity top on me, so i sized down to medium. it fit much better and i was able to fully appreciate how gorgeous the colors were and how feminine and pretty the mock neck was. i definitely recommend it, but suggest to size down for a better fit.",pos
"I saw this in the store and was glad i didn't order it earlier online. i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person. i like more unusual and flattering pieces, and this just wasn't it. no compliments here.",neg
I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,pos
"This is a very nice turtleneck. the variations in the ribbing are a modern (and flattering) touch. in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations - fyi there are not. all the ribbing areas are the same shade of black.

"This is a perfect sweater. it's comfortable, practical and lends an elegant hand to a pair of jeans. it also hides your bits and stays flattering. i have worn it a lot because it makes life so easy and i have not had any issues yet with lace tearing.

it is of exceptional materials and quality construction. the juxtaposition of the stripes against the beautifully vibrant embroidery on back is stunning! it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! my size medium came in the european size 38. for reference, i am an american size 8-10.

"When this dressed first debuted, i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall. then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this. this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi. and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters. add a wide leather belt when it's opened or closed, works great either way. when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum, i knew this would be an ideal pair",pos
So soft and comfortable!,pos

"I love, love this trench! i bought the grey, and it goes well with so many other pieces! i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend. it's a great layering piece for the san francisco weather i'm adjusting to!

it does run a little big, but i don't mind because it gives enough room for layering. i'm short at 5'3 but still stuck with a small-- a small petite probably would look great as well!

"I've been looking for colored pants and these are the best!

i am typically a 10 or 12 in pants and the 30 fit well. i tried on the rose color and loved those. the fit was great, though they wouldn't be long enough on me if i tried to unroll them (though you can). i liked how they fit my butt, hips and thighs, which is usually the most important part. i find that lots of colored pants accentuate the cellulite on my thighs too much, but that was not at all the case with these.

"This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.",pos
Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.,pos

"I got this dress on sale (under 20 dollars) but i would pay more!  it runs very large - i got a medium which is roomy, irl i wear a large (vanity sizing i suppose!).  the colors are so pretty, it is lined so you don't need a slip or cami.  highly recommend!",pos
I loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.,pos
"I bought this dress because it was cute, swinging and lightweight -- seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer. after on wash and dry, the dress is already ripped around two buttons. i'll still wear it but i don't think it'll last until next summer. kind of pitiful since it wasn't a cheap-o dress. also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point.",neg
I bought this jacket in white specifically for summer. it is the perfect weight for the office air conditioning coolness. i wore this jacket with a sleeveless silk blouse and summer skirt. it just looked perfect for a dressier summer outfit. i take a m/l in retailer jackets and went with the large in this because i have a large bust (36d). the medium fit but was just a tad snug through my upper back/front area. the large gave me a little wiggle room so i could wear a little heavier blouse undernea,pos

"Very high quality fabric and the fit is excellent. the skirt is stylish yet simple and very easy to wear as i feel i would have no trouble paring it with several different tops. it can easily be dressed up or down and is excellent for work. i got this on sale and am so glad, still, it is one of the few items actually worth the initial high price tag. great quality!",pos

I love the fabric and design of this dress. you will definitely get noticed. and it's comfortable - just slip it on and go!,pos
"This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing, even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high, it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely, not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6",pos

I tried this on in the store and had to have it. this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand. i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything. i'm a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items. it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves. i highly recommend it!!,pos

"The cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined. although the color is beautiful, the cheap fabric has no variation, is too saturated, and lacks any sheen of quality silk. 
shocked at the price. i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre 2010 . being back the quality!",neg
"Great fit. love the mid rise! my usual size 28 in these leggings hug in all the right places. they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt 1"" below my ankles. i may have them hemmed after they're washed. just wait & see... 5'3"" 117#",pos
I found this fit tts for me. i'm normally a 10/12 and took a 12. fit and length are great. the fabric felt substantial and the colors are soft.,pos
"I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,",pos
Love the blouse and the best part is the back side ! this brand never ceases to fall short for fit and style. try it on to see,pos
Fits perfect!,pos
"This can be worn now on its own or as the weather gets colder it will make a great layering piece
i bought one and liked it so much i bought it in another color",pos

the dress runs extremely large and has no shape.... looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moo...moo in it!
this will be going back to the store!!!!",neg
Awesome basic top for your wardrobe. it's a little sheer but not too much.,pos
"Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i'm pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier.",neg
I love this top and it's so pretty in person.  knew it would be full but was hoping it wouldn't be too big.  it's perfect and looks good with jeans.,pos
"I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch (very retailer). it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. i'd love to see more styling options for this top because i'm a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha.",pos
This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.,pos
"The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer, but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4"" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.",neg
This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.,pos
Love this top. ..especially the back. the back makes the whole top.,pos
"When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement.",neg
"This is a fun and classic dress. the dress is well made, as others said, it doesn't have much ""give"".  i am a 36c, 29"", 39""- and the size 8 fit perfectly. i didn't experience any gapping between the buttons. it is a nice fun summer time dress! it is also very flattering!",pos

"What a great top! i am 5'9"" - 136 lbs with a 34d chest.. and this top looks and feels great on. i am usually a 6 and the small fit perfectly. i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color. the v in front hits in a great spot.. not too low, but just low enough to look feminine. i haven't washed and dried the top yet, so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new. i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews, but i find this top really works for me, so i am glad",pos
"The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice. the inner layer is sheer but as long as you're wearing a nude-colored bra, no big deal. however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy. they must've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top, because it looks like it hangs straight on her. i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package, it clearly flares out & is a-line. so as a previous reviewer stated, it looks huge from the front. if it had fit the",neg

This dress is absolutely like a layered cloud! the material is amazingly soft and comfy.,pos
This dress looks and feels classy and expensive! every time i wear it out i get compliments on the color and style.,pos
"I loved how soft this dress was, as well as versatile. however, i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash, a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately, the fabric is so soft, but rather thin, and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be",neg
"Gorgeous, color, fabric, and cut. i ordered the blue in a 14. i always wear a 14p or large petite in retailer. i purchased a regular 14. it's a full size too small in the ribcage. cannot zip it up.. i'll be exchanging mine for next size up. even though i'm 4'11"", the length is fine. if you're tall, it might be pretty short for you.",pos
"I tried the red version at store, it fit really good and i loved it. then i found the blue version online and liked even more. it can be worn for business and casual.",pos
I love this top. i had no issues with fabric. it is soft and light. the wrist details are very pretty. i love the buttons. it fits true to size and it is a good layering top. i got the red which is true to the picture. not looking red but a bright coral color.,pos
"I don't understand the negative review
on this sweater. it is nothing short of stunning. the quality and design are absolutely beautiful! and i love the lined pockets! i can honestly say i don't think i'll ever part with it - this is a sweater you hang onto forever. i will say it runs a bit large. i ordered the xs/sm and if i didn't know better i would think its m/l. either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online, do it! it is worth every penny, especially for the s",pos
"I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person, it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois (""shammy"" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that's what it felt lik",neg
"I've been trying to find a pair of tasteful destroyed jeans for the summer. i'm also petite. i love paige jeans already, since the ankle length has worked very well on me. i saw these jeans in store, tried them on, and loved them. like other paige jeans they don't stretch out (especially if you size down - but even then, you don't get that ""sausage"" feeling of wearing pants that are too small - the material stretches in the waste).",pos
This is a great quality product with unique design,pos
"I just bought this dress in the store and i love it. i'm in my 50s and it does every thing i need a dress to do. it has sleeves, it's modest enough and shows my shape. the colors are great and go with most shoes. i'm heading to italy soon and this one will see me through many museums and churches. great buy!",pos
"This shirt is very flattering, which is not the case for all peplum tops. v-neck is appropriate for work. looks great with jeans or khakis. highly recommend! only con is that the material is quite thin. 5'3"" 115 lbs and xs fit perfectly.",pos
I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!,pos
"I purchased this top in white. it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath. i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one, i purchased the xs, but wish i had bought a s. the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons. for reference, i am 5'6, weigh 128 lbs, 34b bra size, 28 jean size, and small boned. i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist. my normal weight is 110-112 lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh",pos

"These jeans immediately caught my eye online, and when i saw them in the store on display, i knew i had to at least try them on. they are absolutely adorable. i love the uniqueness of the buttons at the bottom. great fit, and great stretch. i wore them for the first time today, and i had at least four people i didn't know approach me and tell me that they liked my jeans.",pos

"This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined, but it is boxy and totally un-fitted. i swim, which means i have large shoulders, and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion, well a fat boxing champion as it has not waste-line. the sleeves are too long, and as usual, retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system, so if you choose to close this cardigan, it just looks awful.",neg

"Wow, i didn't think this dress would work on my curvy frame. i still have a baby belly and some dresses look like mumu's on me. this was so flattering, the waist cinches nicely and the length is just above the knee. i am 5.6"" and 145lbs for reference. the weight its light/cottony and it looks great with flats and wedges. 
love it!",pos
"I ordered this online and the colors are prettier in person. the blue and gray contrast nicely and have a beautiful sheen to them. i am usually a 2 at retailer and while that fit, i felt i could size down. i am slender and since it is a shift, there was little room in the waist/butt area. i ordered a 0 and that fit perfect! if you love blue (like i do), this dress is for you!",pos
"Really gorgeous print! i purchased these to go with the top (also recommend it as well) and i love these! i have a larger behind, and it's nowadays it seems to find swimsuits with full coverage without feeling like a diaper - these are it. there is elastic at the leg openings, so that may be uncomfortable for some, but i found no problem with it. for reference, i am usually a 6/8 28/29 in pants, and i purchased a medium.",pos
I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color.  ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!,pos
This is a great easy to wear summer dress. a denim jacket would look adorable to wear on a cooler night. it runs a bit small in the waist and i bought the petite because i wanted it to be above the knee summer casual. it is very flattering because of the pattern detail by the waist. it is the perfect summer dress and best of all it is machine washable!,pos

pants. i also love the ""new addition to the family"": the pilcro capri pants & would love every color of these too!",pos
"Love the crochet detail on the back. yes, it does show the bottom band of your bra. i think i'm okay with that. i had on a magenta colored bra when i tried this on and it was a nice pop of color. i think the top runs tts to slightly big. if you're in between sizes i would go down. i am a 34b and i ordered a size 4. so i haven't tried on the 2 but i think it would fit too and not be quite as loose in the arm hole area. i'm sure this top will sell out before it hits sale.",pos
"I went into the store to buy this in white after seeing it on the website. i ended up with the blue/gray color. the white was completely see thru. could have worked as a swim cover- but not at this price for me. the blue on the other hand is fine. the fabric is soft and hangs nicely. you can definitely dress it up with some booties and a belt, or keep it laid back with flip flops. i'm sure i'll wear this a bunch this summer. the color is versatile enough that i will pair with leggings and boots",pos
"This cut and fit is so good. i sized up because my body just needs that with pullovers generally, and i was glad i did. it fits just right!",pos
"Dress runs a little small, tight on top. so i had to exchange from a size 8 to a size 10. originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the 10 so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense. the material is light and soft, flowers are muted. maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute.",pos
"This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately",neg

"I love the way this top fits! i am busty on top and smaller on bottom, and it really flatters. it's funny to see it called ""off the shoulder"" b/c so far i have worn it on the shoulders. when worn on the shoulders, the neck is very flattering, kind of like a cowl neck. i probably would not wear it off the shoulder b/c of the whole bra strap challenge. i got the charcoal color which looks great with jeans or black leggings.",pos
"I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.",pos
"Gorgeous top, very nice. detail work, soft and flattering. i don't think its too full on the bottom at all - mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette. word of warning: soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink - and definitely not my color. if peach isn't flattering on you, heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly! i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade, bummer that i thought the other reviewers might",pos
"This was my first dress purchase this year, quite late. i've been disappointed with a lot of polyester/rayon/viscose dresses so far. if it's 100% silk or cotton, it's quite expensive. this dress meets all my tick marks: no synthetic, beautiful pattern, well-made, flattering to the figure. i have a silk slip so the absence of lining was not an issue for me. fits true to my petite sizing. it's a very easy to wear dress, no tugging with straps or a belt. it's slimming and skims the figure properly.",pos
The pullover is very light weight material so great for fall or spring. it hangs nicely in front and back and is slimming. i ordered a medium other than the sleeves are not as long on me as the model it fits perfectly.,pos

"When i wore this the two times i did, i got a ton of compliments. it runs small, and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning. after the second wear, the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable. i have to return it and am so disappointed. sadly, i would not recommend buying it for that reason.",neg
"I adore this dress! it's so charming. great quality, lovely fabric, beautiful color. the fit is supposed to be boxy and probably won't work on a beautiful curvy body. with a petite athletic body, i feel beautiful in it! i wear a small or xs and i definitely needed an extra small. pair it with black or camel, sandals or boots, it's lovely!",pos
"When i saw that these were on sale, i was actually going to order another pair as i have really been enjoying them and wear them quite a bit. unfortunately, the large that i take is sold out otherwise i would own two pairs. although these are called lounge pants, i put them together with white or black accessories and have worn them everywhere. since my legs are not long, i did have to shorten and they are still a bit longer on me than the model. however, it was well worth it.",pos
It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.,neg

I really loved the colors and style of this top. unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me. i'm 5'9. some mentioned they didn't like fabric but i thought it was good!,neg
This is such a simple dress to throw on that will give you instant wow factor. you can dress up or down but know that it is completely flattering - head to toe. i am in love with this dress!,pos
"I wasn't planning on loving this dress when i tried it on. i loved the the color which is what prompted me to buy it. this dress fit perfectly. it hugs my body without feeling tight. the ruching is perfect. i didn't want to take it off! it's also very comfortable.
i'm 5'1"" , 107lbs and the xs petite fit perfectly. the dress hits me at the same length that is pictured. i think it would be easy to hem if you wanted it to be shorter. i have a short torso and saw no issues with that as some reviewer",pos
Very intricate detail with stitching. love the contrast of black on cream. has slits on each side. bought it for holiday parties! just what i had hoped it would be.,pos
"I am glad to add this very versitile top to my wardrobe. it can be worn with a sweater in the cooler months (like i wore it today), a business jacket, or alone in the summer. i wore it with a fit-and-flare skirt today, but it goes with pants, jeans, shorts, etc.
fyi: i am a 36 c(34d), short waist, broad shoulders/back, size m in knit tops, 10/12 in fitted or ones with buttons. i purchased my normal size m in this top.

Great little dress for a picnic. i am a 34dd and didn't have a problem buttoning the dress unlike another previous reviewer. i had purchased a size 8. my only reason for return was the price and my wallet! otherwise this well-made dress would still be in my closet! love the buttons.,pos

i buy a lot of dresses from retailer, and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks! this dress is it!

"Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top. i was pleasantly surprised - the green is even more vibrant in person! just gorgeous. typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small. still a tad roomy but portland doesn't carry petite sizing aaaaandidon'twanttopayforshipping... remedy that, retailer portland!",pos
"If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn't just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it.",pos
"I got the purple motif and loved the colors and the feel of the fabric. i am 5'6"" and 107lbs., 32d. the small was too big and there were no xs or xxs.",pos
"This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on. great quality, fabric was lovely, just a little sparkle at the hemline, scallops were great but i put it on, i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return. love the look, it just was terrible on me. i'm petite, 5'0"" and weigh 110# so i'm not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa.",neg
"I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything. definitely runs large-i have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big (long running in the sleeves) though i was comfortable with keeping it. it's a soft, comfortable shirt. the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks/ styling. i love the shirt and i'm glad i got in on it while i did.",pos
Like the crossover design of this sweater. the v-neck is not low cut and can be worn without cami. sweater is thin but not find it to be see through although i always were tank tops under my shirts. did not find it to be itchy.,pos
I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!,pos
"Absolutely beautiful - 
usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.",pos
I found this while shopping at my local retailer and loved it. i was able to size down from my normal 10 to a 6. i got the warm white and it's lovely - couldn't wait to wear it. the detail is so pretty and love the buttons and 3/4 length sleeves - i am thrilled! i couldn't be happier!,pos
"This is a crop top but super boxy and wide. i expected it to be more fitted in the waist. since it sits out away a from the body a lot, it was not flattering. i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me. too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and i'm willing to pay full price for something that works.",neg
"I followed everyone's advice in the reviews and ordered up one size. i have a 32 inch waist, but size 10's (and 30's in pilcro hyphens) usually fit me. i ordered the 12 in this skirt, and it fits perfect. it's form fitting at waist and hips and then flares out, but i'm curvy. if you are straighter, it will be looser around the hips. i love the length. it hits me mid calf, so a bit lower than it does on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. the fabric is soft, but has no stretch. it's 100% cotton. there is a",pos

"I feel like this brand is very good at coming up with dresses that are flattering and i feel like they tend to fit my body well. i like the design of the dress a lot because it makes me feel like i am walking along with beach-it gets me in the mood for summer, and it is the perfect casual everyday dress for the summer. i love that the color scheme is understated which reinforces that this could be warn anywhere-even for everyday use. the strips are perfect for the look of this dress, and i don't",pos
"I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time. i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again! these liner socks actually stay on my feet... others brands i've tried before slip off my heel, but these stay hidden and stay put. plus a fun design!",pos
"Based on others' reviews, i knew i needed to try this beauty on to be sure of my size. as others mentioned, it runs 1-2 sizes large. but, unlike others, i don't feel i need a belt at the waist. i am 5'2"" 140# 34d and with my body style (super short and not super slim in the waist but also busty) this is the perfect boho fit and the perfect drape!!!  and the design and quality are superb to boot!!!",pos
Love this top. very easy to wear to lunch or site seeing. the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.,pos
I ordered xs/s. i usually wear medium in tops and coats. the next size up would've been too big so this cape does run large.,pos
"This is a very lovely looking sweater. unfortunately, it runs incredibly small. i'm only 5'3"" and the size small hit me above my mid-rise jeans. it doesn't fit at all how it's shown on the model. it's also a very delicate fabric. seems like it would snag easily. i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it, but i'm sending it back.",neg
"I was excited to get this shirt in the mail, i liked the pattern a lot, but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5'4"", 130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric, the shirt pulled open in the chest area, making it a complete fail. i'm sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric, especially since she's small on top. ther",neg
"I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall, it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!",neg
"I have featured photos below. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs and 34 d. i purchased a small petite. the fabric is cotton, i thought it would be rayon. it is lined with cotton fabric. the skirt has major poof. it falls like a midi on a petite. the waist runs high, which can not be a  good thing for a busty gal. why do i love it? the pattern is one of a kind. the colors are so fall. i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look. i can't resist this skirt. if your tall, this is a dream. if your petite, you can",pos
"I love the look of this top. my original order was returned because of a defect but the customer service was wonderful. they took it back at the store and sent out another one right away.
the style is very flattering and the quality of the denim is excellent.
love the back zipper as well.",pos
"I found this to fit really well and i've got a chest, and the hourglass to go with it. the stretch really helps it to be comfortable too. i reckon it's pretty versatile too.",pos
"I have this shirt in more than one color! i totally disagree with the first review i find this shirt to be super comfy and unique! i personally feel the material isn't scratchy at all! also, i love this designer they are one of my new favorites!",pos
"I just purchased these pajamas on-line and they are very pretty in person. i found them to be tts in my usual size small though a bit on the long side as i'm only 5'4"". i don't mind a little extra length though because these are just to lounge/sleep in. i think these soft pj's will be great during the warmer months as they are very light weight and comfortable. you'll absolutely love the print on them and wish there was a matching top!",pos
"This is an awesome t'shirt and i'm so glad it finally went on sale. i had been eying it for a while: it's true to size, can be dressed up with nice slacks or dressed down with boyfriend jeans. washes great and looks different from other shirts -- the ruffles on the bottom really make a difference. gotten lots of compliments.",pos
"This is the perfect dress! for it being a long maxi, it's surprisingly lightweight. the built in slip it covers everywhere you need it to without detracting from the overall look of the dress. i absolutely love it and wish it came in other colors/patterns.",pos
"Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.",pos
"This top fits nicely, lays nicely, and washed nicely! i purchased the same shirt in other colors because it was such a great purchase! i am short and it was not too long and not clingy.",pos
"This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag, with only a quick ironing. unfortunately, the first time i washed it (cold water, hang dry), it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy, is much shorter, and feels rougher to the touch. like another reviewer said (unfortunately, after i had purchased and washed!), i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only, because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno",neg
"Someone else mentioned that this fit like a grandpa sweater and they were absolutely right. it's definitely loose fitting, but it's really cute and well made. i usually get a medium size in tops/sweaters but, after reading the other reviews, i ordered the small and i'm so glad i did - it's the perfect casual cardigan. i wish it came in more colors!",pos
I love this shirt! it is so different from most things i get but such a fun change. the colors are bright and fun! you totally do not have to be western to enjoy this shirt and it's fun for a good country dancing/party/concert too. my roommate has already asked to borrow it (as in she's wearing it at a concert as i type this!). it is incredibly comfortable! i got the xs and was kind of surprised it still felt a little big. but i kept the size to wear it half tucked or even kind of oversized. i w,pos
"3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!",neg
"These pants are so great. i was debating between them and some sateen denim style pants from another store, but these definitely take the cake. the fit is awesome--although i am a 26 in the green and a 27 in the black, so that's kind of weird.",pos
"I'm so upset that this didn't work out. i'm petite at 5'2 and ordered this skirt in petite, however, i felt like it swallowed me up. the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire. i'm the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing, but on me, i feel like a schoolmarm. sadly, this is going back.",neg
"This is not my usual style, but the print is gorgeous and the dress is really high quality. i'm glad i purchased. it definitely runs big- i am usually an xs or s depending on brand but i ordered an xs p. it fits pretty well and falls at the perfect length just above my knees (i'm 5'3, 110). it's a little shapeless still but that's the look. i'm still sort of wondering if i should have gotten an xxs but the xs p definitely works especially for the length. can't wait to wear this. amazing sale pri",pos
"I've been moving toward a simple tee and jean wardrobe, and this is the perfect addition! it's so fun and different and so comfortable. i've been loving retailer's new tee's! it runs a little large but in a cute way.",pos
"Lovely dress. the beautiful colors are exactly as shown on the website. i'm 5'2"" and it reaches about midway down my shin. i'm normally a size 0 and i ordered the x-small and it fits perfectly. definitely a keeper!",pos
"I love this dress. it's beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn't see it in the picture, but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer, so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice.",pos
I tried this dress on in the store and loved it. i am not a aize 2 (usually a 6) but the dress's a-line shape allowed me to get a size 2. the dress is well made and the orange beaded work is lovely. a very pretty dress that i will wear a lot.,pos
"I recently purchased this tunic and love it! its not to big, hangs just right, arm holes are not to big and the material is very comfortable! looks great with white jeans, shorts, or just jeans. i will get a lot of wear all year round! fits true to size. oh, slimming too!",pos
"This swimsuit is beautiful. the quality is excellent. controls without being too thick. the colors are bright and the pattern is gorgeous. i am curvy , 34dd and the top fit perfect. good bottom coverage. very happy with this purchase.",pos
"The skirt on this trench has tons of fabric. it goes on and on, and drapes and twirls beautifully. as a trench, it fits well and does the trick. i believe the skirt is heavy enough not to blow around too much, but i haven't been out in extremely strong winds yet. it fits true to size, at the knee (i'm 5'5""). i sized up because i assumed i would be layering it over clothes. my regular size fit fine over a lightweight cardigan.",pos
"I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.",neg
"Beautiful cardigan, but it does run large.  i'm about 5'9"", 160 lbs, normally a large in tops, and the medium fits great. it's still a bit roomy, but i think this cardigan is meant to be a tad roomy.  i agree with another reviewer that it's a bit itchy on bare skin, but it's wool, so that's a given.  overall, a great cardigan for fall!",pos
"For once i found a peasant top that wasn't a balloon. i'm 5'1 and curvier on top and the small fit great. the blouse billowed a bit but it didn't make me look like a hot air balloon. the pattern of the blouse, a mix of various floral swatches, is very pretty. the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall. i can't wait to wear it!",pos
"This dress is gorgeous. i took the advice of a previous reviewer and tried one size down, it fit perfectly. i am usually between a 10 or 8 in retailer dresses depending on the cut, the size 8 in this was great. i am near the small chested side a 36b and there was still plenty of room in the top. the swimmers on the dress are embroidered and i didn't really notice until i saw the inside. beautiful detail. the dress is a lightweight cotton and great for warm weather. its even more flattering to be a",pos
I am in love with this skirt! it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while. the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give. it hugs your curves but doesn't cut in anywhere! i was able to easily go down a size from my usual. i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well!,pos
"I had been searching for an almost 50s style dress and i saw this one and instantly loved it. i wind up sending back so many things i get through retailer but this dress was everything i hoped it would be. i got the green one with the white dots. very comfortable, it just out a little with the hips because of the cut which is very 50s styling--it makes the waist look more narrow...",pos
Love this. bought the cream in store and the burgundy online. perfect alone or to wear under an retailer sweater.,pos
"This is one of my favorite purchases ever-from anywhere! one of my new years resolutions was to stop wearing work out clothes all of the time. this is as comfortable as any work out jacket and looks classy. can be dressed up or down. its warm, flattering and unique.",pos
"I am in love with this dress. the colors are amazing but also is the fabric. it is soft and supple. i am a curvy girl and this dress does all justice to my bust, waist, and hips. this is truly an amazing dress. you can dress it up or dress it down and the best part it is professional enough for a causal office look.",pos
Love the versatility of this dress. looks better in person!,pos
"I purchased the blue with white dots. the shape was awful, but looked like a sack - returned",neg
Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky. these fit the bill! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these. look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture. the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived. i sized down a size and the fit is perfect. highly recommend!,pos
"Ordered this top online, as i loved the colors and design, but i should have listened to the other reviewers. i ordered my usual size m, and it was just very unflattering. it was short and wide, not at all like it's pictured on the model. needless to say it was immediately shipped back.",neg

i seriously love them!! i have worn them so often
i may have to ban myself from them for a week.

i got an xs because the small looked too baggy. 
the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect.",pos
"I bought a medium, my usual size, and had to exchange for a small. i love flowy sweaters, but this one truly fits one size big. the arms and body of the sweater fit larger. beautiful sweater with jeans or legging- can't wait to wear!",pos
Not sure where to start with this top...it's that good! i am usually a large in most maeve tops and that's sizing up for extra flow. i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders. i wanted more flow (as always) so i went up in size. for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size. this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have! it has sold out with,pos
"I love this top!! in fact if it came in more colors, i'd buy a few more. it's just so soft and comfortable, wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights. the neckline is perfect, love the subtle details. it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath. yes, i love it, just wish there were more colors.",pos
Love the versatility of the dress. very easy to dress either up or down. i've been able to wear it out for a casual day with a denim jacket and booties (just like the stock photo!) or even wear it to work with a black jacket and flats. the color is beautiful and the material is very soft and comfortable. absolutely love the cut and design of the dress on top. only thing i would mention is that the dress is a bit form fitting than expected. it definitely hugs your curves.,pos
I got the brown one and i'm very please with the softness of the thread and the light weight feel of the fabric.,pos
"As others stated, it was a tad bizarre to have a mock neck on the spring dress, however, i would wear this in the fall with boots and a nice moto jacket. another ""but"" is i wasn't sure about the color. i am very pale and the pale color is pretty much my skin color... however, the blue flowers and black lace make up for it as far as colors, and everyone liked it on me. lastly, cut: wow, this was just really nice on, very flattering,. i usually try on regular size in store and order petite, but th",pos

Very pretty but too short for my age. looks well made and green dress is beautiful. it was just too short for me to be comfortable wearing.,pos

"When i saw this dress the model was standing in an outdoor setting and i fell in love with it but then i noticed the model in an indoors photo the dress looked different. as i studied the difference, it was the way the plaid fell on each dress. the one i liked fell more vertically giving it a slimming effect and the others were horizontal giving it a widening effect so, i went to my local retailer to see. they had the one i liked on a dummy. it is tts and the plaid matched perfectly. the front flo",pos

I really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me.   made my curvy body look shapeless.  also had a button crack before i even put it on.  returned it.,neg
"I purchased the green print which has so many patterns and colors which makes this dress have a very interesting look. i love that it has a drop waist because it is so flattering to most body types.the other thing i liked was that this dress came in petite sizes, perfect for me.",pos
"Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made, not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty, this is not the dress for you.",neg
I love this top. it's not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams. it's super soft and comes in some great colors. i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee!,pos
"Love this top. the material is so comfy yet it looks dressy. great for a night out with black pants or a skirt. i'm 5ft8inches, 38-27-38 and a small fit perfectly which seems true to retailer sizing. flattering yet hides a little post holiday belly. i wore a nude rackerback bra with the top, and that works perfectly with the design.",pos
"This is a great shirt that goes with everything. it's super sexy and i have to say....the girls look great in it! i bought the black first and went back for the green. the quality of the shirt is great...not cheap and no smell, at least not in my experience,  like was mentioned by another reviewer. i can't say enough about how cute this shirt is!",pos

"It is my favorite piece in my closet right now. it is cute. it feels like a pillow. i just want to sleep in it, but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off.",pos
"This has been my go to top every time i go out lately. i just make sure i am with different people. the length is perfect and not too long. i wear a strapless black bra and you cannot see through the shirt. the only thing i don't like about it, is the three buttons in the back at the top are very, very difficult to button.",pos
"I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length, too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.

rolls are not sewn on both ends, so you'll have to re-roll each wash.

wish you carried these basics at all times.",pos
Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26's on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!,pos
I'm so sick of all workout tops being baggy. they look sloppy on my frame. this top is ultra soft and fits great! the black/white one looks more heathered grey in person. i ordered an xs as all tops lately are just huge on me. i should be a small and i will be returning for that proper size.,pos

I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.,pos
This is my favorite top! i'm a 36d and usually wear a medium or large. i love this paired with skinny jeans or my level 99 blue shorts.,pos
Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.,pos
This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.,pos

I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.,neg
"I really wanted the dark grey, but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person, the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size, and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.",pos
This is a super cute top. the online image does not do it justice. the scalloped edges around the arms give it a flirty and feminine look. i got lots of compliments when i paired it with the shorebird pencil skirt. the material is thick enough to not make it see-through and it's pretty tts.,pos
"Like other reviewers have said, this is very sheer, look at the sleeve in the picture and you'll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well. the material posed challenges for it's creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other, tight enough that it would have ripped if i weren't careful. tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit. bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life. loose, billowy, and perhaps",neg

I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!,pos

"This dress is very, very flattering which i was a little surprised about because i have a smaller chest! it is pretty long, coming to right around my knees and i love the buttons! i would say that the quality is not 100% there, it is very thin material but i am still very happy with it. i really wish they made this dress in other colors because i would buy them in a heartbeat! it is a perfect summer dress and i can't wait to wear it!!",pos
Love the shirt and style. shirt looks better in person than online picture. i would get a size down because it runs a little big.,pos
"I am in love with this dress. it's super soft, flattering  and comfy i want to wear it everyday. it was recommended to me by a friend who is taller and slimmer than i am so i was skeptical of the fit. sometimes you see things that are only meant for models to wear. so not true here. i am 5'3"" 140 pounds with slightly broad shoulders and i bought an xs. i'm considering getting a second one.",pos
"I just received this shirt in the mail, and i'm in love. it isn't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class. i can't wait to wear it! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasn't as dramatic as the picture; i'm not seeing it. i think the blue stands out very well. i know i should say, ""hurry and get yours before they're gone,"" but in truth, i'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt! :)",pos
"The look is frest, crisp with a touch of romance. very retailer!",pos
"I absolutely love this top, especially for fl weather.
it's soft and falls just a tad longer in the back and is a little fitted in the bust area with a very feline look.
i had the tank as well and just love the satin trim!
i will say it runs a little smaller than the tank bc i have xs in the tank and needed a small in this!
love it!",pos
"Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium. it was still tight around the girls (and i'm not that well endowed), but too big in the armholes. the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material. i kept it (because i'm lazy) but not sure how much i'll wear it given the strange fit.",neg
"This blouse is beautiful and true to size. i was so happy it fit after ordering it online. i'm a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly. length was perfect on me...not too long and not short. i'm 5'1"" for reference. definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats. love it!",pos
"I couldn't be happier with this skirt! i was expecting a jersey-type material, but was pleasantly surprised by the thicker, textured, higher quality material. the ruffle on the front is such a cute feature. this skirt moves and flows very nicely when walking. it is lined and has an elastic waistband, it's super comfortable. so far i've paired it with a bright red knotted tee and a sheer white sleeveless button-down. i receive compliments every time i wear it! i'm 5'2"", 110 lbs, i ordered an xs a",pos
As usual this dress does not disappoint. looks great with boots and is the perfect day to date dress.,pos
Great staple item. i have it in multiple colors and like them all. easy to add statement necklace to change up the look. wear it under cardi or jacket to make it not look 'tent' like.,pos
"I am in love with this top! i saw it online, and i was a bit nervous to order it because it's a little pricy for a tank top, and i was worried it was going to be too short on me. i was so wrong! the detail on the top is so beautiful, and looks even better in person! it hit me right at mid hip, and looks so cute with jeans and sandals. i sometimes get frustrated with the cut of the arms with retailer clothes because they are cut so low that you see your bra when you lift your arms, but this top is",pos
"Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves. i'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium. the fabric was amazing. the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste. 
i'm 5'7"" and 140. this landed mid calf. not my preference. 

retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it.",neg
"I love these jeans! when i saw them in my retailer store, i instantly fell in love. they fit like a dream and they look so much better in person than online. they're definitely a boyfriend fit, so if you're between sizes, go down a size. i've already gotten tons of compliments!",pos
"Love this top! super comfortable, great fit, and really pretty colors. probably going to buy it in multiple colors it fits so great.",pos
"These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6, weigh around 115, have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long, with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them, but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand, because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants.",pos
"This is a high-quality swimsuit that can be worn inside out. easy to wear colors, fantastic pattern placement. the other side is an intense blue. i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site. 
.
 i think this should look great on athletic figures. the back is low-cut and the bottom has medium coverage, not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms. not ideal for hour-glass figures as there is no bust support, and you will show quite a bit from the side (it is cut in at the front w",pos
"A 3-season top that compliments jeans, dress pants, shorts & skirts. light-weight and double layered (so should you go without a bra the girls have protection). emphasizes nice shoulders, length just covers any belly flaws. i'm a 6-8 and could have gone small or medium here.",pos
"I ordered these because of the side zipper, but they zip in front, even though the order listing and bag label called them ""wine, side zip pants."" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back, even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong.",neg
I bought this in blue and love it. i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses. i ended up with an extra small petite in this. it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough. i highly recommend the dress if you size way down.,pos
This top is soft and comfortable without being some shapeless drag with too much fabric. i did size down as did the other woman in the store with me. i can see many more wears out of this top. wish it had been made in other colors or white would be beautiful!,pos
One of my favorites for comfy cute this summer! the color is a beautiful berry color! also love the length... it feels a little longer than a typical top which i love! 5'9,pos
"Gorgeous material, great length for tall girls, warm without being too heavy, super soft. i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extra-small. i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year, not sure if its vanity sizing. this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple - elegant and sophisticated. the grey is that nice soft grey that doesn't wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions. great",pos
"Cute casual skirt, i love that it is longer in the back than the front so i can comfortably wear it to work.  i had to size up, which i usually do in bottoms that do not have stretch because i'm my athletic frame.",pos
It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts. really unflattering. avoid buying this skirt,neg
"Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed, all the way around, perhaps purposely, but ratty looking, all the same.",neg
"I haven't owned a denim jacket since college, but i felt inspired this season. this pilcro jacket is perfect. a little distressed along the edges, tailored fit, and i love the cozy collar. looks expensive. fits really well.",pos
"Haven't worn it yet, but i am loving this top. it is much prettier in person. i sized up to a med based on reviews and it looks like it runs small. i didn't try it on until i got home and probably could have done ok in a small but will keep the medium so it's not tight across my chest. the knit material that makes up the arms and back is thin, which is my only complaint. if it was slightly thicker it would look nicer and i'm sure wear longer. i'm happy with my purchase-the colors, fabric, embroi",pos
Very attractive and well fitting. absolutely recommend it.,pos
The color of this top is amazing--much more vibrant than in the photo and the fit is perfect. it is very flirty and pretty and the detailing around the top is gorgeous. it's pricey but i splurged and am glad i did. it looks adorable with a corduroy skirt and boots for the fall.,pos
"Great fit i'm petite and bought size 29. my hips and waist differ by 10"", so i'm very curvy. i love the fit and look just by rolling them up. my 1st pair of ag jeans and i will definitely buy more.",pos
"These pants look beautiful when you first see them. it goes downhill from there. the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants. it felt fine when pulled up, but it is a struggle. i could get past that, but when i looked in the mirror, i could see right through them. no lining and not very thick material for this price!!! a real bummer, especially since it was a birthday gift.",neg
"Great jean! i will live in these this winter. so flattering, bum looks good, leg is slender and lengthening. perfect petite jean with a flared leg.",pos
"This dress is gorgeous- it's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is! i found it to fit tts. although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam, it fits perfectly. if you have a bigger chest (d+), i would foresee this dress being too snug. however, i am a c and it fits just right! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops, but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo",pos
"This is a beautiful skirt, but runs very small. i usually wear a size 8 and could not get the side zipper closed....at all.",neg
"I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2"", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!",neg
"I purchased this shirt in black. luckily, it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.",pos
"Purchased this maxi dress in blue print, size petite xxsmall. even in that size i have some difficulty finding dresses that fit. but this one does perfectly. no complaints at all. length is a bit longer than pictured on model, but that's fine for a maxi summer easy style dress. i am quite short besides being petite so this fits the bill. am sure it will be worn quite often for many different occasions.",pos
"I absolutely love these pants! i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper. i've always liked the look of these pants but didn't think i had the body type to pull them off being 5'5"" with some curves. i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small. i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips. the draping isn't as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didn't add weight to my frame. the mate",pos
"This skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather. the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long. the length is perfect for a more conservative look, i don't wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg. it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size.",pos
These pants are so great! they fit as expected and are a nice skinny crop but nothing too tight. the fabric is very soft making these pants incredibly comfortable. this was my first pair of the stet crops but will probably buy another pair in the future.,pos
"I got this tunic in the bright red, and it is a great, fun color that leans just slightly to the orange side of red. (my computer screen makes it look more orange than it does in person. i'm happier with the actual color.) the fabric is soft, comfortable and hangs beautifully. wrinkles fall out when you hang it up. i also have the tegan tunic in 2 colors and find the fit to be the same. however, the hi-low hem on this dress is a little more exaggerated than on the tegan. the tegan travels very w",pos
The horizontal lines on the skirt and top gives the wearer and very nice dress. i am short so i got the 6 petite and it fits perfectly. the fabric is thick and stretchy.,pos
"I love this dress. it's cool and comfortable in this crazy heat! the fabric has a great feel to it. i do wish it was just a little longer.. 

(i'm 5'8"", 145#, and bought a medium)",pos
"I bought these in white (not a harsh white, more soft-looking), and am very pleased with them. they are true to the manufacturer's sizing (i own another pair of pants from elevenses in the same size), which runs somewhat large (i'm 5' 5"" tall, weigh 135 pounds, and the size 6 fit perfectly). the back of the waistband is elasticized, so there's some give. they're long enough on me that they hit the floor; with heels, they're perfect. they look as pictured, but what you can't tell from the photo i",pos
I wanted to love this dress. it really has no style. i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung. i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight. had to return it.,neg
"This didn't work for me.  the piece looked cheap, rode very high...needed to be longer.  the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes.  it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece.  this went back.",neg
Beautiful flowing feminine dress. runs large; size down. hot pink color. well made.,pos
I absolutely love this top! cute and feminine without being over the top. i basically love everything meadow rue puts out there...and this was no exception.,pos
"It was bit on pricey side but it was love at first sight! i couldn't let go after i tried it on..it is soft, lightweight, moves with me, keeps me warm (not just from top up)..it feels silky to the touch and is very versatile and stylish..

runs true to size and it expands a bit the more you wear it ...",pos
"Great sweater, beautiful detail, warm and cozy. i will wear this well into spring because it's a nice weight for cool spring evenings. the knit pattern is beautiful and will be great for casual wear and dressy occasions as well.",pos
"While i love the design and shape of this blouse, the fabric was of very poor quality. i will return it.",neg
"One of my new absolute favs! so elegant and flattering. the dress is as appears online and it is true to size. i purchased my usual size 4 with 27"" waist, chest 34 b/c. note, that there is not a lot of give to the fabric, so busty women may need to size up. purchased with the minuet necklace!",pos
"I really liked this dress in pictures online. i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays. everything about this dress was a disappointment, especially at this price point. the fit was weird: tight in some places, too loose in others (i'm usually xs or s, i ordered this one is s). it's made out of a fairly thick and warm material, yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures, especially in the back, making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck, upper b",neg
"Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.",neg
"I am short so this ends up being really long on me, but i like that i can show off some amazing heels with this skirt. lately, i have been getting into grey so that it puts more attention on my accessories. the cut of this skirt is amazing, and the thick waistband is non-traditional which makes something that normally would be boring, really stand out (plus it helps hide baby fat!). the fabric is a medium weight, but it does flow nicely, and it does not seem to wrinkle easily which is a huge plu",pos
"This dress is beautiful - the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning. i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it. i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up (i also like loose fitting clothing) and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok, will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler.",pos
"I agree with the last reviewer this is a great cozy sweater. i took an xs regular and i am 5'6"" 108lbs. the pin is used to close the sweater (no button). plenty of hand-knit sweater vests,wraps,shawls come with or are given with pins for closure. you will find many uses for the pin but as it is shown in the photo..... not likely.",pos
"I picked up this tee in store, where they had a pattern that isn't pictured here (purple floral on a grey background). this is a loose fitting tee, and usually the loose fitting tees i try on at retailer are really unflattering- however, this one fits great and is flattering. the fabric is wrinkle resistant and comfortable. this top will definitely be a staple of my spring and summer wardrobe! considering ordering in other colors.

for reference, i'm 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 measurements, 34ddd",pos
"I got this in black, size medium, my usual size. i am fairly ""curvy"" on top and found the shape in that area very flattering to my figure. it is shown as being rather drapey in front and indeed it does fit rather large at the bottom & indeed through the body itself. since i'm slim there, i will have to tailor it, am used to this considering i have to buy to fit my chest. but i'm keeping it for sure as i love the fabric and i think it will become a staple of my wardrobe. good job retailer!",pos
"I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.",pos
I was pleasantly surprised with this cardigan! i get so many compliments- i can easily see me carrying this into my fall wardrobe!,pos
"This dress is the best of all worlds: sophisticated, modern, and flattering. i was surprised that the ""dress"" is actually two separate pieces: a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay, which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season. i had two babies back-to-back and am not back to my pre-baby shape, but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was. i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks, and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it.",pos
Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.,pos
"I purchased this sweater at my local retailer store a few weeks ago. i picked the dark grey color which is more of a neutral beige or oatmeal color. i love it! i just wish i had purchased it earlier to wear through the fall. it has a substantial weight and is warm. this sweater/poncho has a great drape that is really flattering, especially in the back. it does have slits on the sides so you really would need to wear a layer underneath. i've worn it with a turtleneck and button-ups and it looks rea",pos
"Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30"" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !",neg
"Bought this in navy in the spring and this fall in green. i am 5'10"" and 57 with very long legs and they are too short to be work appropriate as a dress, at least for me. i wear both with leggings, short boots and a variety of jackets and love them. they feel like butter against the skin and are incredible comfortable. recommend. for reference i'm about 157# and an athletic/straight build and bought m in the blue and l in the green. go figure.",pos
I purchased this in the black in an xl. i am typically a 14-16 dress size and i would say this runs tts with a flowing fit on the bottom. the top is fitted but has some stretch to it. absolutely gorgeous fit and quality. i love this so much i want to purchase the teal color. a spring must have!!!,pos
"I loved this dress as soon as i saw it online. but the price was high, and i was nervous about taking a chance on a knit dress. would it be too clingy, too stretchy, too scratchy, too...wrong? i took a chance on it after reading other reviews, and as soon as i tried it on, i knew i had found the perfect dress for winter. it is super comfortable, and the quality of the knit is very good. the material is soft and warn. the dress looks fabulous with bright tights and high boots. in the two weeks i",pos
"Sadly, going back. ordered m, light color option, very difficult to pull over my head, not a good sign. got it on and neckline looked attractive (height w/o being a mock turtle), but whole thing a bit small around middle. could order the l, but i'm not liking the feeling of the fabric, it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch: 33 cotton/27 poly/27 acrylic and 95 rayon/5 spandex ""contrast"", which must mean the stripes. combine w/fact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle",neg
"The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit, and drapes beautifully.

the top runs tts, but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.

this works for casual or dress. for dress, i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw, i bought this in black, which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black, it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed.",pos
Great fit and very flattering if you have curves. perfect to throw over just about anything. i've only owned it for 9 days and have worn it four times.,pos
"1. i'm 5'6"" tall with a short waist and long legs, and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles. i would have kept it if it had stopped mid-calf like in the photo.

2. i'm 38-32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly in the waist hip area, so i would say it runs true to size.

3. the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy, so that's a plus. at least you don't have to undo them to go to the bathroom.",neg
"I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.",neg
"I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.",neg
"I've been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out! i love it. i was afraid i couldn't pull it off because i'm 5'3 and very petite, but i don't think it matters. it feels so light and airy and i can't wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts. great piece.",pos
"I was so excited for this dress.. but sadly it did not meet expectations. the gauze fabric already had several snags/pullers in it. the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriere.(i'm 5'7"") i normally take a 10/12 and ordered this in a l.. it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top. also, i like to have the first button open, but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey. it's definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding",neg

"This skirt is very comfortable and moves well. i'm 5'4"" and ordered a 2p, which fits perfectly. the length hits just above the top of my feet. the patterned chiffon is sheer and the skirt has a short black slip underneath that ends just above my knees. i have a small waist and wider hips, but found the inner slip to fit loosely enough so that it doesn't ride up when i walk or sit. the two slits on either side were a great length and make this skirt both flirty and quirky. you'll get tons of comp",pos
"These are long, easily wear with skinny jeans, they do not cling and are not see through! the colors are great!",pos
Wow! love this skirt! and i totally agree with reviewers--this item runs a full size small. i am normally a true six on bottom and it was a bit too tight considering i would wash/dry/shrink. the size eight is perfect. fabric is very good twill and forgiving... $19.95 and 40% off!!! cannot wait to wear my bargain skirt next summer!!!,pos
I feel like i'm cheating when i put this on it's so comfy almost like wearing cozy pj's but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like i'm lounging at the same time. i wish this came in more colors!!,pos
"I purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time! it is such a lovely soft tee, with a delicate flower design. i wear it with jeans. it always makes me feel happy.",pos

Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!,pos

"The heart version is very pretty, i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs, as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me, like 3/4 length, not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.

for reference, i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, and short.",pos
"Absolutely stunning. the color, the pattern, the quality. i love everything about this top.",pos
"Everything about the dress is worth it. it's true the buttons are loosely sewn on, but that's easily fixed. i'm a slim person but broad in the shoulders, so i had to exchange the small for a medium because it has a narrow, fitted construction. large-chested ladies or athletic types should size up.",pos

"Whatever happened to sizing! pretty print and color but has enough fabric for 2 tops. it is also unlined which is not a huge issue. i wore it with a cami. the arms weren't too gaping for me, thankfully. i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides. i am 140 lbs and got the small. should have gone 1 or even 2 sizes smaller.",neg
"I love, love, love this brand. these people know how to cut and construct a dress. i'm apple-shaped and have trouble finding fitted dresses that flatter me, but this one makes me look curvy and hides my flaws. the pattern lays perfectly and will make you look great. the fabric is high-quality and fully-lined. it's perfect for work or for going out. i love that it's black and bronze-y, because i can wear it with black or brown accessories. i'm generally between a l/xl in retailer and the l fits wel",pos
"This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine, dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous, very comfortable on the skin, very flowy so it doesn't have a ""heavy"" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years.",pos

"This is a unique blouse, it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago. it is a gorgeous item. it does have a boxy fit, but it is not unflattering. i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product. 
the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice.",pos
"The gorgeous coral color of this skirt makes it a great all seasons skirt. the slightly heavier weight of skirt makes it extremely adorable for fall/winter. pair it with some tights, chunky knit and booties, good to go. very flattering one. has a slight a-line cut to it. i love love this one.",pos
"This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities.",pos
I absolutely love this dress. i have received so many compliments. the quality is incredible.,pos

I debated between the xs and the small..and ended up with the small because it's 100% cotton i probably couldn't probably gotten the xs one. we will see if it shrinks. i hope it does a little. i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine.,pos

Great with leggings and skinny jeans! it's comfortable too!,pos
"This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry.",neg
This is such a cute top. i like it both off and on the shoulder. easily tucked or left out depending how you want to style it.,pos
"I love this shirt! i was surprised by the other reviews. it's boxy, but not unflattering. i get so many compliments on this. a steal for the price.",pos
"This is a great sweater. great color and style. i love that it's a little retro. can be worn with jeans and tights. highly recommend. it does run a little big, but not by a lot.",pos
"Absolutely love this top. it is beautiful, well made and so unique.",pos
I agree with the other reviewers. this shirt is cuter in person. it is a flattering cut and the design is even prettier than in the photos. the color is more navy--not the charcoal color it looks in the photos. the stitching is also more colorful in real life.,pos
"I decided to splurge. i would not normally spend $200 for a pair of jeans, but when they went on sale, i decided to go for it. i am so glad that i did. mother has a customer for life. these jeans are the best by far. i normally wear a size 4 (27) in most jeans, but wear a 28 in j brand and some others. so i was a little nervous by previous reviewers not just on this website. i decided to go with the 28 since in mother brand this is actually a 4/6. they fit great!",pos
"I ordered this online, and took it back the day i got it. i could not fit the neck hole over my head, therefore i couldn't even see how it truly fit. i had high hopes for this dress.",neg
I love these shirts. ordered in 2 colors and they are great with leggings and skinny jeans and scarves. so comfortable and on me a little long but not too long!! the fabric is fabulous and a great weight. one of my favorites for sure.,pos
"The model in this photo should be standing tall, because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper! i ordered a small, and am 130pounds 5'5""- the dress fits like a glove, and is a pull over style. the nude slip- lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel, yet nice breezy, sexy appeal. this dress can be worn to work, on a hot date, and even a nice weekend look. when i say slimming i mean it. the center detail- grabs the most perf",pos
Love my new top! i wear it casually with skinny navy pants and dressed up with new wide leg winter white pants! it's funky style garnered lots of compliments. as a mother of two teens i love to dress cute and appropriate. it really pairs well with so much and the bold flower makes it stand out!,pos
"Cute and super comfortable...so it's the best of both worlds. it fits true to size, but i bought a size up to add a little extra length. love the soft blue color and ruffles.",pos
These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!,pos
"I saw this online and immediately purchased the top in gray. it's so easy and casual but the shoulder detailing give it something different and unique for a regular gray shirt. the fit is loose and comfortable but not overly big, just right. i can't wait to pair it with my new white jeans for summer!",pos
"I bought the grey, which is a gorgeous color. i like the long length in the arms (though i tried it on in different colors and the arm length did very). soft and pretty. i like the length. the back does wrinkle, but i still like the shirt. it's loose, casual and flattering.",pos
Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!,neg
"Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.",neg
"I decided to go shopping at my local co store and as soon as i walked in, i saw this skirt but it was used  as a top with green cropped summery pants on a mannequin. one of the lovely salesgirls decided she liked it better that way after she tried it as a top herself.  i tried it as well and love it as a top! she was small framed and my height and told me she sized up for comfort and she was correct. if used with a strapless bra, your regular size ( mine is a small) will be uncomfortable. howeve",pos
"I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box, but when i started to unbutton it to try it on, two buttons split in half! it's going right back.",neg
This is tee is so soft and the other one in the same brand is the same. love the details also and the color wash.,pos
"This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!",pos
"I found this skirt in a size 8 at my local retailer store. i admired it on the website but to see and feel it in person was very appealing. i tried it on and it fit beautifully, a style that looks great on my figure. i love the mohair weave of the color block sections. the negative is this skirt is really pricy but i had my birthday discount and since the size 8 was sold out online and this skirt must have been a return the chances of it going on sale in a size 8 were very slim. i am still admirin",pos
"I ordered two colors and was happy with them both.  i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer.  i like a layered look, and having layers to peel as needed.  these tops are great on their own as well!  i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length.  really love the fabric too!",pos
"I'm so thrilled with these! the fabric is a little heavier, and they just fit really well when similar styles tend to be baggy.",pos
"I found this cardigan/sweater in the sale room at retailer in navy. thought i would just try it on. the picture does not do this justice. it is a basic piece but it is so soft and comfortable and when on, it has a little bit of a whimsical swing to it. i loved the way it kind of came to life. i wear a m/l and bought the m. i have a 36d bust and it looked great. it is a nice weight for spring/fall. it is not a heavy sweater.",pos
Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.,pos
"I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight. i have never had this problem before. i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5' 4"" tall and 117 lbs. the length is perfect and i really like the style. if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser. sorry that this did not work for me.",neg
"I saw this on the rack, and tried it on because it was just so beautiful. the beading and embroidery details are unlike any piece of clothing i've seen in a ready-to-wear store. it feels and wears much more like a couture piece.
i wasn't planning on making such a big purchase, but it's just so beautiful i had to have it. i doubt i'll find another item of such quality and craftsmanship for the price.
runs large- i'm normally a size 6 (135lbs) and the size 4 fit perfectly.",pos
I love these jeans-the minute you put them on they feel broken in and comfortable. they do have a long inseam and need to be worn with a stacked heel but that adds to the aesthetic. i ordered my normal size-i usually wear a 27 and could have kept them-but wanted a snugger fit through the bum. so i gave them to a friend and ordered one size down and got the perfect fit for me.,pos
"This top is a keeper. subtle plaid, flowy fit. so cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would definitely recommend!",pos
"I tried this one with the free ship/20% without much expectation so i was surprised by this nice piece. i am not usually a fan of sheer shirts, but this one manages to be sheer yet not see through! the black color works that magic. the linen makes this a nicer material rather than the usual knit. i am not usually a linen fan as it gives me the itches, but this is soft and light. the back is really beautiful and brighter colors in person. the balance between the front and back lengths does work a",pos
Love this top. work appropriate and dress down worthy. i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist. comfortable fabric.,pos
I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!,pos
"I bought this unique beauty in a size 0. the fit was superb and without compromise. the ascetics are incomparable, as well as the quality. the most stunning dress i have purchased from retailer in quite a while!",pos
"Very cute, great fit and super comfortable. perfect for fall with tall boots",pos
"I had high hopes for this top based on the photos, but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it, almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all.",neg
"These looked so fun, i had to have them! i usually wear a 14 in pants, but the large fit well. despite a lack of thigh gap and walking in these all night, i didn't lose a single sequin. they're comfortable and get a ton of compliments. if you're considering them, i definitely recommend going for it!",pos
"This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered, my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.",pos
These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.,pos
"Absolutely perfect and worth every penny! i am 5'8"" and normally between a 4 and 6 in jackets. while the small fit, i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms. insanely comfortable and truly stunning on. expect compliments when you are wearing it!",pos
"I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and i'm so happy i did. i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season. i wore this with a black 3/4 sleeve top, dark skinny jeans and black booties....perfect look for most seasons in dallas. so happy about this purchase!",pos
"This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size, and not too loose, but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!",pos
Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.,pos
"I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.",neg
"I was intrigued by this vest on-line but really wanted to try it on first before i purchased it. stopped into my local retailer store today and was happy to see they had it in stock. i am typically a 10/12 and purchased this in the m/l. this picture does not give the vest justice in terms of the way it falls, which to me is what makes a vest a success or not. also, the colors are great. i was wearing a cream sweater and black pants when i tried it on, went great with those colors but i think it wi",pos
"Made of casual materials, perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top. has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top.",pos
"I usually wear a medium, and this jacket was no exception. the jacket is a shorter style as pictured. it is still flattering, even though it is a little boxy. i got the grey, which is a dark gray/slight greige color. if you like edgier over boho, this is a cute transitional jacket.",pos
"The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line. the top is navy and the lower arms are grey. the sweater overall has more punch than pictured. this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece. it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans. it is a long sweater, but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up. i also really like that the front is not too flowy. i am looking forward to wearing this all fall.",pos
"The patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person. it is lined and feels very well made. the pockets don't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do, which is great. the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves. if you can, try this one on in a store before buying. for reference: i am 5'7"", have broad shoulders, am pear shaped (i have hips and a good sized rear end), 34b bust, weigh 145 lbs., and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms. the size 8 fit",pos
It sits a little short but works great for a jacket when you don't want to have a big winter coat when going out.,pos
"This chemise is very pretty in person. when i tried it on, i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise. the material is kind of thin, but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it, it won't show. it looked super cute with a denim jacket on. i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly (for reference, i am 5'2"", 34b, 120lbs). i am very happy with this purchase, and i can't wear it as a chemise, a coverup, or a hot day sundress. highly recommended!",pos
I just bought these jeans and i absolutely love them. they are my new favorites. i like them so much i am buying another pair. i am short but always wear heels and these are perfect in every way. slimming as well.,pos
"I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin, and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.",pos
"I ordered this dress in a xs petite. i am 5'0"" 105 lbs. the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy. the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress, the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger. i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back. it might work on taller people, like the model, but i would steer clear if you are a petite.",neg
"This tunic is a great length - i'm 5'4"" and it hits me mid/lower thigh. it's so soft and flowy which i love. i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that i'm almost 5 months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby. arm holes are big but a cami can fix that. i got both colors available: the ivory and light red.",pos
"I love this skirt! the color is beautiful, much darker than in the photo. the only issue i have is with the length. it's much longer in real life. i'm definitely going to need to have it shortened.",pos
This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette. i typically wear a 0p and ordered an xxs--it fits perfectly. it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath.,pos
"I noticed a xxs p at the store. i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs, but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly. i love it! very stylish and flattering.",pos
This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!,pos
"Adorable top! sweet but not too sweet, can go either casual or dressy depending on what it is paired with. i was looking for cropped tops as that silhouette works better for my proportions with the plethora of cropped bottoms that are in stores. as another reviewer mentioned, it is lined so no cami is necessary. the label says dry clean only however, i have washed it in a mesh bag on gentle in cold water and hung to dry without any issues. the dry cleaning warning may be because of the lace on t",pos
"This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.",pos
"I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now. its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design. i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasn't for me. its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didn't have a small left in the sizes, i ordered a medium and it still ran small, i was very surprised. its was also disappointing",neg
This blouse is wonderful. i just got and wore the wine colored blouse today. i received so many compliments. i love it and with the sale price it is so worth it.,pos
"I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events.  this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality.  however, the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding.  the size 4 seemed to fit perfectly, but the fabric had no give.  it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size 34aa.  for the price, i expected better.  the color and style of the dress is gorgeous, so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer. . .",neg
"Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!",pos
"Very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers. i ordered in my normal size medium. neckline is cut a little low, but not enough to change my mind on the purchase.",pos
"I took a chance and ordered this top on sale, even after reading the troublesome reviews. this updated take on the turtleneck is a keeper for me. the purple color is vibrant and the collar lays without repeated fussing. i ordered the xs (116, 5'4"" for reference) and the fit was tts and close to, but not snug on my torso. there is room for a button down blouse underneath (as styled in a gallery pic) and i did not find the sleeves to be problematic, as it fit me close enough to the body to not giv",pos
This top flows so nice. i get so many compliments when i wear it. plus the color is an interesting blue,pos
"I'm currently on the prowl for the other colors of this fantastic sweater dress/tunic. i own the lavender in size m and it fits perfectly on me (5'3"" 36dd) without enhancing what i want to hide. great for winter",pos
I am so in love with this top. can be worn on or off the shoulders. the color is amazing!,pos
"I tried both the xs/s and the m/l and found the larger size to be more roomy in the shoulders, and just swish a bit better around the hips. this is a change from many long vests my closet, which tend to be size small or medium, as are my blouses and tops. however, could happily live with either size and color, gorgeous.",pos

"Well made embroidery, held up well in the wash. love the unique green color pattern! comfortable.  got a size 4(115#, 5'2"", 34b).",pos
"These cords are beautiful in the wine color and fit very well! i am 5'1 and got the petite size and felt they were a little to short, i know they are cropped flare but they hit me at a weird place. hindsight, i probable should have ordered then one size up!",pos
This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.,pos
"I got this in an xs as the s sold out before i could purchase. i can still zip it at 27.5/28"" but would be more comfortable at say 26"". i'm almost 5'5"" and with 3"" heels it skims the floor perfectly. i'm so obsessed with the weight and texture! it is full and fabulous! i'll just need to slim down a tad so i can be comfortable at my sister-in-laws wedding next month. 
i wore a very fitted tank and it works perfectly! photographs well and feels very red carpet worthy.",pos
"I don't care because i like be it so much; but, make no mistake, it is not black but rather a dark navy. however please don't let this fall negatively on your decision to buy it. it's fabulous!",pos
"I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt, with long boots, booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!",pos
"Beautiful in person! highly recommend: great quality, beautiful design, flattering!",pos
"I saw this skirt at my local retailer store and thought it was just another corduroy skirt until i got up close and personal. it feels so soft yet there is structure to the skirt, hurray for a bit of spandex for movement. the first button is different from the rest of the buttons and i appreciate that type of details. only the wine color was available in the store and it is shown just like on the photo. the skirt falls right above my knees and size regular 4 fit me very well (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 3",pos
This skirt is adorable and has a beautiful pattern! it's also extremely comfortable. a total steal at the sale price!,pos

"I consider myself fairly busty (34 d), but i didn't have any problems wearing my normal size small/medium.....i actually went with the small. the lace inset doesn't give, but it wasn't tight at all. i love the flow of the blouse....it is going to be a great transitional piece into fall!",pos
"Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty, complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.",pos
"I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!",pos
"This is casual and comfortable.
along with soft touch of its textile, i also like the pastel color of flower prints. 
especially, i love the purple flower print with grey background (which is sold out already).
it also fits well with my body and makes look cool. 

it is perfect for everyday use.",pos

"In the on-line picture this lightweight sweatshirt looked so inviting that i decided to order it. when it arrived, i could not believe how soft and comfortable it felt! it was equally comfortable on. the rayon, tencel and cotton content of the fabric created such a comfy feel, that this top is sure to be a favorite for a relaxing week-end or evening. i ordered the size 3 even though i usually order a small in most tops. this one seems to lend itself to the oversized look, and i was right about t",pos
"Unfortunately, this sweater let me down! i love retailer, especially their sweaters, but this one fell flat. it was tight on the arms, and didn't hang well on my body. it was odd in length and added about 20lb to my frame. i kept it because i wanted to force it to work, alas, i just donated it. hopefully it fits someone else better than me..",neg
I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.,neg
Was looking for a cute off the shoulder top and this is a fun one. can be worn both on or off the shoulders. nice length and the pink is a beautiful raspberry color. love the linen blend too. i'm a size 2 and i ordered the xs. flows away from body - -it's a bit big but i like the style.,pos

Great jacket for a cool morning. not too heavy and i found it to run true to size. nice little details.,pos
I love this top. it comes with its own camisole. the embroidery is lovely and the fit is perfect.,pos
"This dress is incredible soft and flattering. it sits higher on the waist than most other dresses i've received from retailer, which is actually great for me, as i have a short torso. i have been able to put it in with the regular wash cycle, which was a pleasant surprise. the only issue was with the overlapping fabric on the top; i ended up adding an extra stitch to avoid being totally exposed.",pos

"This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time. i ordered it with the ""layered luna dress"" in grey, and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo! very chic. i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come. for reference, i ordered my normal size xs (5'5, 115 lbs, muscular) and did not find it to be too tight in the arms (and i have fairly broad shoulders). i did not try it on with long sleeves, but i still think there would be adequate room.",pos
"I saw this and tried to wait for it to go on sale, but it sold so fast, i wanted the black and i check everyday until they had my size, i love this coat main because of the wait it goes around the neck since i am not a scarf person, this is very cute, im glad i got it, even at the full price.",pos
"I love the design of this sweater...shorter length, with shorter sleeves.
goes great with jeans and has a very different look!",pos
Love this blouse! the color is really unique and love the back button detail. i dont think the white buttons look cheap at all as another person pointed out - they add a lot to an already beautiful top. can't wait to wear it!,pos
"I tried this on at the store and i agree with the other reviewwers on the sizing. instead of purchasing my usual size 6, i bought the size 8 as it was indeed a bit tight in the chest for my 34d chest but it was no biggie as they had my size. i love all the embroidery and lace, the length, color and detail on this one. it's also soft and made from cotton so it will be just perfect for summertime and will look adorable with tights and boots and a cardi or jean jacket in the fall:)",pos

I love this dress! easy breezy flowy comfortable & pink! fits a true medium ...would recommend to anyone. makes me a little flirty!,pos

"I loved this top when i first saw it. i tried on my usual size l, and there is no stretch through the bust, so it totally flattened my chest. a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl's that must have been returned. i tried them on and they fit perfectly! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest, this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap, skinny jeans and boots.",pos
Not just another striped tee. perfect drape & lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body & is super flattering. the subtle shimmer is just right. love the gray! very versatile & irresistible. i'm a size 4/small & this is tts.,pos
"This is my new favorite dress. while elegant it isn't too fancy for a nice office environment. very comfortable and a perfect size fit. i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee, not below since i am 5' 3"" but not a big deal. everyone has complimented this dress!",pos
I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.,pos
Love my mother jeans and these are super cute for spring! they fit tts. i'm 5'7 and i bought my normal 25.,pos
"The most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when you're 5'4"" is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off. not so with the petite 31"" inseam on these!!! love the perfect amount of stretch, the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect. definitely recommend.",pos
"This dress is a keeper. fits true to size, comfortable and love the pockets. it can be a casual day dress or add some jewelry for a night time dinner out. i was concerned with the fabric being a velvet material but is very light and comfortable",pos

Great fit and style. i got the navy and the color is beautiful.,pos
"I tried this on in the store, but almost didn't because i thought it would look like a sack. the dress looks so good. it fits nicely in the shoulders which gives structure and then the rest of the dress is roomy, but no so much it looks stupid. im 5'5"" and it hit above my knees by an inch or two.",pos
"Like others, i finally received my size 6p black pants after months of waiting.  for starters, these pants run small, so i ordered a size up but still in petite, because i adored the red ones i got this past summer.  when the black pants arrived, they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones (which were also 6p), and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality.  i'm debating ordering the regular length, but i'm not sure i'll bother, based on some of the other reviews.",neg
"I went with my instincts and grabbed a size l as opposed to my usual medium.  fits great and flatters the girls while hiding my meaty back!  such a great artistic design, i will love wearing it this weekend.  i am scared to wash it, i may just have to dip it in lingerie powder and drip dry.  for fit reference: 140#, 36dd, i hold my weight in my neck, shoulders, back, upper arms, tummy (i'm not a gorilla.)",pos

"Big bust, smallish waist... this top is so cute and flattering! absolutely love it",pos
"I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric. it's light, soft and crisp, which is perfect for summer days. the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso. the waste line is a bit high for me, but overall it didn't feel weird or look funny. there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with. once i tried it on, i had to bring it home with me!",pos
"This sweater is so soft, beautiful and well made. it runs just a bit large, but i love the look.",pos
"The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory, but the top in reality is more beige. well, i'm blonde with fair skin, so i'm not sure this is going to work. it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality -- i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy -- but in reality, with it really being beige, having pleats everywhere, and being a crinkly fabric, it looks more casual. i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts",neg
"Just bought this top today at our local store. it's just gorgeous on. i'm a 34dd and bought the size small and it fits perfectly. if you're small chested, you can probably size down as it runs nice and full for a larger bust. it's so feminine and pretty on. a must for any wardrobe.",pos
"I was really intrigued by this swimsuit when i saw it online but i wasn't sure how it would look on me but the reviews convinced me i should get it and figured if i didn't like it i could just return it. i love this suit, the color is beautiful and the high neckline is off-set by the open back. for anyone who has a large chest, which i do (32g), this is one of the most secure/supportive swimsuit i have ever tried on. do not hesitate to buy this suit, though i would go a size up if you have a lar",pos

I ordered this dress on a whim in my normal size 8 and if fits perfectly! i felt so pretty when i put it on. i love the volume of the skirt with the tighter top. it was very flattering to me. the linen thickness was nice but not for summer in florida maybe spring. but its lovely!,pos
I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone. i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste. i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake!,neg

"I found this top really flattering on. i originally ordered a 6 and found it a little too big. the 4 fit perfectly, it falls around your belly button area so a little of your stomach will show. it has a flattering scoop neckline and the ruffles give it that extra flare. very light weight for the summer, colors are brighter/better in person.",pos
"There is so much going on on this dress - it's fantastic. hard to tell from pics - but there is a peek-a-boo lattice detail going down the front and back of the sleeves. the beading is plentiful but not too much for work. dress is significantly longer on me than the model - i'm 5'6"", but still a tad above the knee. with tall boots or booties and tights, this will go straight from work to out for the evening. i'm real long waisted - originally ordered m, but exchanged for l. much better fit overa",pos
The top of this suit was not proportioned well. i am normally a 34c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium. the cup size on this was very small for a medium. the band to hook in the back was almost too big. there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup. the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back.,neg

Love this shirt. i am 5'8 and have a slender torso and the small fits perfectly. i love that it's long so you can wear it as a single shirt or use it as an extra layer. i also have a grey druzy necklace to dress this puppy up. purchased it in black and this will be a new staple.,pos

I bought this in white at my local store. great staple to wear in the heat of the summer or as a layering piece. i bought my normal size medium and it fits loose and flowy. i wore a nude racer back bra and felt comfortable without a cami. great basic addition to my closet.,pos

"I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red, as well! however, this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.",neg

i do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it. it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online. it doesn't look that ""oversized"". i can see where taller ladies won't go for the shortness but at 5'4"" that's just not an issue for me. the bottom is very flattering and doesn't do that ""long grandma butt"" that some rompers",pos
Really great pair of pants/leggings. considering a second pair. great flattering fit. i ordered the petite as well because i was concerned about the length but the stride on the petite a was to short and the regular was not too long after all.,pos

"This is one of those ""very retailer"" tops that you can't find anywhere else. the feel is ""folkloric"", but the country is not specific. although listed as a ""tee"", the material is a knit with heft and is lined (from the bust seam down). the embroidery is combined with cut-work to give it a high-end finish (and justify the price). this is a dress-up tee for sure. i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt. i wear either a 0 or 2 in mos",pos

"Love this skirt. purchased it in a 0 and it fit fairly good. sat high up on the waist, which i like. however, now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a 2. i think the 2 would have let it sit further down making it not so short. i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up (0 is my typical size in full skirts).",pos
"I picked this up on sale and was glad i did - the material is just the right thickness for some of the chilly days we have here in spring in the northeast. the fit is right on, but size up if you are unsure or inbetween. the detail down the back is adorable and adds a point of interest to this sweatshirt. the fit is boxy - but i think it compliments and balances the overall girly design.",pos

"I'm 5'3, i ordered the petite (nice to have this option), the length/volume doesn't overwhelm me as some kimonos do. this feels more like a fall-season kimono due to the fabric content. it is not a wispy fabric, there's weight and some stiffness to the drape, you can see on the model how the fabric stands away from her body. it's a different look from silky feeling kimonos that hug the body. a rich blend of blue, black, white, subtle tan, maybe some silver grey - hard to tell, the colors look li",pos

the style is classic with an unexpected yet still elegant twist.

"I think i'm on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit, because i love this dress. it may be because i don't have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others. it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesn't cling. i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail. confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little. i do have to wear a cami",pos

This dress is so much better in person. i would say it is tts but it was oddly baggy around the chest/armpit area which didn't deter me from keeping it. the biggest negative i have is that it is rayon but i don't think that'll change with retailers anytime soon.,pos

These pants lived up to expectations. the fabric is very soft and did not wrinkle in the dryer. i am normally not a big fan of cropped styles but love that these have the gathered leg and can be styled dressier or casual. i thought the cargo pockets might stick out too much but they lay nicely. i feel i will get a lot of use from these and the best part is they are not constrictive and they are super comfy.,pos

I wasn't expecting to love to this dress as much as i do.  the length and horizontal stripes (petite was sold out and my torso is square) are automatically two strikes but the sale-on-sale price was begging me to give it a go.  so glad i did!  the cut and flare are flattering.  the self to tie is slimming and can be styled different ways.  the regular length is doable when i wear platform wedges.  the colors scream summer and vacation fun.  my only problem is the feel of the fabric--liner is fin,pos

"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, cut, and softness of this dress. it can be dressed up or down, with or without leggings/tights, and is cute with boots or flats. my only complaint is that the sleeves are not near as long as what is shown in the photo. i'd say more like 3/4 sleeves. thankfully there is elastic at the cuffs, so the sleeves can be pushed up, and the the material can slightly drape over the elastic.",pos

It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,neg
I am petite but chesty and this dress is flattering. it is a loose fit but not tight across the bust line. i tried it on with nude shoes and it dresses it up. i ended up buying this dress in a regular cut (s) because i wanted it to not be so short which made it look more like a casual dress to wear with the ocean behind you. i think it is a perfect day dress to go anywhere and by changing your shoes or adding a thin sweater or short jacket you can go out to dinner or theatre. the picture is a tr,pos

because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt, i wouldn't recommend this to women who are busty/curvy on top. it made my chest look huge! this styling may work for petite ladies, but tall & curvy ladies beware.",neg
"Love this top-i love the colors, flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered. i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length. have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops. love love love.",pos
"I love the weight of this dress, the mod color blocking, the pockets, the detail down the side of the skirt, the cable knit, everything! i wear it with a caramel cardigan and brown booties, it's perfect. it's a sin to pass it up, especially for this price.",pos
"I grabbed this immediately when i saw it in the store - the details are beautiful - beading, embroidery, and small opening details on the arms. from a practicality standpoint, it has pockets, it's machine washable, and it can easily be worn as is, with black leggings or tall boots in fall, and then throw an additional chunky ivory cardigan on for winter. for sizing, i am usually a size s and found it to fit loosely, but in comfortable slightlyyyy swingy way. if i had sized down the shoulder seam",pos
I love this stylish sweater. i ordered black. it is very soft and comfortable. i wear it with snaps open or closed. looks great either way.,pos
"I really love this dress. the material has a lovely feel to the skin, silky. i typically wear a large (occasionally a medium). if i wanted this dress to look like the model it would be the large. i ended up going with a medium because i wanted to accentuate the smallest part of me (rib cage area). this made the black portion a tad snug around the bum, but it eased a bit with wear (but still tighter than model picture)
size down if you want it snug, normal size for a looser, boxier fit. either w",pos
"Love these jeans as they look great with dress shoes, running shoes or boots. fit well and true to size.",pos
You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!,pos
This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.,pos
"As the previous reviewer stated, this wrap is over sized but that is the style. the knit is soft and dense and the metallic accents are subtle and lovely. this is an heirloom piece that will last for many, many years.",pos
I love the raw edges on this t-shirt and the marled pink is a pretty color. the fit is not as oversized as you might expect from the photos. order your usual size. it's very soft and lightweight.,pos
"I bought this to wear for my baby shower at 34 weeks. i was able to buy it in my size and still get a great fit, and the skirt hits right at my bump with the band just above it. great option for expecting mothers that can be worn after baby, the top is also snug enough to feel like it covers properly (could be too snug if you are large chested though).",pos
"I've eyed this dress forever and finally decided to buy it. i literally read every single review to make sure i ordered the right size. i'm 5'4-3/4"", 36c-32-37 with a drop-waist that measures 34. based on the reviews, i ordered a regular size 6. i tried it on with a bra and also without, and the dress fits so well and beautifully both ways. but for complete comfort, i'll probably go without the bra (the lining and design don't show anything you don't want seen!). sitting in it feels great too. i",pos
"I saw an outfit post of a gorgeous lady in this dress so i had to try it. it's so flattering and well constructed, if a little longer than i usually prefer. i'll just have to wear pumps with it. i don't have the right bra so i just pinned the straps to a bit of ribbon in front to pull them underneath the dress. it does have pockets, also. i ordered the 12 and it fits beautifully. for reference i have a 40"" bust and 33"" waist.",pos
"This looks just as good in person as it does online.   true to size.  definitely warm, but not too heavy.  comfortable as well.",pos
"This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains. it is sturdy beautiful and strong. i looked like a large picture window in it. if i was 5'10"" and 120 pounds it may have worked ?",neg
This skirt is so cute. this is a staple to have in your wardrobe. i wear it with boots and boot socks. but tights for cold winter days as well as flip flops in the summer. i got my true size of 4. its fits perfectly. i love the length with a peek of leg when you walk!,pos
"I have several pairs of ag jeans and am always pleased with them. i had to get these when i saw them in the store. i'm a sucker for cuffed jeans in the spring. i also love the dark wash. i was surprised when i tried on my usual size 27 that they were too tight. i ended up going with a size 28. for reference i am 5'4, 122 lbs.",pos
This sweatshirt is very cute on. it works well with leggings or skinny jeans. it's the perfect thing to wear when you want to be comfortable but still look feminine.,pos
"This sweater is absolutely gorgeous! the green is a lovely, rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft. i love the slightly slouchy fit, but it's far from looking shapeless. i bought my usual size small (5'8"", 140, straight athletic build, size 4/6) and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heels.

i'm so happy to have tracked it down in our local store, i'd buy them all if there was more in stock!",pos
"Sheer top, runs big, usually i'm a size medium, but got small in these. 
very pretty! great summer top.",pos
"These are excellent. as previous reviewers noted, they are a thin material, and there isn't much stretch. that being said, they have a casual, work-appropriate men's wear vibe (the extra fabric in the crotch region contributing to this). if you really don't like the extra fabric, wearing them a little higher and closer to the natural waist should solve the problem. the navy is a little lighter in person than on the site, just fyi--it's less easy to mistake for black, which is alright in my book.",pos
"This shirt is the perfect go-to; classic white button down, with a twist! the fit is flattering & i would have to say runs a little large. i am 5'4,124 lbs, broad shoulders, with a 36d bust and bought the 2 (outside of retailer, a 36d usually needs about an 8). i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold & hung it up to dry & it was fine.",pos
"These run small (i am 110 and got a size 4), they were a tad tight on top. the waist fit but felt a little too snug, short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material. they are a dark blue animal print. i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle. they looked so silly i had to laugh. even with the 20% off, these are going back. not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person!",neg
"Today was my first visit to our new store! the sales person had this on and i liked the medium tones of the colors. many times i hesitate to order because i never know if the brand will run small and this does not. if you wear a medium in michael kors shirts, order medium.",pos
"Very nice soft fabric, has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in , sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.",pos
"I was nervous about this dress, as when i ordered it there were no reviews yet...and shortly after they, they started coming in and were only negative. yes it runs pretty big (i'm usually a large/12 but could tell from the model it would run big) but it's supposed to be loose. i wouldn't say it's the most flattering - but you can tell it's shapeless from the picture! it's a great casual dress, perfect for hot days when i don't want my clothing touching my skin.",pos
"Loved the dress on-line. ordered a petite small. fits perfectly. i am barely 5'5"" and carry my weight in hips and thighs. this fits perfectly without being too snug on the butt!! so, if you are a pear shape, get this dress!!",pos
"This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute, not flattering, the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend, although it looks airy and comfy.",neg
"I have bought several tees by t.la and this one is really cute. i bought it in the blue stripe size xs. it runs slightly larger than most in that size, but it will probably shrink a little. it's not overly baggy, just comfy fit. i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans. the fabric is thin so i'm not sure how long it will last, but until then it will be a keeper in my closet!",pos
This dress is flattering in so many ways. fitted through the bodice with a lovely flare from the waist down to cover those hippy hips. sizing is perfect. i also bought it in the navy/black color. you can dress up with heels or down with flip flops.,pos
This dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style. ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big.,neg
I'm in love with this print! the fabric feels wonderful- this is such a perfect transition dress! the adjustable waist tie makes the dress fit great!,pos
"I wish i had read more of the reviews....but thought i would give it a try. the shirt doesn't seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt. this would be ok if it was the length pictured, but since it isn't it makes you look very boxy. i don't know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made. wanted to love for fall.....unfortunately, i am taking back.",neg
"I bought this dress for an all white event. i had many compliments but it was the most fun dancing dress because the top layer spins out! it is loose and flowy but the arm holes are rather large and sizing down might have been better. i am 5'8"" and athletic and ordered a m and if i had time might have exchanged for a s. you must steam out creases before wearing.",pos
This is a great cold weather alternative to a coat especially in warmer climates. it is lightweight but dense. love the color.,pos
Can't love this dress enough. i have to force myself not to wear too often. i get stopped every single time i wear it to get complimented. i'm usually a size 6 or 8 in dresses. went with the 8 after trying both on. i found the arms fit better with the 8. i'm pretty athletic and 5'5' around 140 lbs.,pos
"The fabric is a little stiff, the back looks unusually long compared to the front, and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.",neg
"Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.",neg
I absolutely love this dress. the pattern is gorgeous and it is so comfortable. i have received many compliments every time i wear it. i will definitely start paying more attention to this brand when shopping retailer.,pos
"Really comfortable, great for casual event or everyday wearing. best style with jeans.",pos
"Rompers are my fav so i'm biased writing this review. although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing! the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape. yes, the first couple of buttons  are tough to get on but i'm guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier. i got my usual size 4 and it fit like it was made specifically for me. i'm very happy with this purchase.",pos
"The skiers, cats, and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns. unfortunately, the fit was awful. i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite. the skier fabric is also see-through. the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in, but it is not very long. 100% rayon fabric is a bummer too. the shirt was snug at the bicep, but not as bad as i expected from the reviews. i sized up from an 8 to 10.",neg
"I just received this top today, and as usual, retailer doesn't disappoint!! it's beautiful, runs a bit generous and has such pretty detail. i'm 5'2, 128 pounds and always wear a size small. this small fits well with just enough room to be a little generous around your waist. what a steal!! don't miss this perfect addition to any wardrobe.",pos
"Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.

i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.

i do wish they came in more colors.",pos
"Dare i say, this is my favorite pair of pilcro legging cords yet. the pattern is beautiful, with green, black, and grey. the fit is as usual stellar and comfortable. the best yet!",pos
This is the perfect holiday dress. my best purchase of the season!,pos
"I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide, short, and crooked. after it was washed once, it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong.",neg
You can't go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so don't agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think it's perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.,pos
"Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.",neg
"Love! received so many compliments! it can be dressed up or down and is so comfortable.  i did order a l  based on the reviews, but found it to be big.  i would've returned for a m, but it was sold out and i didn't want to risk not having it at all so i kept.",pos
"Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size. boy do i regret that! these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sit...not attractive. wish i could return them, but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand!! if in between sizes definitely size down.",neg
"Love this dress! very feminine and flattering. i would say that it runs true to size, or a little big. size down for a snug fit at the waist.",pos
I love this top. i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts. it can be dressed up or down. i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit. the button details in the back are such a nice touch. i got many compliments on this top.,pos
"This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too, but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!",pos
I bought this shirt in the turquoise color with the navy trim and love it! color is as pictured. shirt is very soft and flowy. the length was a little shorter than expected (the slits on the side almost reach the top of my jeans) so i'm glad i got the regular xs and not the petite. this shirt is unique without getting too crazy!,pos
"I love this sweater! it's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length. i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long, like i had hoped. the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo, but i actually like that even better.",pos
I ordered two sizes. when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin. both shirts were in the bag. the style is just okay. the shirt is extremely light weight. i was not impressed with the fabric. i am returning both. definitely did not think it was worth the price.,neg
"This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work, or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top.",pos
I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse. i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd. sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant. love the fit though. it fits lovely and comfy. it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe.,pos
This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!,pos
"I bought this skirt yesterday and love, love, love it!! very flattering, will go with anything. i am 5'5, 127, and size 6 fit perfectly.",pos
Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.,pos
I am not a bright clothing person but adore this top. if this is the right red for you i highly recommend.! it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones. it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back. has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil,pos
"This vest is awesome - the photo does not do it justice. you can dress it up or dress it down. great materials used. does run big, so select one size down!",pos
"I love this jacket. it is great for lounging because it is loose and comfortable, and it's great to have pockets to stash stuff in as i shuffle cozily around my house on cold, lazy days. it's not the world's most flattering fit (it's kind of boxy) but i bought it for comfort and i am delighted.",pos
"There is a reason everyone is giving this dress 5 stars. it is stunning, flattering, versatile and comfortable. i'm a slim, athletic size 4-6. my store only had one of these and it was a medium. i'm generally a small but on the hanger it looks like a slim tube so i thought i'd try it. fits fabulous. due to the stretch and shape of the dress i'd say a size medium could fit a 4-10. so, don't worry about sizing up or down one in this dress. suuuuuper stretchy so even though it fits close down throu",pos
This is a great shirt but it was big for its size. i'm also short so maybe the petite size would have fit me better,pos
"This dress is cute and comfortable. big but not too big, skimming. i usually wear a 12 pant and bought a medium and it is great. i am on the taller side and the length was great too.",pos
"Great top, for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline. i am 5'4 so can do it with top length, but not sure someone taller could. so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with. would probably look cute with skinny jeans, but i bought it for skirts. adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves. really love it, but more sheer than i expected. great with a nude bra, but probably would see other colors through it.",pos
It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph. it made my 5 foot frame look short and wide.,neg
"Cute but not sure it's worth the price point. i might reach for it in sale, and while it was cute on, i just don't spend that much on a daytime casual dress. i'm sure you could dress it up with heels or something but there's something about this dress that screams casual daytime. still very pretty and flattering! i loved the neckline and detailing there",pos
"Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. didn't need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag, and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said, but works with the dress.",pos
"I bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it! it's so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details, little metal buttons down the front, the vent pleats on the side; make it feel special. i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort. it was pretty true to size and because i'm an average height i wore a small block heel with it.",pos
Great casual weekend pants and super comfy and great color.,pos
"I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly, i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short, for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist, for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful, for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look, and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c",neg
"This dress is even more beautiful in person. it fits true to size and drapes nicely from the body without being tent-like, as some swing dresses are prone to be. the material is very nice and the pattern is stunning and unique. as someone else mentioned, you can pair this with a cardi for work. it's also perfect for a night out. it's easily dressed up or down. and looks amazing with a skinny belt. i'm happy i bought this one!",pos
"I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls. i was skeptical of the simple shape, but when i put on the green one, i didn't want to take it off-ever. i am 6' and thin- the small fits me perfectly. i loved it so much, i purchased the blue as well. love, love, love!",pos
Loved this sweater when i saw it online. when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured. despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell. the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside. it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell. hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi. it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy. i,pos
"This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out. the material is light weight, not flimsy. you could dress up or down. the bottoms are the perfect length. i'm a bit short-waisted, 5'7"",125lbs and the small fit.",pos
"I love this dress so much that i bought it in 2 colors: one in blue and one in orange. great style, comfortable and quality material. however, the cut is much, much deeper than it appears in the pictures. women with bust should be conscious of that. 

the blue is the better color. the orange looks more like a fluorescent, red-orange. still cute, but not as subtly muted as it appears in the pics. 

overall, great dress. even better with the sale price.",pos
"Super cute on.  i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable.    the slip is a tad tight, but it doesn't bother me, its stretchy so it's not uncomfortable.  i bought size xs-i usually wear a 2 in dresses.  i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about 2"" above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didn't need the petite.  i am 5'3"", 125 lbs.  i loved the soft fabric-fine for year round in southern cal.",pos
"This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning. it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off, but as long as i don't rip it one of these times all will be well! it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw.",pos
"The green is a deep, beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!",pos
Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.,pos
"I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely, the perfect work dress. i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out, so i visited another retailer, and another to find it. unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me, it seemed to overly accentuate it. i am 5'9"" a 36 dd size 12.
the colors, the fabric are all wonderful. but this dress is not for me.",neg
The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering. the back felt bulky and looked awkward. definitely returning.,neg
"I read the other reviews and from the picture it looked as though it may be a little short, so i ordered up to a large. the medium would have fit, but since i'm in my mid-40's i felt more comfortable with large. but if you are trim and young or young at heart your usual medium will be fine. live the material and the navy makes it classy and rich looking. can be dressed up or down. have worn it to a cocktail party fundraiser with blue crop pants and received many compliments. i'm always challenge",pos
"I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.",neg
I love these jeans. the fit is much better than the white pilcro hyphen slit jean which is cuts lower. nice weight. not to heavy and not too light in weight. these look terrific with the vanja peasant top in the yellow print. a darling outfit. the lace give them flair and dress them up so i can wear them to work. highly recommend!!,pos
"I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress",neg
Love this top! it's very simple modern design can go with many different bottoms and the soft pink color gives it a slight distinction from a plain white tank. love it!,pos
"I purchased the tan ""ish"" gray colored one in xs. it looks a bit mauve in the pictures, but is still very beautiful.. i like the drape of the fabric and the cats on the front. the one drawback is that the arms are very snug, especially the upper arm and chest. i have not worn it yet and am debating whether or not to exchange for the next size up. just have to get to my area retailer before they sell out of the size small.",pos
Beautiful dress. lots of compliments. will transition well from summer to fall.,pos
"This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size, great color. lot's of compliments.",pos
"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back!",neg
Beautiful color and super comfy. it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top.,pos
I took a chance buying online. i'm thrilled this dress clings at the top and releases where it should (below the bust) without looking like a tent. a very classy dress for work or play. just hope it holds up after a wash as the material is thin (but opaque). love this dress.,pos
This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas. it's light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out.,pos
"This dress is lovely.  it flows nicely and is extremely flattering.  also true to size.  unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glitter/sparkle, which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back.  wish i could pull off the glitter but can't.  i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it.",pos
"I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while. when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second. i love it. i've worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan. it travels nicely in the suitcase, no need to pull the iron out. i wear a cami underneath but it's really not that sheer so you don't need to. it's a lovely piece",pos
"This looks cute on the model but was way too big, loose and sloppy for me. i probably needed a petite size. i ordered a regular xs, but returned it. it is an okay black top, nothing great.",neg
"Wow. this is the perfect sweater. beautiful, soft color. lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons. it drapes beautifully. the knit is tight, no see through or snags. very soft and comfy. the casual, easy, pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style. am starting to love this designer. highly recommend.",pos
"Bra s great, but it has a lot of push-up padding. this might be nice for smaller cup sizes, but for a 34dd, it was a little overkill/unnecessary.",pos
"I love this blouse. it's really pretty and very flattering. it makes your waist look small. i usually wear a size 6 or 8. after reading the reviews saying it ran small, i ordered an 8 and a 10. the 10 fit perfectly, so i didn't even try the 8 on. it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side. that is my only complaint.",pos
"I bought the m/l (5'4"",130lb) and love the way it hangs and the length, and the fact that it can be worn over a lightweight top. the color and feel of the fabric are very nice.",pos
"This dress fits me perfect. the only complaint i have is that it was a little snug around the neck every now and then. it was a little snug getting in and out of the dress too. overall, the design is beautiful and it is definitely my new favorite.",pos
"I bought the navy color in xs petite. i'm 5'1, 115 w/ athletic build. i thought the fit was perfectly fine. with a belt, the dress is about 3 inches above my knee. the dress is made very soft/breathable fabric and has a ""slip"" underneath.  bonus: the dress is made in the usa! i'll be buying the white and red once they're marked down a bit more. very satisfied with this dress.",pos
"Tried this dress in a small. i am 5'6"", 135lbs, 34c. the small was huge - the sash helped some, but looked like a potato sack on me. also, i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store. i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store.",neg
This jacket is so adorable on! i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and it's hard to tell what it even looks like?! i've been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break. in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material. this definitely does not! it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality. the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater,pos
"Loved the sweater and the sale price was great, but i could not take the shedding! even after just trying it on the first time, my jeans and top had shedding all over them. this was 2 minutes, i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day. had to return.",neg

The dress is too loose and runs too big,neg
"All the positive reviews are right - the shirt is great! something not entirely obvious from the online photos is that there is a slit on both sides of the shirt. makes it even more comfortable and flattering. i wasn't sure how i was going to style this for the winter before i received it but as soon as i put it on i had plenty of ideas. it looks particularly great with a chunky scarf, leggings, and boots. it looked great with a close fitting turtleneck underneath. it really can be dressed up or",pos
"I ordered a xxs as i am a size 0. it fits very well, i am 5'5"" and the dress hits me 2 inches above knee. i would wear this with thick tights and boots. the sleeves are unlined, but because the material is of high quality, it does not seem too shear. you can belt this dress if you do not like the loose, swing style. i love the print and colors. i was not really aware of the silver sequence at the hem, but i do not mind it. however, i feel it does dress it up taking it out of the every day wear c",pos
"If any of you have read the book or watched the movie ""sisterhood of the traveling pants"" then you will understand this analogy. i am convinced that this dress hugs everyone in the right places. it looks kind of boring on a hanger, but has an incredible fit that complimented my waist so much. i instantly felt tinier in every trouble area of my body. although the design of this dress is casual, i feel that it can easily be dressed up for a nice brunch or meeting. i love basic clothing designs tha",pos
"I love this dress.i have it in black and am about to buy it in the blue..i'm usually a 4 but i bought a size 2. it is light and flattering with the gathering above the waist....does tend to crease a bit, but it's not too bad. love the way it can be dressed up or down (think boots or vans or sandles). i will dress it up to go out, but also throw it on to pick the kids up from school.",pos

"Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.",pos

many compliments on this top.",pos

i was worried it might look like a ""sack"" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner.",pos
I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.,neg

"I wanted this tank to work so badly! it was a great deal and so beautiful. unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake. my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short. if you have a short torso, this would work great. if not, unfortunately, its not great - tear",neg
I ordered my usual size; however when it arrived it appeared to fit a 9 year old! the color and style are adorable. i will need to exchange it for 2 sizes larger! i am so shocked at maeve's sizing.,pos

"I love wide-leg linen pants and i'm always in the market for them. i've purchased these in two colors and have been happy with them so far. the waistband is fold-over and snug. not too tight or too loose. the length is longer than advertised. i'm 5'10"" and typically take a 33.5 or 34"" inseam. these are long enough for me so they have to be a 33"" at least. others may complain, but i'm happy!",pos
"Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering.",neg
"I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...15 years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year, but this kind of boxy, straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however, i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off, i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses, with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet), and i love it.",pos

This is my first pure+good piece. i am not disappointed. i am 125# and a 34c....ordered the small. fits like a dream. love the moss color. nice long sleeves (i will am picky about sleeves). comfortable fabric. the detail at the cuff is lovely. i can see this versatile piece taking me through the entire year.,pos
"So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color, but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring.",pos
"These jeans have definitely made me an ag convert. the fit is perfection and at 5'3"", it is so to buy jeans and simply wear them (without the typical extra 4-6"" of length).",pos
I really liked the style and fit of this shirt but i'm giving it a 2 because i shirt should last longer than 6 months. i've taken it to the cleaners 2 times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes.,neg
"This is a beautiful summer dress. i especially love the exposed back which is the perfect cut to not show your bra and feels professional enough for work. plus it's comfortable, drapes nicely, and is machine wash and dry.",pos
I bought this cardigan in both rose and nude and i absolutely love both! the weight is perfect for spring and fall and i love the details in the back and the pockets. i thought the rose would be hard to match for tops but i have a number of things that work with it. it fits true to size in my opinion.,pos
"This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website. the style is very flattering, fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare. i am 132 pounds, 34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great. the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me. the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress. this one is a keeper.",pos
"I was so excited for this dress to arrive, but when it did, it was a major disappointment. there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer. also, the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way. the colors were beautiful, but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws. i am 5'6"" 140lb and the small fit tts. will be sending it back",neg

"I can't get enough off-the-shoulder tops. so even though this is out of season, i went for it...in both colors! my only con is the fabric has a slight sheen which cheapens the look a tad. like i'd read in other reviews, it does run a bit small for this cut top - i just wanted a bit more volume in the neck hole and in the waist since i won't be tucking in. if you want it more fitted and ruched around the waist, go for your normal size. i'll be ordering a small in both colors because i know i won'",pos

This is such a cool top/sweater. i like simple designs with a twist and the sleeves add that. great with skinnies and heels,pos
"Love the blue color, different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff, but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.",pos
I love the color and shimmer of this dress. it is very unique and one of a kind. the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor. it's a great dress!,pos
"This top did nothing for me. it billowed in the front and was not flattering. for reference, i am 5""4, 115 pounds, and small chested. i ordered the smallest size the top came in (cannot recall if it was an xs or 0). i promptly returned it.",neg
"I never write reviews, but these socks are so worth it! they are incredibly soft, stretchy, and hug your feet just tight enough where you don't even realize you're wearing socks, but they aren't too tight.

i wash them straight away after wearing so i can wear them again. you won't regret it. true to color!",pos
"Overall, quite good red skirt, though a little clingy material. good that it has lining. the waist is elastic. xs fits great on me (5'4"", 120lbs).",pos
These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.,pos
This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.,neg

I've read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but i'm so happy i did! i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap. it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining.  however i think it depends on the person. because neither of those things actually bother me. i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy.  i think it's extremely comfortable and looks very cute on.  the zipper d,pos
I purchased this dress in the store and then realized i could get a petite size. i ordered it in a pm but had to return it. i reordered it in ps and it's perfect. i love it for a casual evening out of wearing around town in the summer. it's supper figure flattering.,pos
"I saw this online and thought the idea was super cute, but was not sure if it would be worth the money because it looks typical. but, when i went to the store to try it on, i saw it was anything but typical. the fit is perfect and the fabric so soft. i wanted the dress in the green, but they were already sold out in my size at the store, so i had to order it online. i cannot wait until it comes in! i will wear this often during the summer.",pos
This kimono is gorgeous and i've gotten many compliments. it looks good with a t-shirt and jeans or with something dressier. i love it.,pos

"This sweater dress is lovely, quirky and comfortable. because i have broader shoulders, the neckline was perfect on me, although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm! the dress skims in a very flattering way. at first i was dissapointed it wasn't more formfitting, but it drapes very nicely.

This is exactly what i was looking for! a simple black blouse to pair with a bold pair of pants or skirt. falls nicely and the material is quite stretchy making it super comfortable.,pos
"This coat is beautiful! i love the color and the design. it definitely runs a little large. i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem. i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already. the vest keeps it warm, but the sleeves aren't lined so it's cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if you're going to be in cold weather.",pos
I put on this t-shirt and my husband said it makes you look old. he was right. i'm not sure if it's the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too. perhaps on someone else it would look different. the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking. it may look better on someone taller.,neg

"This coat is wonderful. it's boxy and drapes really nicely. the colors are beautiful and versitile. i love the pockets. the fabric is sturdy, but not heavy. i have nothing but good things to say about this coat. i had to return it, sadly, since it wasn't flattering on my hourglass shape.

Tts and very feminine and flattering. looks same as on model. love this style. if you like style highly recommend . armholes not too big- yay!,pos
"I ordered these in the pinkish color, and i love them! i'm 5'8"" 140 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. they are definitely sheer, but they're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected. these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini, bandeau, or even tankini. the price is great, especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms. no pockets is the only negative.",pos
I love this jacket. it's the prettiest and most stylish jean jacket i've ever owned. the sleeves run small. i'm an xs but chose a small so i can button it and wear thin sweaters underneath.,pos
I've wanted a vest for the past few years and could never find the perfect one until now. the material is perfect and the colors are amazing. it's definitely a vest that you can wear all year. i would 100% recommend this.,pos

"This is my third marrakech jacket in as many months. i love it! i was hesitant to order it because of the beige color. luckily it is more of a green beige. it is a very flattering jacket and yes, you do want to size up. this jacket is so comfortable i usually leave it on when i get home because i don't want to take it off. i am 5'5"", 34 b and the medium fits great!",pos
"I agree with the other reviewer, this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen. it is kind of stiff with a little give, a perfect a line. the waist is a little tight so i sized up, usually wear a 2 and the 4 was perfect for me. wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one.",pos
"This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it. i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available. the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed. however, the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky. i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering.",neg
Really comfortable dress to wear.  pretty flower design.  good fabric and ribbon details are well placed. thankful it came with a cotton under slip because it's very sheer fabric and i didn't have to think of  what to put underneath.  have worn it twice since it shipped and i'm really happy with my purchase.  online order and shipment was super fast too.,pos
This dress is so cute and so comfortable. i will be wearing this to a lot of different kind of events. i am so happy with this purchase.,pos
Love this sweater. it fits exactly as shown on the model. the neckline is simple and stylish. the a line fit is very flattering. i normally wear a size xs to s. i purchased the s for more swing at the bottom.,pos

I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top. unfortunately the folded top portion doesn't stay down at all. i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up. the material is also not the best.,neg
I really like the gentle flow of the fabric. this top can be worn casual or dressy by adding jewelry or or a scarf.,pos
I would've looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on. the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy. i'm usually a m but went with the s b/c it looked better fitted. this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy. i can't wait to wear. would look great with white jeans!,pos

"The fabric and color is stunning. very well made. i'm 5'8"" and this romper works fine. it is long enough in the body. true to size. love it!",pos
Beautiful lightweight cardigan. the sheerness is really pretty. ordered one for my sister too!,pos
"Really nice thick fabric, yet lays really nice. scarf included, love the poncho style. will get me throught the end of pregnancy and will look great after as well!",pos
"This is a beautiful dress. figure-hugging but covered up in places that need it. color is flattering and soft. wore with bainbridge layered necklace. bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps. so versatile, will work for church or cocktail party.
great purchase!",pos
"I love this jacket over a dress! it's snug fitting so can't wear anything bulky under it, but super stylish and comfy stretchy material. it's a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me.",pos
"I ordered this in a s (for reference, i am 5'7"", 128-130 lb, 32dd, with a 27"" waist), and it fits nicely. i have a fairly large chest, but i didn't find that the pleats laid awkwardly or over-accentuated my boobs, but i got the purple motif so the pattern (and the higher neckline) may have helped keep the top looking cute and stylish but still modest. on me the top drapes a little more than than it does on the model, but it's flattering and not at all sloppy thanks to the fabric, which has a jus",pos
"I tried this on in the store and loved it. it runs large. i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, very short waisted, and i got the xs. i realized it had a sheer section on the side, but the store paired it with a beautiful scarf that helped cover the sheerness. i didn't feel i needed a cami while wearing the scarf. plus the scarf will keep me warmer and let me wear the shirt a little longer in the fall.",pos
"Normally, hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out, the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra, you get to see the whole side of it. secondly, the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra, too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle",neg

Material cheap. too small. good idea for design. love princess cut but bad material. good idea though. sending back,neg
I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.,pos
"I love these pjs! i thought $100 for the set was a little too pricey for me but as soon as they went on sale i knew i had to have them! they are so light and fresh, perfect for the texas heat! it helps that the print is absolutely precious as well!",pos
"I'm a size 2 in retailer pretty much across the board - size 26/27 bottom, 2 top, generally go for the xs. and i ordered this in a 4 based on other reviews. it's definitely not a winter coat, which i understood. it's not for layering over a heavy sweater either. i wish i had ordered the size 2 instead so that it was a little snugger in the waist. as is i can wear it over a shirt, dress, or light sweater, and that's fine, but unlike other reviewers i don't think you need to size up if you want the",pos
"Was hopeful this might work on my petite pear shape (i am 5', probably 135-140lb; one to two sizes larger on the bottom) when i first saw online so went to store to give the regular size a trial run before ordering the petite size online. you can never tell with these flare dresses - some just make the hips look so much worse and haven't had a lot of luck with casual retailer flare dresses this season. first tried on the medium and fell in love instantly - was looking a little big but thought orde",pos
"Such an easy to wear and nicely cut summer dress. it does not wrinkle, has pretty colors and fits very well. i haven't washed it yet, but i like the idea that it can be machine washed. highly recommend. the fabric is good quality, a little bit thick for hot days though.",pos
I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.,pos
"I've been hesitant to try on rompers, in part because they seem complicated and i also too worry that i would look a bit like mutton disguised as lamb in one of them! however, i saw this romper and fell in love with the pattern and had to try it on! 
the pattern and color are wonderful, and i instantly felt glamorous, like betty grable in a cute cheesecake photograph! i had to buy it, and have since received tons of compliments on it (and i have yet to feel that i am too one foot in the grave t",pos
"There's something wonderful about this tee. it's the way it fits. it hangs so nicely and is a wonderful year round item. i bought it in black for myself and one for my daughter. she ordered another color and i did, too. when i bought it, one of the gals at the store said it had been such a popular tee this year and, once i put it on, i understood why. i give it a high rating!",pos
"I bought this sweater in the gray color and love it! it is so very comfortable, very soft. it looks great with jeans or leggings.",pos
"I received this coat today and i'm ecstatic about my purchase. i am a true petite, and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly. i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews. yes, the button is low, but that is the style. i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short. otherwise, the fit may be completely off.",pos
"This dress is just what i was looking for. i ordered it in late summer. it was back ordered and i ended up wearing it on thanksgiving day! it's so comfortable, and just the right length. i wore it with leggings and boots, but it will be just as great with sandals in the spring.",pos
"This is a very flattering pencil skirt. i found it in the store and bought an xs, and have been wearing it to work. it is not too short, and the wrap fit looks great.",pos
"Love the patterns and the length.  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets. 
it's really a special piece and on sale, very worth it!",pos
"I love this jacket. something to get cozy in on cool california winter nights, and still light enough to wear open and walk around without getting too hot. i am 5'3' and have a medium frame but 34 dd on top. i bought a medium because i hate things to be tight around my chest, and this is perfect. my only disappointment is that i wish it had pockets. i got the wine color and it is very beautiful. wonderful, unique and comfortable jacket. i do recommend it.",pos
"I purchased the poppy tunic in gold - it's a beautiful rich color - and overall am super happy with the cut of this sweater. retailer has been emphasizing oversized, flouncy tops for a few years now that do nothing for those of us with small waists/big booties - this top is just the opposite and i hope to see more like it. the wide neck is graceful and the sweater curves in nicely without hugging the body.",pos
"Best beachy summer tunic in the store. can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight. can be worn over jeans, shorts, a bathing suit, take your pick. wear it with a tank/cami underneath or not. it works wither way. asymmetrical cut. great for us long-legged tall people. fabulous buy. only con is that it's a tad delicate. unfinished hem and loose-knit. will easily snag if you aren't mindful. i recommend hand wash, air dry.",pos
"I loved this on the cover of the august catalog. when i saw the pictures online, i was a bit hesitant because the background of the dress looked white, and i wondered whether it would be too washed out for me. not so. i love it! it fits beautifully; the waistline is very flattering. it looks like a dress a model would wear in the 1960s -- not a hippie, but a model in a high fashion magazine. it looks great with boots. the fabric is soft to the touch, so luxurious. i am of polish and lithuanian d",pos
"These are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings. i am 5' 8"" tall and 127lbs. i bought a s/m. they very soft and warm. they stay up perfectly, and do not pinch or make any lines. i am amazed that they are so inexpensive. i am buying 2 more after this review!",pos
"Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit",neg

"This is a very pretty summer top. the detailing at the neckline adds interest, and the floral pattern is gorgeous! one note: in the picture, the top appears to have a white background, but it is actually more of an ivory/cream color. this is definitely a swing top style with a lot of room in the body. i am 5' 8"", 145, and normally wear a medium or 6 in retailer tops. i ordered a small in this top, and it fit great at the top but was almost too large in the body of the top. i am considering",pos
"I bought this on a whim because the colors were so me and fell in love with the bows and button back. i wore this over a lace peplum and opened up the bottom buttons of the button back for a fun layered look. true to size, as i was in my normal size small (5'5"", 135lbs, 34c). definitely check this out in person.",pos
"I bought this dress to wear as a casual summer staple. i like classic things with a twist, and this fits the bill. it is nice quality, and the colors are vivid. it is slightly tight in the bust line for me, but it is not retailer's fault that i am a bit too busty for this dress. i'll deal with it. otherwise, the dress is nice quality, and will come in handy throughout summer. the price is right, so grab it!!",pos
"The first thing i noticed upon receiving this dress is how soft it is and the fact that it wasn't wrinkled coming out of the packaging bag- an excellent quality! my next surprise was to find that it is fully lined with a very nice soft knit and felt awesome on. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly- it was fitted through my waist and hips (37 chest, 28.5 waist, 37 hips) and dropped straight from my hips just like i like. i was afraid it would be too sheath like for my figure but it is perf",pos
"This is a beautiful shirt. dressy, imo. it's tts, i would not size down in this shirt. can wear w/ black, white, moss, khaki, jeans, etc... love it.",pos
Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.,neg
"This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store. color is vibrant, but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily. i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived. the top is very wide and best to wear strapless.",neg
"Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is, and heavy,.and itchy!  you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top (with your arms not touching any part of the top!  the sequins will itch if you put your arms down (underneath the armhole).  another reason i didn't like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable.  i would have to get mine tailored for my 5'2"" frame.  i usually wear a medium or 6/8 in tops and ordered this in a medium, it was roomy.",neg
"Love love love this in the pink! not as big a big of the off-white, but it's nice too.",pos
"I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10""), but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants.",pos
"I tried on almost every dress in the shop today, and this is the dress. as soon as i tried it on i started twirling around. i felt beautiful and i couldn't stop smiling. my mother said that it makes my blue eyes glow. it flatters my figure by hanging perfectly across my bust-line, floating over my curves, and camouflaging my little unappealing bumps. also, the dress is cut nicely under the arms which allows coverage for a strapless bra. i chose the medium size even though i usually wear a large",pos
"I ordered this dress in a size 8, my normal size at retailer. it is a lovely dress and so feminine, but it is incorrectly sized. i couldn't begin to button it. i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything. buyer beware. unless you are itsy bitsy, you need to size up. i will say that as pretty as the photos are, the dress is even more lovely in person.",neg
I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style.,pos
Nice top; the material is soft and drapey. i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket.,pos
"This dress had an odd fit. very loose on top with pointy darts, very tight on bottom. fabric was stiff so it didn't move well with me",neg
Love this jacket.  it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time.  i was surprised at how affordable it was.  my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color.,pos
"When i first saw this online, i knew i had to have it. so, when dresses were 25% off, i grabbed the deal! it's perfect. it's super soft and an appropriate length. i love the bell sleeves-they're ultra feminine and slightly trendy, but not too much! i definitely recommend this dress! reference: 5'7, 140ish lbs--size 27 in jeans, xs/s/4 in tops and dresses and the small fit me better than the xs.",pos

Cute little sleep mask! the elastic band is wide so it doesn't ever feel like it's digging into your head. does a very good job keeping out light.,pos
I love this brand and the 8 fits perfect. i am typically an 8 in retailer skirts and this is no exception. medium to heavy weight soft denim which is more of a darker denim shade with a wide a-line cut. the pockets are distinct and give the skirt character. it is pretty long and full looking on my 5'4 inch height. i purchased this on sale plus promo and very happy i was able to receive it as it became a sold out style in my size. the hem is a wide stitch hem and gives it a nice look. i look forwar,pos
"So beautiful! fabric hangs great, lovely detail, fits well and feels great",pos
I love this cozy jacket. i wanted a neutral colored jacket for casual outings. this does fit true to size. i am 5' 2'' and 105 pounds. i purchased the xs. you can cuff the sleeves to shorten the length of the arms. it has a piping so it doesn't look odd if cuffed. i do find most things/brands at retailer run big on me but not this item.,pos
"I ordered online and got it home tried it on and loved it. it is too cute i plan to wear it with bright colored belt and shoes probably red, yellow, or pink plus i bought a polka dot tote same color cream and black and a blazer can't wait to wear it. i love the fact that i can wear it spring, summer, fall as well winter with my blazer. i'm keeping it.",pos
This was the best purchase of the summer. it's cute and comfortable without being too baggy/loose. i get compliments every time i wear it. fits true to size. i bought the floral (orange) one. couldn't be happier!,pos

Extremely soft and comfortable. fit very well. should travel really well.,pos

"These pants are simply darling! i purchased them with my birthday discount (thank you, retailer!) and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny. flattering, and the most important feature of any pant, makes my butt look good. don't hesitate, buy these today before they are out of stock. 

the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality.",pos

I love the way this top fits and the way it flows. i have it in two colors.,pos
"This top in the remaining blue - green is not the top pictured.  it's like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland.  the color is deep and beautiful.  the neck is high, the lace is floral, there's a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it.  there's no reason for hesitancy at the sale price.",pos
I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move. you can't lift your arms. i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas.,neg
I got this jacket in the gray. the fit is amazing and it is soooooo comfortable. i love that it is a bit less structured - but still looks polished.,pos
"I bought this dress in the green color and i am absolutely in love with it!! it is very figure flattering and looks great even though i have a larger bust. it is also a great length, hits about an inch or two above the knee. highly recommend!!!",pos
"This is a very beautiful dress, with the detail of the inside lining, with a very beautiful fabric as well, creating a double layer effect, it creates a great flow. i am not sure i would use it with the belt (which is beautiful, a part of it is crochet), but if i don't, the dress would be too long. i am a size xl and 5'6"", so if you are shorter than that, i would try it before buying it. since it's getting cold here in colorado, i'll have to wait for next year to really experience going out with",pos

"I knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section. it's effortless. love the quirky design and the overall fit. it's a tad on the large side, but i'm all about the flow these days. oh, and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge. fantastic piece.",pos
Purchased this in two sizes because other reviews said it runs small. i found that it was true to size for me .cant wait until it is warm enough to wear it!,pos
"I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.",neg
"I have the pink plaid pippa and this mint one is nothing like it, but in a good way.  shorter, sweet embroidery but the same swing silhouette and drop waist style.  this dress is a little oversized so if you want more fitted look, you can size down.  stay tts if your busty like me.  imo, the mint looks more sky blue than green.  i got the medium regular and i'm 5'3"" 140# 36dd and ends at my knees.",pos

I agree with the others...this is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago. i love my new sweater. i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath. the sleeves are itchy.,pos
"I'm usually a fan of maeve, but this dress is just bad. the fabric is thin and filmy, and it stretches to sheer over your chest. the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose, it just droops in a most unfortunate way.",neg

"I absolutely love mother jeans, but i unfortunately had to return these ones. this particular style seemed to run pretty small. too, i always size up in white jeans, and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight. i typically wear a 28 in mother, and ordered a 29 in these.",neg

A sales associate handed these to me while i was trying other things on. i had never tried the hoxton before. i have found my perfect black jean! they are so comfortable and they don't stretch out like others i have tried.  i am 5'4 and i roll them a few times but i like that look. i am usually a 25 and that is what i took in these.,pos
"After being tentative to splurge on skinny jeans (i've always been a small flare jean-girl), i am thrilled to say i love these jeans. the rise is perfect in that it ""holds in"" anything you want ""held in"" and makes a slim shirt look even better. i have worn them with booties and regular boots alike and have no complaints. i was unsure of the jean's claim to not stretch out but have been pleasantly surprised at how they have kept their shape...even after sitting for many hours at a time. wash cold",pos
"I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it. she was absolutely right - the color is completely different in person. it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn. it's too bad, because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch. maybe the blue is better in person...",neg

"The design of this sweater is odd. it made me feel very ""round"" when i put it on. the sleeves were wide. the other reviewers were correct in saying that it's a thick sweater, which i thought i'd like. the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected. it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater.",neg
This is a beautiful color and nice heavier fabric. love the style. armholes not too big. the body is loose fitting at torso but chest area is fitted at 36 c size small . i love this top with skinny jeans or pencil skirt as shown on model. top looks just like it does on model as far as fit.,pos

"This is a great piece to add to your wardrobe! the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great. i got the pink, which surprised me because i wear so much black. the length fits longer than most rompers, which is great. it makes it a classic fit. i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up- the waist has elastic, but it's snug.",pos
This top would have been better if it had a stretchy  fabric. being large breasted makes this top a little tight. still so pretty so i'm keeping it. makes me look a little less chesty.,pos

"I love this skirt. it does run a little small, i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist, but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids, and they all love it as well.",pos
"I love these jeans! another winner in the pilcro line. i took a size 29. i normally wear a 30/31 depending on cut. i am 5'4 inches and about 150 lbs curvy with small waist and the 29 fits comfortably and very flattering to my figure. love the button front and the red details . i recall having jeans like these about 15 years ago and this cut is so perfect , cute and stylish. the regular length hit just slighting above the center of my foot so wearing with flats will be perfect, i am not a high he",pos
This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday. i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back. the colors are beautiful and rich. i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season. the top does run a little big. i sized down to a medium. i am just under 5'5 and am a 36g.,pos
"I ordered a small, which is my usual retailer size, but this was like a tent on me. it's fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasn't what i was looking for. also it is very long, a very weird amount of long. also there is only eyelet on the front. the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric. i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing.",neg
"I have wanted a fleece jacket for ages (for warmth and practicality), but i'm not the sporty type. this is the perfect alternative! i got it in wine and use it over a cardigan and dress or jeans. it is a lovely color and passes as wool. this is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. highly recommended. btw, it runs quite big. i'm generally a medium to large but the small is perfect on me.",pos
"I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly they're amazing. they look just like the picture, feel great on, don't slip in the waist. zero negatives. i can't wait to wear these bad boys out.",pos
"I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose, flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9"" and i'm under 5' 6"" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it",pos
"I'm always searching for a ""dressed up tees"" and these were fabulous! true to size and great quality!",pos
"I saw this dress in the store window and had to try it on and it is perfect! it's lined, got pockets, can wash at home, and is a work appropriate length. it's cold in the northeast right now, so i'm wearing it with tights boots and a cardi. i really like that it isn't fitted, but is form flattering. overall win!",pos
This skirt is hot. i love it and would marry it if possible. super pretty. the jewel hem looks awesome. buy it! we can be twins.,pos
I bought this for myself and my mom and we both love it! i got it in a small and almost wish i had gotten it in an xsmall. it's super comfy and appropriate for work.,pos
"This dress is made well; the construction/sewing details give the dress a beautiful shape. it has a nice zipper at the back, and fabric feels light. pockets are a good size. skirt flows, but doesn't feel heavy. fit is comfortable. i typically wear somewhere between a size 4/6. i ordered a 4 and it fits just right. i'm 5""6 and it falls below my knee--length is nice. armholes are a bit lower than i thought, but not too low. it's a classic/modern look. it was sold out when i first wanted to buy it,",pos
"This dress can be casual, or you can dress it up for going out. i just love this dress!",pos
I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.,pos
"This dress is amazing. nice material, comfortable and really flattering. slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect. highly recommended!!!",pos
"Can easily be worn with boots or sandals - multi season dress. comfortable, flattering cut. slightly roomy, but pretty true to size.",pos
"I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it. seemed high maintenance. also, didn't love the fit. color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top.",neg
Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.,pos
Love this sweater! it feels so soft and it slides right on over the head and neck. easy to wear. this is my favorite sweater. i wear it all the time. the lilac is a really nice subtle color as well. meant to be roomy.,pos
This is the perfect fall/winter sweater. i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it weren't sold out in my size. love it!,pos
These are such beautiful cheerful shorts. the floral motif just makes me smile. they do have brocade on them which is nice and dressy. they are perfect for a night out or a day at the beach. i went tts on them. i purchased similar shorts last year in the brown color. very nice shorts to have in your wardrobe..,pos
"Missed these last year in black, so snatched them up when i saw them this season! great,versatile wardrobe piece - dress them up or down with knee-hi boots, booties, or great heeled pump with silk blouse or sweater. love something that i can wear so many ways, and look and feel polished and put together.",pos
"I bought yellow one, and i'm very happy with this purchase. the flower print is beautiful, and the material is light, but not too thin. i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottom.
i'm pretty short in height and size 36c. i bought a m in regular size because i like my tops roomy, and it fits really nice, i just tie a small knot on the bottom of this top or tuck the shirt in a little bit, it works perfect.",pos
"Beautiful dress that is well constructed. the fabric is substantial and feels expensive.i am 5'4"" and weigh 134, 
36 bust 29 waist and ordered the m/l. i usually wear a 6-8 in dresses, so i worried that it would be too big but it fit perfectly. i am very happy with my purchase.",pos
"The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4"" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick, stretchy and well made. however, the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great",neg
"I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4"", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular.",pos
"I love this skirt... i have it in black, and when i saw this color i was so excited to add another one to my wardrobe. these skirts are made  well... it's not flimsy at a all. the actually color is more of a light aqua blue, so if you are wanting a baby blue might not be for you...",pos
"I tried this top on in the store before i ordered it online. i'm a size 2/4 (varies), and i ordered it in a size 2. i've been searching the perfect, fitted, white, button-down blouse for weeks, and i love this top! it's figure flattering, true to size, and a cute, classy alternative to your basic white button down. i can't wait to wear it! =]",pos
"This is a gorgeous piece of clothing - true to size, simple yet flattering lines, very comfortable. it has such flattering little touches as well, such as the detail work on the sleeves. love it, love it, love it! i just wish it were machine washable!!",pos
"I have been needing a perfect go-to white tee for layering purposes and this one met and exceeded my expectations. it's the perfect weight for year-round use, love that it's 3/4 sleeves (again great for year round), and the slight front v adds a nice special touch. fell in love with the first one i bought online, so ordered a second for backup. it's a winner (and great price)!",pos
I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it's color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go,pos
Surprisingly flattering and so very soft and comfortable. have had many compliments on this. super cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. also purchased the ausaria infinity scarf in navy which contrasts nicely with this top. and a plus--no signs of pilling yet.,pos
"I really wanted to like this top, just got it in mail today, but unfortunately it did not work well for me because i'm 6 ft tall and the blouse was too short. i like the look and how it feels and i haven't completely decided whether to return it, but here are the issues i have encountered with this top. the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color, very soft too, unusual for rayon of this type, feels more like thin delicate cotton. i got my top in red, size",neg
"Really cute piece, but it's huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning.",neg
"Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs, you won't be disappointed!",pos
Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.,pos
"I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing, the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also, the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss",neg
"Maeve consistently nails pencil skirts - i always know exactly what fabric and fit to expect, and it is flawless! the fabric is soft, lined, and has stretch. it feels as close to wearing sweats as you can in a skirt! the colors are beautiful on this - i'd say in person the colors are a bit deeper and richer than they show in the model photo. length is about the same on me as it is on the model at 5'7"" and got my usual s with no issue. this beauty will go with lots of different colored tops too,",pos
"I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews. although it did fit, i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms. i returned for a medium (my usual size) and it was perfect. it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics. i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets!!!!! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments. highly recommend!",pos
"As a teacher, it's so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful, that i can wear to work, as well as on the weekends.",pos
Superb quality and design. i am a 34d and 120lbs. i am a size 6 to 8 but mostly 8 due to my hips and top. i am pear shaped and 5'6. the dress was a little loose but i just need to get it a little fitted but you can hardly tell. i love the floral patterned so intricate. it truly looks like a princess dress. it is little heavy and at least it's not too tight for dancing.,pos
"Love these sateen jeans. they are a bit more polished than regular, flat black jeans, but not too shiny. i am 5'9"" and always wear a 27 in ag jeans and these were consistent with my usual size and fit perfectly. the mid-rise is very comfortable and the length on me is about the same as on the model (hits above my ankles). they're easy to dress up or down, and i have a feeling i'll be getting a lot of use out of them.",pos
"I got this in navy and love it. the overall shape is sleek and classic - body skimming but not tight - with subtle detail in the knit design that make it entirely unique. the quality and weight of the cashmere is perfect - not to heavy or light. xs fit perfect on my 5'5"" petite frame. but busty or longer-torsoed people may find the length a bit short - it hits me right at the top of regular low-rise jeans. this may be my favorite retailer buy of the season.",pos
I bought these cords in another color last year and they are my favorite pants. they are so comfy and keep their shape very well. when i saw they were back i had to buy another pair. i purchased navy and the color is beautiful.,pos
I love these pants! so comfortable and the material is so soft.,pos
"I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss. first off, it's about 3 sizes too big. second off, it's knitted with a metallic thread that you can't really notice in the picture. i'm usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient.",neg
"This romper fit like a dream!  it is gorgeous, unique, and sexy. i am rating this 2 stars because it took me 20 minutes to try it on!  there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top. nobody's got time for that!!!!  i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friend's 40th birthday party. but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off. no thank you!  i considered buying the romp",neg
"I typically wear a small or x-small in most brands from retailer, but decided to order a small and medium in this dress since it's a non-stretchy fabric. i'm glad i did because the medium was a good fit and the small would have been very snug. so i would agree with the previous reviewer and say that this dress runs at least a size small. otherwise i really like the fit the fabric.",pos
This is an adorable top. i purchased both the green and the blue. the colors and look are so much nicer than the photos of it. this is a stock up item.,pos
"I adore this skirt - it is so soft and flowy. i was not sure if the mesh would be a bit stiff, but it's not at all. the dots are soft as is the main fabric. i could wear this all day long and be very comfy. the underlying fabric is a bit more taupe than gold in color. i am between sizes to i sized up and was glad i did- no pinch at the waist. i love that it's feminine yet funky and could be worn formally or in fun. it is midi-length, as you see on the model. absolutely a great buy!",pos
Great swim top. good coverage and very comfortable. be advised this is not reversible like title suggests.,pos
Absolutely amazing! a must staple in every one's closet this season. i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed look/feel. the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on,pos
"Got this in the black when i was in greenville nc. i had seen it online for a little while and didn't think much of it until i tried it on in the store. it's surprisingly comfortable and it isn't too heavy. its the perfect ""staple"" black shirt in my closet. it is also very forgiving.",pos
"Loved this online, but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky.",neg
"I tried on te regualr size (xs) as that is all they have in my store, and decided to get them anyway, even if a little long on me. why? because htey are so cute rolled up with the yellow color showing!

super comfortable, have not washed htem yet, but hipefully they remain a decent wuality.",pos
"I'm 5'3"" 115 lbs and ordered an xs petite. i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well, but this one was weirdly big at the top",neg
"I bought these about a month ago in the sky blue - gorgeous color! i was a little disappointed because they fit bigger than i normally wear my pants, but i decided to keep them anyway. they are the most comfortable pants i've ever worn - butter soft. i have dressed them up with a nice top and suede booties, and also worn casual with a baggy sweater and toms. i highly recommend these pants!",pos
"Very cute, very flattering. the peplum is fairly subtle and really works, falling at just the right place for me (i'm 5'5). i got the red and have worn it over a dress and with jeans. the color is deep and works well with my pale skin. the fabric is quality and looks like it will hold up well over time - always an issue with sweaters.

unlike some of the other reviewers, i found it ran slightly large. i am small framed but large-chested and often take a medium in sweaters, but a small is roomy o",pos
"Very comfortable and super cute. the top sold out, which i'm bummed about, but matched it with a funky black top.",pos
I cannot say enough about these chinos. i hope retailer will keep them around for a long time despite the news that says retailer is going the way of jcrew. these pants are more stylish and comfortable than any other chinos i have owned. i am a teacher and being comfortable and stylish at the same time is important. i am a 10 to 12 and a 30 fits me fine. please please retailer keep making these every season in fun colors!!!,pos
"Love this! i am 5' 118 and the medium fits like a dress, not a tunic. i opted for the medium because i didn't want the fit to be tight. it is thin so you'll need a slip.",pos
"So versatile
i tried this on in my usual regular 0, but it was way too long at the shoulders, large in the bust(i am 32b), and a tad too long overall. i ordered the 0p and it fits perfectly! can wear this year round and looks great with or without a belt. pockets would have made it even better, but still love it.",pos
"I don't know how to explain, but this dress at least for me did not look like the model, first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts, for me it didn't start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking... so definitely not for my type of body, i am normal height (5'5'', athletic and curvy body) but maybe for a very tall person looks good! the material is very interesting, it's so soft!",neg
"This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.",pos
I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece. lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections. wish it came in more colors!,pos
Was enchanted by this dress from the moment i saw it online. i was able to find it at my local retailer,pos
"I waited to review as i ordered both colors and multiple sizes for comparison.

ivory is actually truly longer than the black, i wasn't sure from the photos on line, but having tried both on, ivory is longer (as shown online).

true to size/bigger: i am never sure if i should write true to size or big, but went with the xs petite (used to do everything in xs)... at 115 lbs, 30 dd chest, 26.5 in waist,t ehre was room to move super comfortably. petite for sure for me for both length at the kne",pos
This dress is to die for.  the picture doesn't do it justice. so pretty and dainty.  perfect dress for a wedding.,pos

"I love this dress. i typically do not like or wear dresses often, and definitely not this style. i'm glad i tried something different. i received numerous compliments on how flattering and attractive it is. yes the belt is only in the front, but i cinched it very tight and it pulled the back in. i bought size s. it was very form fitting in the top and waist, and not too big through the hips. i have a 38"" bust and i can button all the top without pulling. i wore it with black tights and high brow",pos
"I've been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi, feels like a perfect summer staple...but sadly this was not it. quality isn't great which is surprise on a $168 price tag. top of dress is lined but cheaply so it's somewhat see through. the dress was returned.",neg
"I loved this dress. i am 5 ft tall and usually wear xs. this dress i would definitely need an xxs in. i like things not too tight, but this was too roomy so the style was lost. it was a little long, but i think that is because it kind of hung on me. the material is light but substantial. it has a lot of stretch to it, which is very nice. it has a silky feel - could be worn dressy or every day. a very good dress all around. waiting for the xxs to come in - i would definitely recommend it.",pos
"I ordered the xl and it fits me the same as pictured on the model so it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. i love the mix of colors, especially for fall. i've always had great luck with the fit & wear of this brand. i'd love to see this same style done in lighter colors for summer.",pos
"This sweater is a great, oversized, warm, and very soft cozy winter treasure. it is very comfortable to wear, and looks cute on. i really believe it would be flattering on almost anyone. i highly recommend it, especially now that it is on sale.",pos
"I am pleased with this modal cowl neck top; it is a very basic but is a nice addition to my wardrobe. the cowl is just right-not overly 'chunky' or awkward; it drapes nicely and lies flat against my chest. this blouse 'softens' the face-just what i was looking for-i needed a soft-looking black tee to go with a skirt i have and wanted a bit 'more' than a basic tee but nothing overly frilly or ruffled. this blouse filled the bill quite nicely. it is a very soft modal fabric and fits tts. i am 5'5""",pos
I just wore these and they were comfortable and didn't stretch our or become baggy throughout the day. i have three kids and am constantly moving. they're a nice in between weight and held up nicely. i have some from j.crew that stretch out and become baggy in the knees and backside and these didn't do that. i usually wear an 8/10 and i purchased a medium and they fit well. i would say that run a little big though.,pos
"I wasn't looking for a little black dress but i couldn't resist this one. it's as stunning in person as it is in the pictures online. the front has a corset-like closure which i didn't realize until it arrived. it's very classy though, not cheap looking. the lace detail is really beautiful. i was a bit concerned about how the sheer looking areas would look because i was hoping to wear the dress for a dressy work function. it's definitely a sexy dress but the fact that there's so much coverage ma",pos
"I really wanted to like this top. in person though, the fit was too large and boxy. i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike. i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting. the material was nice and lightweight. perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust.",neg
"I generally love pilcro pants and these are no exception. the fabric is heavy but soft, the color is so vivid but still easy to mix with other top combinations. they are comfortable and flattering. i am 5'2"" and these are not crops on me, with the rolled up hem they are a perfect full length pant but that works well for me.",pos

"I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big. unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back. i love the lyocell material, i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesn't look right. it is not as pictured as well. the skirt i received is a medium blue denim, not the lovely light blue as pictured, another reason why i am returning.",neg
"I just received the pink in the mail. i am 5' 5"" and around 140. i ordered the size 29, they fit perfectly. they are a very straight leg with a snug fit. you can adjust the cuff to whatever length you need or unroll them completely. the fabric is of beautiful quality. i basically never wear corduroy because it can add pounds. not so with this pair of pants. i am thinking about another color!!",pos

"So let me start by saying i love non-skinny cut jeans. i'm a curvy athletic type with thick legs, so when a jeans comes around with a ""generous"" fit, i'm thrilled! these jeans are generously cut through the hips and waist, giving it a boyfriend type of cut. the denim is soft, like your old favorite pair of jeans that have been washed 1000 times. i did size down one size and probably could have gone down one more size, but i still want a bit of a looser cut. pilcro denim always has stretch in the",pos
This is the most fabulous sweater ever. i really hesitated spending $368 for a sweater but this sweater is worth every dime! it is soft and luxurious. i tried it over a cashmere cable knit dress and it looks unbelievable -- i also tried it over jeans and it looks equally as good. if it came in another color - i'd buy it too.,pos
Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.,pos
This dress was really odd. i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that's about it. the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large. i was just very underwhelmed with this dress. also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution. overall its okay just hated it on me.,neg
I love this top. i also have it in blue! i wish it came in more colors/ prints! i would definitely buy it!,pos
"This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering, but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all, it's just a very good design. 
note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear, without being visible, into the sleeve when they are not being used. also, the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used, so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).",pos
"I'm very pleased with my purchase of this dress. it is perfect for dancing or a spring/summer wedding or doing out. it is very flattering on my rather straight/slender/petite frame. i ordered a size 4 and it was tts. if it only had pockets, it would be absolutely perfect!",pos

"After multiple purchase and returns (from other sites!) i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation (located beach side). this dress was better than i could have hoped. the fit is very flattering, loose & tight in all the right places. the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather. the slight train & back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise ""casual"" floral pattern. i would highly recommend",pos
"This is an adorable top. sweet back detail, thin material but soft. the top is two sizes too big, i'm normally a large and a small fits. i know it is supposed to be baggy but the large was inches too big under each arm. size down and petite ladies will be sized out. love this though.",pos

"I love this tee. it has a very flattering fit and the fabric is very soft. it runs small, especially in the arms. i suggest sizing up. the tee looks great on. it is slimming and super comfortable.",pos
"I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy, but this is huge.  i wear a l or xl at retailer, and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top.  sadly, this will be going back.",neg
"This blouse is a great combination of silky and professional in the front and more casual, t-shirt like in the back. the ruffle lies nicely, and it's very feminine. i got the light blue color, and can't wait for the weather to be warm enough to wear this to work!",pos
This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.,pos
I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.,neg
"As soon as i saw this dress online, i knew i wanted it!  i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders.  i ordered online, and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress.  i am 5'5 and it hits just an inch above my knee.  it's the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!",pos
"I'm 60+, in relatively decent shape, 135 lbs, and size 6 is perfect. i went for the regular rather than petite sizing, which came well below my knees, and although i would usually have a sheath dress like this hemmed up to that slim part right at the bottom of the knee, the slim silhouette shape served to lengthen the profile as a longer dress, so i left it about 3"" below the knee. the stretch allows it to hug the body, and with the right undergarments, it is super comfortable and attractive. go",pos
"Love these bottoms, cheekier than i thought but like them even more!",pos
I love this tee! i bought the teal in store. rich colors. little details are perfect. the loose got was very flattering on me. i'm not busty at all and it hung so well. wore it to brunch and the flight home later!,pos
"When i'm looking for something comfortable to wear that looks effortless and cool, this is the top i pick! i ended up buying it in navy too. it's really soft, ur washes well, and it's great quality! a must have.",pos
"I ordered the red in xl and the fit on me matches the photos on the model. it's true to size. the quality of the material is fantastic. the stitched upper portion is well-done. the color is much prettier in person. it's such a bright, cheerful, well-made top. i washed mine and air dried it. fits & looks great after washing. this is a bargain, especially on sale. the red combo is such a unique mix of colors. i like using blue jewelry with it. but, also mint green jewelry too.",pos
There isn't anything i don't love about this dress! get it before it's gone! i get compliments every time i wear this dress.,pos
I saw this dress in the lilac at the store and loved it immediately! the picture on the website does not do it justice.,pos
Great shirt.  love the detail in back.  feminine and different than the average t,pos
"Could not wait to try this on when it arrived, jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here, i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'5 and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute, while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!",pos
"I got a small mauve. the fit is great and the length is perfect for me, just few inches above my knees.
cute and cozy! what more can i aske for!?",pos
Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave,pos
One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.,neg
"I love these bottoms. great colors. i also love the feel of the bottoms, very soft. high quality.",pos
"I absolutely adore this cardigan. it's very feminine, stylish, and comfortable and the gold color is gorgeous. i received numerous compliments when i wore it to work the first time. it's the perfect weight for transitional weather or chilly offices.",pos
"I did the happy dance when the dress arrived, but the very sad dance when i tried it on. unfortunately, instead of following my instincts, i took the review here (and reviews from some other sites) to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual . huge mistake, as in this dress was huge -- much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design. for reference i'm 5'7, 130lbs, 34c. i usually wear an 8 dress (due to a very large rib cage). i ordered the 10 but was literally swimming. i think a 6 woul",pos

"Had been eyeing this for a while. print is beautiful in person, just as pictured. tts fit (size 8, 5'7"", 150#, pear shaped). comes within a couple inches of my knees so long enough to wear to work.",pos
"I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist, but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one, the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses, but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou",pos
"Love this! ordered it on sale, but i really do think it's worth full price! i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good too...i'm slender and 5'9"" about 125# with full bust. the small fits similar to the model, and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves (i have long arms!) and length, i went with the small. maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy! it's very well made and although you'll need a cami, i still feel as if it will be very cozy. perfect for our mi",pos
I sized down to an xs based on reviews and the fit was perfect. i am 34 b and usually take a small. i like the classic lines with the sexy edge. this is a heavier sweater but perfect for our houston fall and winter. if you size down the sweater has a much nicer fit to it and is not at all loose fitting. it just skims your curves.,pos
"Finally a jumper that works for me! i am 5'6 but i have a long torso so most jumpers ride up in an uncomfortable way. this one is perfect. the material is light and perfect for warm weather. the top is very adjustable for all different chest sizes. i personally think the pant length looks better if you are under 5'8"" because it comes down closer to the ankle but then again if you have long thin legs you might not mind the bottom hitting at your calf. i can't say enough good things about this jum",pos
"They fit me great, are super comfortable. they are casual, yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs. they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions. i love them with booties :). i think they look better in person than online, too",pos
"This t is so pretty in person. the gold is metallic with embroidered detail. this is my first purchase of this brand, so my usual size medium fit just fine. i am excited to put this under one of my blazers for a casula friday. it is quite unusual and great quality.",pos
"This dress looks beautiful on. it's very flattering and comfortable to wear. it runs true to maeve's dress sizing which for me means in these dresses i always get one size larger than what i normally wear. on my 5'3"" height the regular was just above the knee. great for giving you the illusion of the figure you want even if you don't have it naturally !",pos
"Pilcro has my heart! their cut and style are perfect for me - no more squeezing into skinny jeans! dear retailer, please always sell pilcro and maeve brands - they are amazing!",pos
"I am in love with these. bought the regular length last year and loved them despite the shortness (hit right above the ankle). that length looks good with ballet flats or tucked into boots. this year i bought the burgundy and the teal in the long length. i am 5'7"" and the long fit perfectly! they come to the bottom of my ankle without extra fabric. 
please restock the ""carbon"" in the long length! i want to buy my 4th pair!",pos
"This is a terrific top!  the supima cotton is super-soft; the black, a deep black.  i love that antho is listening, and that it's made in the usa!  the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering.  i bought the medium and am a reliable size 8 top/medium, 34f.  the sleeves are nice and long.  don't miss out on this classic tee, friends!",pos
"But it runs super small. i wear a medium for everything but couldn't come close to buttoning this. the buttons were about 4 inches apart (horizontally)

probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit. the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires ""truth in sizing""",neg
"Love, love, love this top. so flattering and forgiving. bought it in white - great for summer!",pos
"Beautiful dress and so delicately well made!
5'1"" 95lb - xxs petite or the smallest size possible worked for me
it accentuates one's curvy body and covers up any excess skin in the belly area. i could eat on freely at a formal occasion. words just cannot describe how beautiful this dress is.",pos
"Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg, have plenty of length (i'm 5'6, and there is a good inch of extra length), but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though, but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey, probably a size 31 in jeans right now, and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality",pos
I absolutely love these pants. they are so incredibly comfortable and fit is amazing! they look awesome with sandals and boots and will transition perfectly into fall. i definitely recommend sizing down like the other reviewers have suggested. i originally purchased my normal size 27 but they were loose after wearing a little around the house. i decided to exchange them for a 26 and they were a little snug at first but stretched out and fit perfect!,pos
This dress is so cute and comfy! i purchased it for my friend's wedding brunch celebration - perfect transitional piece!,pos
Love this print and fabric! its soft and comfy with adjustable straps. so pretty and feminine!,pos
"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.

i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.

both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.

this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes",neg
I love this! the contrast in much prettier in person.,pos
"This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.

a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.",neg
"Great turtleneck, very comfortable and not tight around the neck at all. the material is super soft and washes well. i ended up getting all 3 colors. my only regret is that there are only 3 colors! i absolutely love this top. i also like the many complements i've received while wearing them. i am full figured and the fit is very flattering.",pos
"A lovely sweatshirt with mesh front and back cover with soucotache (sp?) handwork, with a touch of sequins for some pop! the knit sleeves are thin, but the top has some weight due to the detailing on the front and back.

the fit is tts and as shown on the model. it lays comfortable but it's not really baggy.

really lovely. glad i bought one before it was sold out.",pos
"This top is extremely well done. it looks classy and timeless. i tried on the white version in store, but chose to order the black as the white was too sheer.",pos
"I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email, and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself. i was very excited to get it, as it is a beautiful coat online. however, once i received it i was very disappointed. the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost $168, and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with. i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well.

This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year's eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!,pos
"Very flattering, not too short, beautiful. i'm 5.6, 36d, usually wear m in dresses, wide hips. the 8 fit very nicely.",pos
"This shirt is everything i wanted it to be! lightweight, easy style without being shapeless. it is sheer, but perfect with a tank underneath. i'm an extra small, and it fit perfectly - not tight, not too loose...honestly, if it came in more colors i'd buy it in every one. definitely going to be a fall staple!",pos
"I love pairing this skirt with edgy tops, it plays so well with the detailing! i'm usually a size 8 but sized up to a 10 so that it didn't pull, other than that,  absolutely love it! beautiful all over",pos
Love this dress! the material has a softness to it - just love it! can't wait to wear it this summer. fits true to size.,pos
"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me.",pos
I loved these and wore them once (i bought the red ones) and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye- ruined yet another chair!!! so annoyed. i loved them but they are not worth it.,neg
"I ordered this on sale in blue as i had missed it online. i wore it this week during our heat spurt in cali and was shocked how incredible comfy and cute this was with my skinny jeans. it was perfect for the warm day, as well as the snapping evening meeting i had to attend on an outdoor patio... i will love wearing this from spring into summer. i do hope they bring it back as i would love the beige too!.",pos
I love this cozy and comfy top. it is oversized as the name says and implies - but i normally wear an xs in most retailer tops and i chose to get a small - and i'm glad i did. it is boxy and oversized - but also short. the small is perfect for me and it really feels so cozy as is - and big enough to wear a tee or tank under it and not fee clingy.,pos
"Love these jeans! they fit great, they feel great. i am 5'9.5 135 pounds. they fit everywhere you would like them to. unroll them and they are long! love love love!! so wonderful i just bought my second pair.",pos
"I just purchased this adorable, unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it. as soon as i saw it, i knew i had to have it! it is super soft, tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever. the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are what's really so sweet on this one. though i'm not a fan of snails in my garden, i'll make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea",pos
"Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering, with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person, the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute, i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself.",pos
"I ordered this in black and loved it so much, i ordered the 'red' color too. it hasn't arrived yet, but i'm hoping its tan like it appears to be online. it fits tts (5'3"" and 110lbs) - the xs fit perfectly and wasn't too long.",pos
A cute top. slightly tight in the upper area. debated returning but decided to keep as the top is unique and i know that i will wear it frequently. aleardy thinking of way to wear all year around! runs small,pos
"Do not buy these pants!  the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots, and i followed the washing instructions.  i bought another pair and the same thing happened.  i'm out a bunch of money!",neg
I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.,pos
"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette, but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands, and the size 0 fit me well.",pos
I ordered the yellow/floral version in size xl. it fits me just as shown with the model so it's true to size. it's very comfortable and made well. the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too.,pos
"I'm 5'9 and 150 pounds and got a medium. the cut is very flattering on me and i have received many compliments when i wear it. it is lined, so no need to wear a cami underneath.",pos
Bought the gray and peach in the store and loved it so much ordered the other colors online. this top is very comfortable and stylish. it stands out from the crowd as just enough different to be very unique and trendy but still a classic look. the sweater front is very soft and the back has a bit of a silk feel but not sheer. i also like that the back is a bit longer than the front.,pos
"I bought the black one on an extra 40% off sale and i just love it! not thrilled about the other colors, but i might order another one just because i like it so much. super soft and comfy. i had to order a size up since the mediums were all sold out, but i like the way it fits. not too big at all.",pos
"Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette.",pos
"I walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on. i am so glad she did. this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets! after assessing it further, i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down. i bought a small, i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist. i am 5ft 3"" 137 lbs 36b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure. for",pos
"Love these pants - they are a perfect color, are of a good weight (i sometimes worry that light-colored pants are going to be see through), and fit wonderfully. they are true to size and are narrow down the leg - perfect for flats, boots, booties, or sandals for summer!",pos
"I was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line. i fell in love immediately and didn't think twice about paying full price. i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good. the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green, which gives it extra character. very well made. i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings, but they are very secure. 

i ordered my usual xl and found it roomy enough in the bust and arms. i would definitely call it tru",pos
"I'm petite, but even if i weren't, i think this runs very large, isn't form flattering at all, and overall looks dull. it most definitely does not justify the price. material is thin.",neg
This shirt was very cute. i ordered it as something to be able to wear to class with leggings and it is perfect. the colors are great and the length is very nice. it will be a nice piece to layer with a jacket for the the fall.,pos
"I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasn't going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.
it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10, as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room.",pos
I ordered the size xl and it fits me as it does on the model. it's true to size. it is made of a scratchier material but is still comfortable to wear. definitely needs a tank/cami underneath. i love the vintage look. it's worn well & washed well too. i'd love to see more versions in this same style. i'll get good use out of this in the summer and then will layer cardigans over it in the fall.,pos
"These jeans! i am obsessed. the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy, relaxed feel. i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these. do yourself a favor and buy them!!",pos
"I pretty much love any sweater by moth. this one is no exception. soft, lofty, and a pretty shade (i bought in pink), this will be a cold weather staple.",pos
"Love these jeans, comfortable fit and material is soft.. fit true to size and have a good rise.",pos
"This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup, and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now, at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band, and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure, but it fits perfectly there for me.",pos
"I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design, this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.",neg
I purchased this for my 20-something daughter. it is so complimentary and cute and stylish!,pos
"I cannot begin to tell you how much i love these jeans. i have been searching everywhere for the right pair of black jeans, and this is it. they run a little small and don't have as much give as regular pilcro jeans: i am normally a 28 in pilcro and i purchased these in a 29. the fit is wonderful and they keep their shape beautifully.",pos
"Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans, pencil skirts and capris .",pos
Very versatile dress.  runs a bit large i am 5 foot 2 (105 lbs) and ordered the xs petite and it fit perfectly!,pos
"I love how the white and beige were not see through and actually very forgiving to people with cellulite. love love the fit. highly recommend. i'm always a 30 but in these i even fit into the 29. i would say if you're in between, size down. i love the fit so much that i got the beige and white. highly recommend. hit at my ankle for me at 5'6",pos

"In love with this dress! so feminine and lovely. makes you feel beautiful. the fabric, flow, and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering. i am 5ft2in and 114 lbs...bought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area.  however, the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me. cannot wait to wear this dress, but it is so long &needs to be altered. itll be worth it!",pos
"I just got it in the mail and i love it! very versatile piece. wear with skinny jeans and heels or tucked into a skirt. i usually wear a size small but went with what the other review said about a small being tailored and got the medium so i could tuck the front into jeans. i am 5'5"" ,125lbs , a 32dd and wear a size 4 or 27 in jeans.",pos
"I love this top! i actually didn't read the reviews prior and ordered a small. the retailer tag on mine says small, but the tag in the shirt is xs. it does run large, so the mix-up was fine by me. the style of the shirt is meant to be loose and light. i love it.",pos
"I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my ""wheelhouse"" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't ""pull it off,"" but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7"" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took",pos

"I bought the sweater in nude, and it fits perfectly. it is so much better than a standard cardigan- it has beautiful details. its drapes so well across your body, and it longer in the front than the back which makes it hang beautifully. i wear this to work, but would definitely wear this on the weekends for more casual outfits- its very versatile.",pos
"The fabric is incredibly soft and has a good weight to it. this is also pretty warm. it's not a down jacket, but it's as least as warm as a sweatshirt. it fits close to the body in typical bomber jacket fashion. i'm 5'6 155 lbs and went with the large, which fits well. i always find myself wishing bomber jackets were just a tad longer and this is no exception, but i can't really fault the jacket for that, it's true to the style.",pos
I love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.,pos
"These are my first pair of mother denim and certainly not the last. they fit true to size. i am a 26 in designer denim such as j brand, paige, ag. i bought these in a size 26 and they fit perfectly. they hug my curves nicely. i am 5'3 so they bunch up just a little bit at the ankles which i can easily have altered, but honestly don't need it. the quality is great - nice denim material with a lot of stretch to it. i love my skinny jeans tight and these were exactly what i was looking for!",pos
"I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger. but it's basically cut for model-sized people only. it's short and wide, and if you have any boobs at all it'll make the back pucker. i can't imagine this will look good on most women.",neg
"I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.
problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).
problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other",neg
"This jacket is phenomenal. the color is gorgeous in person. the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special. it's also very warm and comfortable. like some other reviewers said, it looked great zipped as well as unzipped. this is a really special find and great addition! if you're considering this jacket i say go for it. for reference, i actually love the fit and thought it was tts, though i am a 32c and got this in a small so perhaps that's only the case for c cup a",pos
Far more attractive in person than online. earlier reviews are all accurate. very flattering and quality manufacturing. the scarf bow makes it so distinctive.,pos
"This is such a cute vest. nice and cozy. so cute paired with a long sleeve tee, statement necklace, jeans and booties. very happy with my purchase!",pos
"Impecable workmanship (overseas). i usually wear a petite 2 but ordered this in a regular size 0 and glad that i did. since it curves up on this side, it barely overs the waistband on my jeans. ordered this in pink but it's more of pale coral pink. the style is more of a semi-halter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra. it's a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather.",pos
"I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less), i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos, the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered, i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs",neg
"These are the softest jeans ever! i love the way that they hold their shape, and make my bum look amazing!! i am 5'3"" and they do come much longer than shown on the model...right below my ankle bone. i actually prefer this because they will be wearable right through fall if i pair them with booties! the fit is true to size...108 pounds and i got a 25. highly recommend!!",pos
"Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one, so i ordered down. it can go either way, it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.",pos
"I didn't notice what some of the other reviews have said. i think it's very flattering, makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun. it is low cut in the bust, but not crazy. i'm a modest person and i'm comfortable with it. what i like best however it the cut of the top. it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge! the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun. it does run a tad large. i can go between a 2 and 4 in most retailer dresses and got",pos
"I absolutely love this dress. it is very body conscious, but has some ""give"" to it. the sleeves and lines are beautiful. very well constructed... sexy without being overtly so. i find it very elegant",pos
This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!,pos
Really wanted to love...but...the way it fit..lower part a tad too flowy...almost maternity like to hide a belly and the top area feels like my chest is being smushed! despite my bra size being a modest 36b...the look it gave was square on top almost block like with bottom that had flare...such a pretty top unfortunately the overall design just didn't work me.,neg
Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.,neg
Bought this dress to wear to work. love it! great buy,pos
"I love these jeans. they're incredibly soft, super comfortable and hold their shape. i can wear them for hours on end and i don't get that droopy, snagging look jeans can get when they stretch out. 
 

fit: i am normally a 29/30 depending on the jean. i took these in the 30 - i usually have a difficult time finding skinny jeans that fit my legs and don't fall off my waist. these have enough give to accommodate my larger legs, but the material holds well, so i don't need a belt to keep them up",pos
"This is a pretty dress. like the positive reviews have noted.
very figure flattering",pos
Cute sweater! the side panels are perforated so you may want to wear either a nude bra or a cami underneath..,pos
This shirt is not near as nice as it may look the fabric is just ok it runs large i ordered a xs and the neck line was huge and gaping not worth the money even on sale,neg
"If you are curvy, this dress is for you. every details is flattering, from the seams to the fit-and-flare cut. true to size. this dress will easily cross seasons. love it!",pos
"This cardigan is very cute and versatile. the knit is medium weight and will work well for moderate weather. i would say that the sizing is pretty true to size, but maybe runs just a bit large. thus, if you are in between sizes, order the smaller size.",pos
I love the style and the flow of this shirt. definitely worth the purchase and very flattering!,pos
"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!",pos
"This sweater is gorgeous, i wish i could have purchased in several colors because it's now a staple in my closet. downside- it does say delicate cold water wash, but the lace on the back is so delicate and pulling happens on the sides every time i wear it, so dry cleaning is the way to go. the sweater does snag easily, so don't wear anything that could get caught in it (jewelry/handbags with chains or embellishments) because they will catch.",pos
"I love this to throw over leggings, covers your butt. great fabric and quality. i bought white and gray, after they arrived i knew i needed a black one, but, sadly, it doesn't come in black :(
i ordered xs, and it's roomy. size down for sure.",pos
"I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well, maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2"" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or 2 but i purchased in a size 4 and it fits perfectly! can't wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!",pos
"Despite being batwing and sort of poncho-like, this sweater is quite flattering on. hangs just right. unique cut and soft fabric.",pos
"I loved this the minute i saw it in the store but left without buying it.  i called the store an hour later and asked them to hold it for me so i could get it the next day. :)

i love it.  it's still a little too warm to wear it in nyc yet but i will soon. i'm thinking 40-50's is the perfect temps for it.  

i rarely say this but i don't think the photos of the coat above do it justice.",pos
"This jumpsuit is a classic!!!!! i read the reviews where some were complaining about the buttons i did not have these issues (maybe because i have short fingernails). i like this jumpsuit because the style of it will be around for a long time. you can dress the jumpsuit up or down. i rarely pay full price but this jumpsuit is so great/fantastic, that i did not mind doing so. i strongly recommend this jumpsuit.",pos
"Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).
my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees.",pos
"These jeans are awesome, as most of the reviewers have already noted, they are tastefully aged to look modern but not so ripped that i look sloppy. they fit true to size with retailer's recent sizing. i used to wear a size 26, but in the last couple of years i have had to move down to a size 25 even though i am still the same size and weight??? anyway, i bought these in a size 25 and they are perfect! i have not worn them all day yet so i cannot comment on whether they stretch out after wea",pos
"I love this coat! i purchased the size 6. i am a size 6 petite, but they were out. plus i wanted the coat to be a little longer. i wasn't a fan of how high it was on the model. it fit as i expected. i will have to take up the arm length, and it hit a little longer than it did on the model. i am 5' 120 pounds. 34c

"I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i",pos
I love this with skinny jeans! it is comfortable and soft. it fits well.,pos
"I thought this was adorable on the model, but not so much on me. i actually didn't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan, but i didn't want to keep it for 1 look. the material felt inexpensive. the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself. i'm 5'8"" and about 160 lbs.",neg
"This sweater is super cute. it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants. love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold, mint/teal and grey/dark gray.",pos
"Classic retailer stunning dress! the embroidery is beautiful, with the beads and details. the blush color can be difficult with my pale complexion, but i didn't have trouble with this. i got a ton of compliments. it looks a bit flat on top on the model. i'm not very curvy, and it accentuates my curves nicely. it doesn't hang down quite so much as it looks in the picture, but has a more classic fit and flare shape, very flattering.",pos
"I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand. they are lightweight, sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body. this brand can run big, so i usually buy a size 2 rather than my normal size 4. i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first, but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes: 26 and 27 because they didn't label them 2, 4, 6 etc. anymore. these pants still look well made and have cute little details, but they are bigger than ever!! the 27's",neg
"When i saw this in store i was so attracted to the colors on the v neck and actually thought it was a dress! until i tried it on i was confused about the very high side slits.... then i figured it was a tunic. i've always hated/avoided tunics because i thought they would widen my thighs and give me a bad shape. they actually made me look straighter/slimmer which looked amazing! the more i had it on, the more i fell in love with it and didn't want to take it off! i can wear it in the winter and f",pos
"Oh my!! this dress is so cute! it fits me exactly like the pictures. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and ordered a medium. i maybe could have worn a small as well though. there is a lot of fabric to this dress, so if you're under 5'6"", it might overwhelm you! i'm 5'6"" and the medium was barely sleepy the floor in a low heel! this is s dress you can dress up or down. i also appreciated the neckline not being too revealing. and pockets!! that was a nice surprise! the fabric is a little thicker, so it's no",pos
This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!,pos
I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!,neg
"This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white, needless to say it went back.",neg
"This blouse is made out of a high-quality material, flows beautifully, and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference, size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.",pos
"This shirt was a cute print, but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh. i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasn't worth paying the extra $ on top of the $88",neg
"If i had to describe on two words, that would be it. the material is not a stiff no-give material, nbut rahter a soft stretchy material, with some depth (the design has ""grooves"", not sure how to explain it#. if you are short, i would definitely go with petite though, it was a little too long on regular size and hit in the ""wrong"" spot on my calves. very flattering, and nice cut. i dind't order yet as it is new and i jsut bought a few dresses... but in my basket forh te next ""sale"" :) #if they s",pos
This dress is so much better in person than pictures. details on the sleeves and buttons on the front shows quality and makes it an original looking dress. i've wore it yesterday for the first time and received 4 compliments. buy before it sells out!,pos

"Adorable skirt! thought it would be snug so ordered up, but had to send back and re-order in normal size. fits perfect. found it to be slimming on the backside, yay! :) this will be a wardrobe staple for many years to come!",pos
"The skirt is just okay. the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through. there is a slip which goes to mid-thigh- very strange and felt weird as well. the pleats are okay but not great. overall, it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that. and again, be wary of it being see through.",neg
"I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.",pos
Such a cute skirt. it has a touch of whimsy with this tropical flare that makes me feel pretty. it fits well and it is true to size.,pos
"Spied this dress in my local retailer and figured i would try it on for overall fit before ordering the petite on line. for some reason retailer has eliminated in-store petite items (so disappointing). i was pleasantly surprised the xs regular fit well and was soon in my checkout pile. the dress is very soft although i suspect it will wrinkle when packed in a suitcase. the color blocking is great and makes this dress so versatile for spring, summer and fall. the xs regular fit my 5'1"" 115 lb",pos
"Very much in love with this ethereal, delicate dress. the silk is very light and slightly clingy, so take caution when wearing. the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with. the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite. those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down, otherwise tts. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#",pos
"I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mother's day weekend insta posts by retailer stores. i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me, as it's pretty straight up and down, and i wasn't sure the waist would hit at the right place, because i'm super high waisted and this didn't appear to be so. in truth, it isn't, and i'll be tying the ribbon (or wearing a slim belt) at a higher point than where was originally intended. however, what struck me was the ability",pos
"Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily, i found a review on another site, stating that these run small, before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also, i'm 5'8"" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller, you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top, because i'm not sure of the fit, but i'm guessing it also runs small, based on the photo.",pos
"After a long wait for this dress to come in. i finally received it! the wait was worth it!

the colors and pattern are just like they are online. the length comes right to to the top of my knees...i am 5'7"". a couple of things to note: the sleeves are narrow,. if you have skinny arms, no problem. the fit across the bust is snug enough that if you have a large bust, there will probably be a gap at the buttons. there are gathers at the shoulder giving the sleeve a slight puffed shoulder. if you",pos
There's a stretch and a swing to the dress that makes you feel light and free. really sexy as pictured with boots and scarf,pos
"This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!",pos
"Cute design, the fabric drapes well, conceals many possible figure flaws, and has an upbeat, easy vibe. i got a small and am 125 lbs and 5'4"". i also washed it on a short cycle on cold and put it in the dryer for 5 minutes, which worked out just fine. great dress!",pos
"These pants are amazing! i love that they zip in the back and the material is just right. i am 5'7"" and they are the perfect length. i bought the black and now buying the gray. i hope they come out with more colors!!!",pos
Beautiful detail. fits likes a glove. i have a short torso and design hits perfectly on my waist. may not be good for those with longer torsos. very flattering . arm holes well fitted. no open gaps. i plan to wear this to a november wedding.,pos
"Even though this shirt is incredibly thin, i love that i can wear it multiple ways throughout the year. it can be used as a swimsuit coverup, with white jeans in the summer, over skinny jeans and with a sweater in the fall/winter. this is a great piece to own!",pos
"I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me, and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!",neg
"Wow. bailey 44 knocks it out of the park with this sensual, i-am-woman-hear-me-purr body-slimming dress. we all have our hang ups. this dress forces you to see all the beauty that everyone else sees. the rouching covers up any dimpling or rolls you think you have. the body conscious structure lets you see those curves you knew existed but deny yourself from loving. oh - you hate your arms? me too! guess what - you don't even notice them because you're so focused on how amazing you look. the cut",pos
"I love how soft and cozy this sweater is. the addition of some cashmere in the yarn makes all the difference. the red color is beautiful also, perfect for the holidays. flattering cut in the back (it dips down to cover your bum) and the pointelle details are very pretty. fit was tts",pos
This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!,pos
So comfortable-so versatile-so perfect,pos
"Despite retailer's claim that they have ""fixed"" the button issue on this coat, beware. they haven't. i ordered this coat november 18th, feeling safe that the issue that scores of other reviewers had noted was fixed, because retailer indicated ""rest assured, this issue has been fixed"" (as noted in the item description). feeling confident that i'd get a non-defective coat at this late date in the quality assurance cycle, i was severely disappointed to open my shipment tonight (nov 24th) immediately di",neg

Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible,pos
"I love this off the shoulder top. it is so flattering  and the  colors are gorgeous. i normally wear a small or medium in retailer tops, i am wearing an extra small in this one, and it fits great. i am only 5 1"" tall so the length hits me perfectly.",pos
"Great color, soft fabric, but waaaaay too long. more like a night shirt than a t-shirt.",neg
"Love this tank!! the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow. i've worn this to yoga, and to teach barre and cardio dance and it's a hit! as a life-long dancer, this was a must have. my only negative is since the sizing is either xs/s or m/l, it may run too big or too small for some. i tyically wear a m or 6 in retailer tops and this is a little large in m/l; however, not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like. highly recommend.",pos
"This skirt looks cute online but, it has several issues. 1.) the slit is very high, this photo is deceptive, look closely...the slit is actually to her finger tips. you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights. 2.) slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away. 3.) the micro mini ""slip"" bunches. 4.) the fine knit is very snag-able. 5.) the skirt is very long. it is going back.",neg
"I bought this dress at my local retailer store on friday and love it! the dress is well made, with some heft to the yarn. the colors of the yarn, blue, white and grey, seem to shimmer a bit due to their weave, but there is no metallic thread in the dress that i can tell. i know some have written that the dress is a sack, but not on me. i toyed with buying this online and then didn't due to the negative comments about the dress; i bought an extra small and it fits well (i usually where an x small,",pos

Doesn't feel like cotton jersey. feels like a thin version of the seamless cami. it's not soft as i expected. it's much thinner than expected too.,neg
Beautiful dress that is easy to just throw on and go. i bought both colors. though it is loose it is still flattering. it has a good length and movement. i'm normally a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium as it is pretty loose fit.,pos
"I saw this sweater and just about died. i loved the accentuated shoulders and beautiful knit detail on the sleeves. lucky for me, retailer day started a couple of days after this sweater debuted, and i snagged it right away. i just got it and am in love. it fits true to size and the shoulders and sleeves are everything i hoped they would be. the neckline in very flattering as well. it is soft and the color is gorgeous. if there is a negative, it would be that it is a bit boxy in the torso, and doe",pos

"The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that's just that....looks. i'm 5'2"" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn't like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn't realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it.",neg
"When i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store, it instantly caught my attention. since it was pricey, i didn't get it. when it went on sale, it ran out in my size. so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for 20% off the sale price. this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt.",pos
"Saturday/sunday never disappoints! love this black cardigan. runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me. not a problem anywhere else though. good medium weight to the fabric. durable quality and waist flattering once tied. great for throwing on over a dress, wearing with a t-shirt",pos
"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid",pos
"This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp, so i did not expect this to fit, but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite, many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1"" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos, and not when you search for sweaters. it",pos
Very pleased with my purchase! the subtle details within the dress add to its simple elegance. very soft and comfortable; definitely recommend!,pos
"When i received this top, i thought it was even prettier than the online picture. the colors and beading are more vibrant in person. it is a full cut and does have an elastic band at the bottom but i liked the way it looked on. i ordered my usual size m and it fit me the same as it did the model in the picture. it is pretty shear. if you wear it to work or during the daytime, it will need a cami. however, in evening lighting, i don't find it to be that see through and i feel comfortable wearing",pos
"I got this top in the beige, size small. it is flattering and though i hadn't noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it, they are a nice touch. this is a versatile piece. i can dress it up or down. this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season.",pos
"I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i don't typically buy this style of dress because many times, they are unflattering on me. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs, in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up would've resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect, above my knee; not too short, but short enough so i don't look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully, and i can wear it with tights and boots now, and capri tights and wedge sandals in",pos
"I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.",pos
"I love these. the white actually has a more pronounced look between the top and bottom with a little but of shading. since they look a bit different because of that i got both white and black. perfect wait and not to giant, and perfect for year round work. the shawl color is a tad flimsy in how it sits but overall these are fabulous.",pos
Pilcro pants are always a positive purchase. quality fabric. great design. i purchased the pink for spring and whenever. prettier in person than on line. they are a peachy pink color. will go with anything. dress them up or down.,pos
"Online this jacket is supposedly an online exclusive, but i saw it in green at my local store. i had to try it on and i loved it. it does swing but is not to much fabric. the drape is really nice it is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it sort of shows that on the model but is much more noticeable in person. this jacket is not lined and i would say more of a shirt. this is perfect for spring or cooler summer nights or over a tank or short sleeve in the winter. i also love lyocell it j",pos
This top turned out to be better than expected! i'm a large girl and the length is enough to cover my hips and the shirt it not tight at all. the embroidery details are lovely too. i bought this for a trip to italy this summer because it is cotton and because i consider it to be a classic piece being that it is black and white. one nice feature is this top does not have to be worn off shoulder. it looks just great with the sleeves up.,pos
I looooove these pants. i was looking for a cool pair of white pants since last summer. i tried them on and they make my bootie look great. they are also not see through which i love. i love this brand and these pants will be my new summer staple! ps. they were a bit snug then relaxed a little after 2 wears.,pos
"Love the material -- it is a thick cotton, but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it doesn't cling to me (in a bad way). its like wearing a sweater. my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette. (the black material is the same as the gray and it also has a herringbone pattern thats not really visible in the pictures) i would have preferred a uniform material rather than a panel sewn in. not a huge d",pos
"This dress is incredibly soft! with sleeves that can be rolled up or down, it is extremely versatile. while the dress is very comfortable and mostly fits true to size, i found it to be ever so slightly snug through the hips at first. however, i am somewhat difficult to fit with an accentuated hourglass figure. overall, i am very happy with this purchase and look forward to wearing it during my travels!",pos
"I was so pleasantly surprised when i received this in the mail, because it's much more substantial than i thought it would be. it's perfect for fall and spring and the lining is very soft. i thought it'd be more difficult to wear but it goes well with everything! i ordered my usual size small and am happy with the fit.",pos
"I am 5'3, 120 lbs and i got xs petite. it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone. as stated in my review title, the material is quite heavy and great quality, which helps it hang nicely. cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional. love it with my lace-up espadrilles!",pos
It is one of my favorites from retailer. i received so many compliments while wearing it! i usually wear a 6 but i sized down to a 4 and still had plenty of room.,pos
"Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front",neg
"I love these shorts. love that the inseam is longer than 3"". the pattern is awesome, perfect for spring. my thighs are always going to be bigger than most, so i sized up 1 size like i do in all cartonnier pants. these are a must have for spring/summer!",pos
"Top is blouse and long enough to stay tucked in if you want.  like the laser cut detail front and back.  sleeveless is great for summer months here.  can wear to work or dress down with jeans.  fit is true to size.  i am 5'5"", slim and small busted so anything fits me.  i would think it you're busty it would be fine as it's a blousy fit.
the color is more of a salmon pink which works for me.  however if your looking for a true pink it may not work.",pos
Very flattering ang comfy but they do run slightly big. i stayed with my true size because i am thicker in waist but if small waisted size down. fit ty's in legs and bottom. love color!,pos
"To be honest, i bought this sweater as an add-on so i could get free shipping; however, it's the only piece i actually kept from the order! this sweatshirt is warm (fleece-lined) and just the right amount of billow. but the best part is the subtle lavender color; when i ordered it, i didn't even realize i ordered lavender (again, i wasn't paying much attention to this piece!), but the color and texture are so soft...definitely a must buy! for reference, i am 5'3, 110 pounds and the xs (my usual",pos
Cute twist with the open back on a simple classic sweater... light weight...,pos
This top is just amazing. it does run large so size down but fit and feel is wonderful especially if you would like to hide some lumps and bumps this is the perfect top.,pos
"Gorgeous shirt! the detail on this shirt is impeccable! even with its boxy shape, it was very flattering on my petite, curvy frame. i'd say this shirt runs just a tad big. i'm 5' 118lbs and the xs fit perfectly.",pos
"I'm in love ... with this super cute dress!!! the material feels so good on my skin and it has more 'body' than it appears on the pic ! i'm 5'2"" 115 lbs - i bought the s petite and it's perfect for me - slightly loose - i could have probably fit in an xs but i like the freedom that the s gives me! it my official spring dress !",pos
"I love this top so much online. i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed.  there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online. also, this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest. it looks nice and drapey on the model. when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top (thanks to my 38dds) looks more like a swing top. i'm sure it's a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest.",neg
"I loved how this looked on the model, however, once i tried on in store, i was greatly disappointed. i usually wear a meduim and the small and extra-small were huge on me. there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this. i had such high hopes for this. there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped.",neg
"I saw this dress online and fell in love with it. it is just as beautiful in person too. very delicate, but receive so many compliments every time i wear. it is two separate pieces, a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress. i am 5'4"" and need a 2 inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging. probably could have tried to order the petite but figured i'd probably be wearing heals anyway. i normally wear a 6/8 in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering! the top half is flow",pos
"I'm in love with this dress and first tried on the petite size in the store. if you don't have enormous shoulders (which i do) , i think the petite would fit someone in the 5'6"" range. what i'm trying to say is the dress is pretty long. the cut is beautiful and patterns perfectly complementary. i've been reading marie kondo's book and this one ""sparks joy""!",pos
Only negative thing is that it sheds. and even that is not really very negative! i would buy it again in a heartbeat.,pos
This dress is beautiful and extremely well made. there is s little more weight to the fabric than i had assumed but it's nice for fall/transition/cooler temps. i'm so sad that i will most likely return this dress because it's just not working on my postpartum body but there is a part of me that wants to keep it because of how stunning it is.,pos
"Loving the ombrã© color combination, the smooth lining, the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass, stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted, size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top, i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want, do try it on in person.",pos
"The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet, that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the ""hem"" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible.",neg
"This dress did not disappoint. it fits great. i'm 5'3"" and weigh 114 and i got a petite xs. length was perfect, i have a longer torso, so the waist was a bit higher than mine, but it didn't sit strangely and hung well. i am small chested, and the top fit me very well, i think if you have been blessed in that area, you may want to size up. 
overall, it really is beautiful, the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer. i",pos
"I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length, i'm 5'8"" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry, no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!",pos
Love!! so comfy! i wish they came in more colors. i'd order every one!!,pos
"The cut is on the boxy side and i'm not sold on the tiered effect, but i love the silk fabric and the print so much that i just don't care. the silk is deliciously light and breathable, and the print is neutral enough that i can pair it with several different cardigans and necklaces to mix it up. and the quality of construction is excellent--all of the seams were expertly sewn and pressed, and the print was lined up like in the online picture. given the material and construction quality, it's de",pos
"I liked everything about this tunic except the way that it looked on me. the fabric was great - not too heavy, not too light. the design was cute and i loved the colors (i got the yellow). it was cut well, and a good length for me (i am 5'2""). that being said, i am curvy and i felt like i looked even rounder in this top. if i was 6-8"" taller it probably would have been perfect.",pos
"I was so excited to receive the playa tunic in the mail! i love the colors and the flowy bottom and raw edges. this tunic could be worn as a dress or with jeggings, jeans, or leggings. this is a wonderful fall transition piece!!",pos
I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.,neg
"Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist.  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable. i typically am a m/l in retailer.  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them. if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose, these are not see through at all. (i ordered the color shown on the model) i am about 5 feet 4 so the pants are not as cropped on me .",pos
"I would wear this everyday if i could. the red color is so rich and the cut and structure of the top is perfect and flattering. i've worn to work, out, or dressed down with jeans and flip flops.",pos
"Love this blazer - it's a heavy jersey fabric, which is comfortable all day, with no wrinkling. and it has a cute light grey jersey knit trim around the pockets which adds visual interest and keeps it from being a boring navy blazer. the sizing is correct - i wear a 6, and the 6 fits perfectly. it's got a slightly athletic 'boyfriend' fit - it's not boxy, but don't look for a really skinny tight fit around the waste.",pos
"The sweater runs large, the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however, the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater, but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly, you're a genius.",neg
"I bought this in the pattern in a size medium. i am a size 4-6 (38"" around the hips/butt). the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves. the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didn't outline every curve of my butt. the material is very soft and comfortable, but it didn't feel thin or cheap or see-through. it has a nice weight to it. i am tall (almost 5' 9"") and it fit me just as it appears in the picture.",pos
Wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy. i havent worn skorts since the 90s and this was such a nice return to that trend. :-),pos
"I spotted this dress at my local retailer. to be honest, i saw it on a rack with a sale sign on it and didn't think much of it. then i saw it on a salesperson...wow! i think this dress looks much better on someone than on the hanger...so i recommend trying it on.

i am 5'3"", 32b...and i bought an xs. it fits really well...right about the knee, similar to how it is shown in the photo so taller women may find it to be a little shorter.

the ruffle/fabric that comes down the side adds an interesting",pos
"This is a comfortable and easy shirt that is meant to be slightly looser. i wear a size small in all cloth and stone and found this shirt to be true to size. the extra small was too tight in the shoulders and didn't have the right look to it.

same fabric as my other cloth and stone items, however, i had to steam the cuffed sleeves and back pleating after washing and drying to make it look nice and crisp. also, the cuffed sleeves are sewn that way, which i like.",pos
This is a very pretty top with a nice flow. i love the delicate pattern. it fits perfectly and is great for work or the weekend.,pos
"I'm really pleased with this jumpsuit. it has great detailing not visible in the online image and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. the navy is lovely. i'm normally a medium or size 4-6. i ordered the medium online and it was far too baggy, especially on top. i tried on the small and x small in store and the x small fit exactly how i wanted (as worn by the model) and the pants were still long enough. i'm glad i didn't give up on it.",pos
I was not a fan of these leggings. these were very unflattering. i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out. i just didn't feel like they would hold up for even one season.,neg
"While i wouldn't normally look at this piece, the price was unbeatable. i was even more impressed when it arrived and i tried it on! the design is reminiscent of an old time patchwork quilt fairy tale- more beautiful in person than in the pic. the covered buttons at the neck and wrists are just lovely and feminine, and the dress falls and flows around me in a fun and flirty way. i paired it with charcoal heather tights and dark gray booties- super cute! you won't regret it.",pos
"I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it's loose and flows but doesn't look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said, i hand washed it, as the tag states, then let it line dry, and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states ""dry clean recommended."" boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once.",neg
As other reviewers have stated it is hard to see in the photos that the dress has iridescent blue/pink/lavender sequins. i was surprised as well but in a good way. i think it has a unique look and is so pretty and romantic. its a vision of shimmer when you are walking. if you have somewhat of a bust i would size up because the triangles run a little small. other than that its a beautiful dress.,pos
"This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be...it is super soft, comfortably loose, but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it's just the right amount of sexy. it will be my go-to this fall and winter!",pos
Material was a tad rough for my liking. the color did nothing for my olive complexion. given the price of this shirt (even with 20% off) i don't think it's worth it. if i'm spending $100+ on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this one...going back.,neg
"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger, so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy, 5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving, fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models, or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!",pos
"Beautiful material- and washable!! i'm vertically challenged and the slits are a tad bit high, even for me- but still tasteful. i would suggest sizing down as i'm normally a medium in retailer but due to the nature of the material i opted to size down and i'm so glad i did!! no arm hole struggles with my particular dress either. overall just a really cute, versatile, cozy and functional option that will certainly get plenty of exposure for many winters to come.",pos
"I found this dress to run true to size. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs and the xs fits great. perfect length and i like the thicker fabric so it's not see through. the raw edges lend a cool laid back and the final embroidery is a perfect bohemian touch. wearing mine with a turquoise choker. awesome dress!",pos
"I wore this dress for an after party the day of my wedding day in new orleans. going to a music lounge!! seriously, i kept getting compliments!!! it's fits beautiful and i just love the different type of patterns!",pos
"Saw this in the catalog and had to have it.  i paid full price!   while the buttons aren't functional, it is not too revealing.  i work in a casual office and it will be perfectly appropriate especially paired with a jean jacket!   the length is right above knee.  i am 5'6"" 122# and went with the xs",pos
"These pants are flattering and comfortable, plus they are cute, cute, cute. i'm a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top, but with a solid black or ivory/off white top they are perfect. can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or ""girlfriends'"" lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck. highly recommend",pos
This top is huge! i'm typically a size 2 or 4. i bought the 2 and its huge. it's wider than it is long. even if i sized down to a 0 it would still be too much fabric. i'm so disappointed! beautiful color and fabric but there's so much fabric. i love a flowy top but this one is way too much. :( i will be returning this top.,neg
Kind of excited about this little number. i found it online and was immediately drawn to the boho-chic look. it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo.,pos
"Full disclosure, i'm six months pregnant. as such, this dress is perfect for me. it's soft and flown, and i look like i have a cute bump instead of like i'm wearing a sack. i ordered my usual medium based on other reviews, and t fits perfectly--so it would have been too big normally.",pos
Made my wedding outfit perfect!,pos

This sweater is gorgeous. ordered in the grey motif. was as described and wonderfully soft. i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all. i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs. looking forward to the colder months!,pos
"I love this skirt! it's a denim material, so it's structured, but not too heavy for warm weather. the colors are bright. it may run a bit big, but i didn't have trouble with my usual size. the pockets are actually usable. great for casual and easy to dress up.",pos
"Pretty color, but i was hoping for a thicker, higher quality material for the price. the material is lightweight and isn't tailored well. looks kind of sloppy.",neg
Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try. the material seems cheap and stiff. would not fit my frame well.,neg
"I love this skirt for so many reasons! 
one, it isn't a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt, the description states that it's a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2"" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.",pos
"Bought this dress for a friend's wedding. i have since worn it to two others and the opera numerous times. it's my favorite little black dress as it's sexy and modest at the same time. i receive numerous compliments every time i wear it! it's easy to get into, the zipper is sturdy and the fabric is breathable, stretchy but not clingy.",pos

This shirt fits really well- i ordered a size small and it's definitely a bit form fitting. i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first- for a tshirt it's a pretty hefty price. but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny.,pos
"This is the most comfortable, sweet, beautiful, romantic and timeless dress. i bought the green motif one is sz 14 and it fits perfectly. i am smaller chested (usually a 12/medium/large up top depending on the item) and a sz 14/xl/33 for pants so perhaps this dress runs one size small? the color in the detail shot is most accurate - it's bright & cheerful and dreamy.",pos
"This dress is beautiful, and the a line shape is very flattering. i'm 5'10"" and it hits just above my knees. i'm small on top, so the keyhole slit isn't an issue for me, but it does gap more than it does on the model. this dress has lots of versatility.  like another reviewer said, you can dress it up with heels, or dress it down with boots.",pos
"I tried this on in the store in a medium by accident, thinking that it was a large. i loved it even though the front was way too short on me and the elastic waist was way too tight. the store didn't have the next size up and after reading the other reviews i decided to order my standard xl online. its a keeper! i am plus sized and have an ample mid section and this was still flattering on me. i plan to wear it with a black duster sweater, leggings, and boots all winter long and then when the wea",pos

"There wasn't much question as to whether or not i'd love these pants, as i have several pairs of the pilcro ""hyphen"" pant; however, this one is slightly different (front pocket's and seam down front),

these pants are a great weight--can wear year round, really--but these will be my ""go to"" pants this fall and winter.
the length is nice--can wear with shoes or rolled up with boots, too--""utility"" chinos? yes!

the fit is nicely",pos
"What a beautiful flowing top. i am either a large or xl in tops but only needed a large in this top. i purchased it in the neutral color, but will probably get it in plum. if you have some flaws in your middle, this conceals everything. the material is so soft. you can dress it up or down and wear it from now until late fall. the plum color was beautiful, but i have more to wear with neutral. a great, versatile top.",pos
"Great chinos, but they run a size large. i ordered my normal pants size and had to return them for one size down. i actually like them so much after finding the right size, i bought a second pair in store. i have the grey and mustard yellow. love them! just order a size down!",pos

this is an adorable and flattering dress. fabric is kind of a chino. weighty but not too heavy. great color and design. runs a bit small. my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size. i love it and would buy it in more colors!",pos
"I love this top--the fabric, the color, they way it hangs. i'm glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low, so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect. it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra wouldn't show.",pos
"I don't have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine. i also ordered the xs even though i'm usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked. already returned it. on the plus side, it's gorgeous.",neg
I love this dress! it flatters so nicely. i'm 5'3 and pretty thin. it hugs all my curves snugly.,pos
"I was hesitant to buy this dress with all the reviews regarding poor fit, particularly in the bust area, but it's so unique that i decided to give it a try anyway by ordering a petite size. i was pleasantly surprised to find that it fits beautifully in my usual size. i did not find the bust to be small at all, and the overall fit was very slimming and flattering. for reference, i am 5'2"" 110lbs 32dd, and the size 2p looks great and is very comfortable.  the 0p might have worked too. the material",pos
"These jeans look great with everything and fit great. i can dress them up with wedges or throw them on with flip flops and they are so comfortable, too. i've had many compliments already.",pos
"I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back.",pos
"Love this top, i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size. very comfortable and true to size.",pos
"I have been a loyal retailer customer for at least 10 years now, so i don't say this lightly; this might be my favorite clothing purchase ever. the overall design is incredible. the feminine detail in the embroidery combined with the traditional bomber style is done so well. i somehow snagged a medium petite and it is absolutely perfect. there is enough room to fit a sweater underneath, but the sleeves and waist are the perfect length! something which is difficult to find at 5'2"". also, i must say",pos
"The dress is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is light, the pattern is not overwhelming and has a zipper on the side to make it more fitted in the waist. the top is blousy, but i am only a c cup and it still was perfect. the bottom has an uneven cut that makes the dress very interesting. i love it. i am usually a size 2 or 4 and the size 4 was perfect.",pos
"This is a really great bathing suit top. i haven't purchased a bikini in about 4 years so i'm glad this is the one i finally purchased. the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous. the fabric itself is soft and comfortable. i listed it as a 'true to size' fit, but if you're on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage. i'm a size 8 through and through, and so ordered a m per their size standards. the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette",pos
"I chose this dress for my engagement photoshoot and i'm so glad i did! it is beyond beautiful, my favorite dress ever!",pos
"This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape, and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and wouldn't be able to wear it as a dress, but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece, this one is a winner!",pos
"This dress looks better in person. nice navy with subtle pattern - looks super cute with a really lightweat pale yellow sweater! i thought that wiastband area would hit in a funky spot (my problem area) but it doesnt and looks great. super comfortable and i love this neckline. also has a decent lining so no bra necessary if youre cool with that. i have packed on some ""after 50"" lbs and wear a 12-14 shirt and 10-12 pant and the large is roomy enough.i received a number of compliments and let's fa",pos
"This is a modernized hippie sweater, so beautiful. blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality. the large flowers add attitude, pockets show comfort. it is soft (part silk fabric) and lays nicely. it is not thick enough for warmth, but there is room for a tissue turtleneck. regular s fits me well (it should be relaxed look, not fitted) and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and the hem falls right above my knees).",pos
These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!,pos
"This white shirt is a perfect canvas. i can dress it up with a scarf for work or wear it with my favorite jeans. it's perfect for all body shapes with the a-line. i love how comfortable this shirt feels. i like wearing this shirt with my black knit pants, and my retailers braided collar vest.",pos
True to size and fits great. the sleeves are the perfect size and it's so versatile.,pos
"Because of my body type, i never thought i could wear a romper. i tried this on out of curiosity and am so glad i did. it fits well (i did size up because of my thighs), is comfortable, and an alternative to a dress. the patterned bottom did not accentuate my lower body, which was a worry. i got compliments when i wore this to dinner with a pair of sandals.",pos
"I bought this dress to wear to my graduation where i was receiving a degree in horticulture. i also just had a child a few weeks prior and was worried about sizing. the high waist worked well for the post pregnancy belly. i am 5'3"" and was typically around 130 lbs pre-pregnancy which was typically a 4 in dresses. i ordered a 6 petite in this dress and it was perfect! the only area that was sort of tight was the bosom but i am nursing so i expected as much. the petite length was perfect for my he",pos
Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .,pos
"This shirt is comfortable, loose, but doesn't make you look like you're shapeless. it compliments.",pos
This shirt is just precious! i cannot wait to pair it with a pair of white skinny jeans and wedges in the spring. i'm so in love with it. the detail is just beautiful.,pos
"I'm always looking for something that is unique and can be layered. this looks just like it does on the model. you'll need a cami underneath as it is not lined. a little shorter in front than in the back but drapes nicely. styled it with black denim ankle jeans, black loafers (or boots), and a blue denim jacket. i'm 118#, 34d, 5'4"" and the s fit well.",pos
"I absolutely love this top. i am short (5'2"") but curvy on the bottom with a 36dd bust. i ordered the xl, only because of my upper body. it fits great, as i don't like anything to hug my body. but it doesn't look like a tent. has a little a-line shape to it. another reason i go for the larger size is i like to dry all my clothes. ordered the grey and will order in the black, also.",pos
"I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin, and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material, but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric, with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex",neg
"This is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall. it is 100% rayon, so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin. it is also washable. i think it looks much better in person than online.
i opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and even-looking, as it tended to gap slightly at the top..

"I am not someone who normally wears overalls (this is actually my first pair!) but i'm so glad that i took the plunge and bought these. they fit amazingly while being both perfectly trendy and perfectly timeless. if you are on the fence about overalls in general, these are a perfect first pair.

i'm a 25 in most denim brands and was also a 25 in these. the bottom portion fits perfectly and doesn't look sloppy (like i assumed overalls would be) at all! the top is perfectly casual. 

i'm so ha",pos
"I'm fussy about robes. i'm fairly small (size 2 or 4) and a lot of robes swamp me. in the smaller size, this robe fit well and was flattering. the material is soft but absorbent. the pattern is lovely and feminine without being dowdy. the wrap is generous--i wear this robe just out of the shower and don't feel exposed.",pos
"These are great, but unfortunately ran small for me in comparison to my other pilcro jeans. i returned and the size i need is sold out now.",pos
"This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase, and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try, and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7"", 120lbs, slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short, but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi",pos

"This top is even more beautiful and vibrant in person, but you definitely need a racerback cami underneath it as the laser cuts are big. the first time i wore it today, i got a number of compliments. a definite keeper.",pos
"This dress fits really cute. i actually think it's cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model, so it's appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3, 110lbs. i got the 0 and it's great!",pos
I own many blouses by tiny. the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me. the shirt was just blah.,neg
"I love this top! i ordered the print, and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans, and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews, and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.",pos
"This caftan is very light and well-made. i love the colors and designs on this fabric. i was worried that it might make me look boxy, but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well. the fabric is so soft!!! i'm amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful cover-up.",pos
"I get more compliments on the stress. it is perfect for work, perfect for summer night concert, perfect date night. love this dress!",pos
"Was excited to try this interesting skirt, as a mega bailey 44 fan. however, this skirt didn't fit well. the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xs/size 0. my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and i'm not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines weren't flattering to the body. the ""vegan"" quilting isn't luxurious. i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesn't lay to advantage when worn and i'm an easy fit. length is so-so,",neg
I love this tee s much i bought 3 different colors! the back is beautiful. it is so comfy and soft but its added spice makes it perfect for those times you want a little more style.,pos
I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.,neg
"I bought these last year and loved them, however they came in tall sizes. this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short, even at 33"". im 5'7"" and  they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg. i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal",neg
I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.,pos
"I saw this sweater online and i fell in love with it! i was hoping to wear it for christmas. it arrived on time and it was such an amazing color. there is a touch of orange to the red color. it has a buttoned collar, and i like wearing it with one button open. it has to be one of the softest, most comfy sweaters i've ever worn. i wore it with skinny jeans and boots. it would be fine with leggings, too. the style and quality is superb, as always. i'm very pleased with this purchase!",pos
I just received this dress tried it on. i totally fell in love with it . the pink is just beautiful.it's a little big so i will definitely will be exchanging it for a size 14 . you would absolutely love this dress.,pos
"This was my first time to purchase and wear a tunic and i was very hesitant about the look, but i love this design! it is beautiful and seems to be very well made. i agree with a previous reviewer that the slit is high (it comes to my waist, but i don't think it is a problem. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2"", 117 lbs, and a small 32b. the xs works well for me.",pos
"This jumpsuit runs large so i sized down perfectly one full size down. i have a size b chest and was very comfortable with no bra, as the built in cups gave me the perfect coverage. it looked like a dress standing, but had such a flattering and fun shape when you move. everyone loved it!",pos
"Love these pants! super comfortable, but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly.",pos
"Bought this dress as a winter dress. it looks amazing, and even more so with some boots. love it. also, its more gray than blue, although i like that.",pos
"Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern. i almost got the black because i thought it would be 'timeless' but the print is so fun - i'm glad i went with it! ordered a size m - for reference, i am 5'6, 135lbs, 34c, 28/39 and the fit is comfortable. i don't need a lot of support :) and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom. i think it'll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip. this is the first one-piece i've had since i was a gi",pos
"I love this dress. i got the coral, and it's clean and simple, but with visually interesting lines. the top is a slightly heavier, stretchy fabric (no zippers or closures), while the skirt is made of a lighter fabric that gives it a bit of flirty swing. the hem is also slightly a-symmetrical, which i didn't notice from the online pictures. it's a very comfortable dress that i could see being very versatile - dressed up for work, dressed down for daytime weekend wear, or even for date night.

Ooo la la! sooo chic! sooo retailer!!,pos
"The fabric is very light weight, more of a shirting material.  this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture.  the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes.  it is so soft and light!  there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining.  the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right.  very flattering.  it does run big tho",pos
"If you're a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering. hangs nicely in the front, not too clingy. also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat. the plum is gorgeous! was king it for the first time so can't yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation.",pos
"I love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same. the cut and the fit are free and easy, so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore? washes well, hang dry, easy to care for. i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style!",pos
"I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color, pattern, slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.",pos
I wasn't sure how the fabric would be since i ordered it online but i wasn't disappointed. its got a lot of movement which makes it really comfortable while still being cute. it's a little longer than i anticipated but i don't mind that. it just gives it a little more versatility. also it has pockets!! i love pockets so maybe i'm a little biased.,pos
"A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!",pos

"This must be the only structured t shirt at retailer at the time of this review. i love it. the neckline is perfection. the ruched sleeves are long enough to cover my upper arms. i found it a bit see through, and added a white cami.

"This dress is gorgeous, but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly. i'm 5'10"" and tried both the petite (thinking it would fall more like a midi), and the regular, hoping it would fit like a maxi should. both hit at a very awkward spot on my mid-shin... as much as i loved and wanted it, it looked too weird to justify buying.",pos
I bought the mauve color and it's very pretty. i felt as though sizing up was a better choice. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small. i liked the length of the small better. the shoulders add a cute look to it.,pos

"I love this dress! i am 5'3"" 117 lbs and ordered the size 0. the fit is excellent and is very flattering. the color is more kelly green than what is shown in the picture, and is lovely. i wore it to my 40th celebration and adored wearing the dress!",pos
"I have an upside-down triangle shape. i am a 4/6 on the bottom and a 10/12 on top. i have a short waist. i have very slim hips and virtually no waist. so, a typical jumpsuit or romper really doesn't fit me. this one is the exception! likely because it ties in the back, but the s fit me perfectly. the bottom half is easy, but not oversized. the top half of the jumpsuit is adjustable, so there is no issue with size. i am 36c on top, but i think that i could pull off the top, without a bra. you can",pos
"An absolutely gorgeous, but poorly fitting blouse. the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half. got it on sale and still returned it.",neg
"Just picked this up at the store 40% off sale price, well worth it! the petite hits perfect on my 5'3"" frame, right about where it hits the model in the pic. very well made good quality piece i can see myself wearing quite often.",pos
"These pants are very, very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.",pos
"I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake, but i received the chiffon shell, but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes, but sadly, this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now, so i can't even reorder. bummer.",neg
"I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great. the fabric is thin, which is nice for summer, but lined at the top half so it's not transparent except below the knee. the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit. i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite. sadly, it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length. i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast!",pos
"Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down, though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.",pos

Love this jacket. it fits very well and is super comfortable. you can wear it to work or on the weekends. super versatile!,pos
"I ordered a size large.  i recently had a baby and was looking for a top to hide my baby belly until i lose it.  this shirt fits amazingly.  i don't find the sleeves to be snug at all.  if the shirt wasn't so distinctive, i'd order in several colors.  the quality is fantastic for a tee and has a nubbed appearance you can't see in the photos.",pos
"Ordered this blouse in a small but it was too big, returned it for an xs. i weigh 123 lbs , i'm 5'3 1/2"".
i find sizing of clothing at retailer to be unreliable, i have had to return many items because of sizing issues. unfortunately i live too far away from a regular store so have to rely on shopping on line.
i will complement retailer on the unique designs of the clothing they offer.",pos

"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",neg
"Ordered online, hedging my bets on size (chose xs/s) because i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and wear anything from 2-8 sizes depending on brand. my gamble paid off - it&#39;s a beautiful sweater. soft, comfortable, nice drape.

This top is perfect! very comfortable and flattering for any body type.,pos

"This bathing suit has everything. i especially love the ruching in the waist and the boy short bottom. finally the coverage my booty needs. i've worn it dozens of times and it still holds its quality and looks brand new. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear it.
the only drawback is it doesn't dry very quickly. after a dip in the pool or the lake it stays wet for hours even when i'm laying out in the summer heat.",pos
I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.,pos
Material is thick and warm. print is very pretty. i received complements from all age groups. fits a little boxy but it works.,pos
These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!,pos
"I ordered this online in a sz 4, perfect fit and very comfortable. the side slits make it even more interesting since jeans or leggings will show!",pos
"I have other stevies, and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist, approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally, the cuff is sewn like that in place, and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like, a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!",neg
This dress is so cute and comfortable. i'm normally a 0 or 2 and the xs is plenty roomy even though this is a clingy knit. the nice cotton under slip hides all the bumps and bulges. only worry is whether or not the loose weave will pick and how it will clean but so far i am thrilled.,pos
"I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isn't my first choice. that was the least of the problems with this jacket. i love sparkle, and i love beautiful detail, none of the elements by themselves was a problem. the sum of the parts didn't work, though. the end result was an unflattering, confusing mess. the silhouette plus the frayed edges, plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast, plus the zipper were just too many things to go t",neg
"This skirt is great, a classic. the little dots on the skirt give it some character while remaining a simple black and flattering skirt. the material lays nicely and flat. it does not make me look like i have a stomach. the skirt fits tts. i am a little afraid that the waistband will stretch out over time so i might exchange it for one size smaller. overall, i love the skirt!",pos
"I purchased this jacket on pure impulse. to be quite honest it reminds me of a coat my dad used to wear, and i was halfway on the way to retailer when i decided to try it on. my goodness it's perfect. it's slightly oversized, delightfully 70's and makes everything look good skirts, pants, dresses etc. buy it, especially off the 70's have a special place in your heart.",pos
"But, it just doesn't measure up. first, the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and, once on, the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately, i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute, but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.",neg
"I got this in the floral print before it sold out, and i have never received so many compliments on a dress! it hangs so nicely and is so flattering. the neckline doesn't bother me at all (i know some reviewers mentioned that), but i am a very small busted woman so maybe it has something to do with that? i find it super comfortable, like wearing a nightgown. i am so in love with this dress i just ordered it again in black. it will be a summer staple. i found it runs true to size (i'm 5'3"", 115 p",pos
"Got this for my daughter who lives out of town. i plan on bringing it to her during my next visit. i love it! the style is up to date and pretty. it's a perfect dress for almost any occasion! i'm hoping it will fit her, but the sizing looks right to me and the quality is great!",pos
"I just tried these on today in the store. i'm 5'5 and found that they were definitely the right length for heels. the 33"" inseam is correct. however, i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats. these are super cute jeans!!!",pos
"My stylist brought me the regular xs to try on in the store and almost told me i should buy it... the length seemed just fine, but i usually get petite so decided to order the xs petite before deciding... good decision, there is less fabric in the skirt, so it seemed anyway, so i am less overwhelmed buy the skirt. the cut is super flattering, and length was actually better (the longer sides hit ,me around the knee). i wasn't sold on the dolor, as i have pale skin, but there is enough dark to com",pos
I bought this yesterday in store in the red color. normally i wouldn't spend this much money on an everyday dress- but there was no way i could walk out of the store without it! the fabric and fit are amazing. the dress has a chic-ness about it that makes you look completely put together but doesn't make you look like you are trying too hard. perfect balance of comfort and style. i'm seriously thinking i need it in black as well!,pos

"This little pantie is fun and playful. its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details. the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque. the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me. i'm a small lass, but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly.",pos
"I know this is supposed to look oversized, and i own a few oversized ponchos, but this takes oversized to a whole new level.  i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference.  if you are looking for that, it seemed like good qualify.",neg
No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.,neg
I purchased this sweater in a small . nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves! it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear! it went back i hate dolman sleeves.,neg
"This is a beautiful top, the pattern reminds me very much of mola designs stitched in panama. i love the contrast of the red stitching against the white background. i'm not as crazy about the buttons on the back sides- not sure what that detail adds to the piece. it is a boxy shape, so be aware it's not going to hug the figure. the cotton is soft and medium weight. overall, it's a stand-out!",pos

two suggestions for improvement: 1) i wish is that they were a uniform dark blue wash (but the fadng and whiskering is barely noticeable). 2) i also wish they'd place the butt pockets a little higher, especia",pos
"This blouse was exactly what i was looking for. perfect for those last balmy days of summer. fabric a bit sheer, but it flows beautifully and the pleating details and higher neckline make this top truly stunning. it is very flowy, so if you're looking for something more fitted, this might not be for you.",pos

The style was really cute but the fit was huge. i ordered an xs. i don't think going to the xxs would have helped. i ended up returning it.,neg

Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.,neg

floral prints caught my eye at the first sight, so i had been desperate to have it!

i historically wear 00p in jcrew and most retailer brands. i purchased a 0p and it fit well with a little room. i really hated that the waistline is almost a drop-waist. the ivory brocade panel comes low on the navel, so it makes you look shorter than you really are.

the most impressive part of this dress is the neckline/shoulder. i have pretty narrow shoulders, so it's a quasi-boatneck and it's quite lovely.",pos
"This is a nice, soft shirt that is very comfortable to wear. the collar on this shirt makes this more than just a regular shirt. although the shirt seems more fitted on the model, i found it to run large. if you are going for the same look, you might want to size down. however, i like the shirt and am keeping it. it is a good thing too, because the navy color went fast. very nice shirt and a pretty good price too.",pos

my experience with mih is that the sizing runs true, or european, and thus small. i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless. it looked horrible from every angle: front, back and sides. i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller size.

"I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slim/straight and/or petite figure. fit-and-flare dresses simply will not work for you; it's the entire purpose behind the ""flare"" shape at the hip. it will be too large for women without wider hips.

I was a little hesitant about sizing based on reviews-but my normal small fit perfectly. it is a little low cut for work-but with a scarf will be fine. i wish it was a bit shorter (hits just below the knees on me).but overall great. i have a fairly straight body type and think dress probably works best on this type. although if you were small on top and curvy on bottom i think this could be cute too. for the price point (with the sale) its definitely worth trying! i got the black and white-and i,pos

I love this shirt. wore it today and got many compliments. i bought the mauve (looks lilac to me). it's very comfy and long. its got a lovely swing feel which is great for covering my baby belly.,pos
"I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.

"I really love this this dress, but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waist-it is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps, but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin tops/bulges.i would have loved this if the belt went all the way around. one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal. i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color, but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i",pos

This is the perfect summer top. super lightweight but with a little swing in it so it is not tight across the hips. the bright colors go with almost anything and the detailing at the top makes this dressier than a regular shirt. great with skirts and jeans!,pos

"I stumbled upon this as a return to our store. at first, i was a little put off by the change in stitching to add support and shape. but once you put it on, it's perfect. it's very flattering and very comfortable. there are snaps in the crotch, but i wore it for a full day (8+ hours) and had no discomfort. if there were more colors, i'd buy them all lol.",pos
"Wonderfully soft fabric and gorgeous pattern. the background color is a more standard gray than shows in the on-line photo (which looks more pinkish gray on my screen), but it's just lovely -- looks perfect with jeans or a skirt. i will be wearing this a lot this fall, and will keep a lookout for additional patterns!",pos
"What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.",neg
"I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it, and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter, but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes, definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!",pos

"I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on. despite the store only carrying this in petites, i tried it on anyway and didn't want to take it off! it's very wearable and comfortable. the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down. i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely.

"This top is perfect! i'm 5'9"" and a medium build, and it's hard to find tops that have long enough sleeves. this is really long! i love the weight of the fabric - perfect under a coat and heavy enough for cool texas winter days. the fabric is really soft and the color is a blue-ish grey. the style is feminine but not too girlie. it's my new go to top!!",pos
Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,neg

love it - great fit.(tts)
would recommend",pos
Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,neg

Have only tried on but it is a very cute skirt and i think will be comfortable to wear. i love the texture of the material. i do wish it came in other colors. it is a little heavier material but not too much.,pos
"I love this top. i got it thinking i'd wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more. it pairs great with cut-off shorts, white jeans, denim jeans. i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also un-tucked for a more casual look. i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it. i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it. very happy with it!",pos
My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small. the button popped and i had barely moved. do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust. the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work.,neg
"What s lovely surprise this jacket/cape/poncho is!  first, it is a substantial piece.  heavier than it appears.  it has an almost faux suede feel to it, with a deliciously lush french terry lining.  it looks and feels very rich.  i bought both colors and was glad i did!  i live on the coast and this will be fantastic over a sweater for morning walks along the shore.  i'm a l/xl and the m/l size is a perfect fit!",pos
"I was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own (she knows a lot of what i own). it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish. the cut is also flattering, though i think i'll have to wear a strapless bra. color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan. i purchased the 0 regulr, tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much. i am 115 lbs 30",pos
"This shirt dress will make a great piece for the summer to throw on. the length is perfect for either a dress or throw on some tights as a shirt. i bought the beige color one and it's a little see through. would def need to wear a slip on.

The photos do not do this dress justice. i loved it as soon as i tried it on! it is good quality and the fabric is not too thin. definitely recommend!,pos

This is a very flattering blouse. gorgeous detail with the beading!,pos
I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,neg

This sweater runs oversized; very soft and comfortable and colors are spot on for fall. love the sleeve length.,pos

This is the perfect tank for everyday but it looks like you've dressed up a bit. i love the flow and the ruffles and it looks super cute with a pair of skinny pants. really comfortable and it is good quality.,pos
"Ag jeans have become my favorite and these didn't disappoint. ridiculously comfortable! i think they run a tad big, but maybe not enough to size down. just enough to where i'll need to wash them more often, maybe.",pos
"These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended.",pos
"This dress is beautiful on, is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy, it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer, but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.",pos
"This skirt is about an inch longer on me than on the model in photo (i'm 5 ft, ordered petite) but the length actually works. i have a bit of a tummy, so ordered size 4 - fits great. really love the colors - so many tops will go with this skirt, so it will be easy to vary the look.",pos
"Love it! i usually wear a small but i just went to our local store and they only had a medium. i tried it on just in case and it fit perfectly. it is sitting pretty in my closet now. :) so if you are a size small, try ordering a medium and i hope it works for you as well.",pos
"I love this dress! i'm 5'5"", and it's just long enough to be dramatic and graze my feet without dragging on the ground with flat sandals. the print is lovely and the beading is subtle. as some have mentioned, the neck is high. it's definitely noticeable, but i didn't find it uncomfortable.",pos
I can't wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out. love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel. i especially love the detail at the pocket edges. very well made. the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable. this will go great with denim and long skirts. the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but that's okay. this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet. most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so it's nice to be able to wear a bit of,pos

This cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so it's a win-win! it hangs a little boxy so i'll need to figure out how to style it so it's more flattering. the pockets are a pretty gold color (you can see it from the inside) and adds a nice touch of color. it's a keeper!,pos

Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things :) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!,pos

I have been looking for a skirt like this and love this one. it does sit a little high on your waist but i like that and think it's more flattering (at least on me it is). i marked that it runs try to size but may run a tiny bit on the larger size. i usually wear a 4 but a 2 fit great and it's been a long time since i've worn a 2!,pos
This top looks fantastic on. definitly great when you want to look a little more dressed up! the fabric is a bit sheer so i will wear a nude camisole underneath. the design has the perfect amount of shimmer to make it dressy. it is so silky and feels great on! the neckline has the perfect plunge too.,pos

I was on a mission at retailer to find a versatile and comfortable jacket/cardigan. this is perfection. the detail and pattern in the wool make it unique and the zipper and snaps are great quality. i bought it in the green and is great for the office and out in jeans as well.,pos
"I love clothing that has little surprises, and i love the detailing at the arms with the lace-like openings which is not very characteristic (and actually quite fancy) for a typical henley. i found the fabric to be medium weight-and thought the quality was fine. i like all of the colors this comes in-each would fit into my wardrobe nicely. i have gotten into comfortable clothing (that is still flattering and functional) lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it. this top certainly is",pos

"I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty, but too stiff a hand to drape well.",neg

"I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights, but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday, and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink, but from an arm's length away or more, it looks beige wi",pos
"Thanks to the previous reviewer who noted the details and size of the blouse, i purchased this blouse. it's true to size, size small fit me perfectly (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), and it even fit my muscular arms and broad shoulders perfectly. the color is very rich, a wine color. some of the jars of jam have berries on it, and of course, the tassels have spoons at the end. the neckline is so perfect, feminine yet appropriate for work. how cute is that? it is a silky material and flows perfectly",pos
"This robe is so pretty, i kind of feel like a movie star when i wear it! the embroidered flowers and trim are a very nice touch. the fabric is very light and soft, i'm sure it will feel nice and cool on those hot summer nights ahead. the fit is true to size and is actually a bit longer than what is shown on the model. i am extremely happy i decided to make this purchase.",pos
"I was on the fence about another patchwork design peasant inspired blouse, but once i tried this on i fell in love. it drapes beautifullly, is not too short, and just feels pretty. for reference i am 5 feet 6 inches, 140 lbs. 36b and usually wear a medium in tops. the medium fits and flows perfectly, hiding all my mature woman problem areas.
i purchased quite a few items on the 40% off sale, and this is one of my top favorites. i love the versatility, just gorgeous for casual wear or dressy.",pos
"Just bought this dress in a 6. i'm 5'7"" 138 lbs (32b, 29 in jeans). this is *so* much better than pictured. it's an empire waist that really flatters my small bust and accentuates the thin part of the waist. i have an hourglass figure, but can see this working great for pear shapes. i wish the material felt softer, but the fit was so perfect, even for my broad shoulders. will transition nicely to warmer weather, but for now, i plan to wear it with leggings and a cardigan.",pos

"Love this striped top! it's perfect to throw on with black skinnies and a denim jacket or long grey cardigan. it also pairs well with camel. it is super soft. runs big imo, even though other reviewers said small. like most bordeaux, i took an xs, whereas i wear a small in most other retailer brands. similar to the photo, although much looser on me.",pos
"I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.",neg

"I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft, drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue, not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little, but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit, yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt, go down a size or look for something else.",pos

"I have long arms and they are not really small and the small fit me well. i think the fact that i have broad shoulders made this top work for me. definitely a keeper! i am surprised that the arms fit me though, because i often experience sleeves that are too tight when trying on tops. i'm glad that wasn't the case this time around. i'm 5'4"" 130-135lbs, depending on my appetite!",pos
"First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress. but the fit is extremely loose. they could take out an entire 12 inches of material and it would still be a swing dress. the photo of the back of the model, where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate. if it was, i would love this dress. the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs - straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline. i am 5'7""",neg
Absolutely wonderful! they fit like a dream. you could dress them up or down. i'll probably live in these jeans forever.,pos
"I wanted to like this top, as the fabric was nice and thick, but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits, which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape, but i've always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy (and i'm not heavy). not great enough to keep in my opinion.",neg
"I am a huge fan of tracy reese because her dresses are works of art, great quality, and super wearable for both work and play, and this is no exception. i purchased this dress in regular xs (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it falls right above my knees. for the office or more conservative setting, i add a belt and a sweater. otherwise, i wear it alone for a carefree look. i chose the regular size because the dress is voluminous and it gets about an inch shorter when i belt it, and it looks",pos
"I loved this top so much that i ended up purchasing it in another color. it works with so many different outfits, both casual and dressy. it is super comfortable and so soft. i would definitely recommend it!",pos
"These pants are nothing short of amazing! they have a great wide leg with plenty of beautiful flow to them. i am 6 months pregnant and can wear them under my bump, but they are by no means maternity pants (i have only gained 8 lbs). they have a nice silky material that will be great for hot summer weather and will be great, comfortable travel pants. the only downfall is the length. i am 5'6"" with long legs and will have to get 2-3 inches chopped off.",pos
"So there weren't any product reviews to go by when i ordered the last small. i had no way of knowing if it ran big, small, or tts. i'm usually a med, but to my surprise the small worked due to the fluid pleating. it sits right on my natural waistline similar to the model and not too short in length (i'm 5'8""). i also like the med weight of the fabric it moves freely when you walk, but not too light. it is similar to a double weight georgette or crepe.",pos
"I've worn this dress to two summer weddings and i couldn't be happier with it. this dress is extremely flattering. i usually wear a size 12, but i returned the dress for a size 10 which fit perfectly. the exact same dress, but in a different color was being sold at another major store. the other color wasn't nearly as flattering (but still cute) and the price was comparable.",pos
"Beautiful shirt, hits me a little higher. i'm not sure i'm going to keep it just because i have something similar but its a beautiful top. i'm 5'6"" and carrying a little extra baby weight right now so i'm an 8-10 instead of my usual 6-8. i ordered an 8 and it fit well.",pos
"I love this top. i am 5'8"", 135, 36d, ordered a small and it fit perfectly. length is long, but i liked it. i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge boots...love this top!",pos
I am so happy i decided to purchase these. they are the only invisible socks i've found that actually stay on my feet. all others always slip off my heel... these are great!,pos
"I loved this at first sight, and ordered it in a 10, 12, and 14 to make sure i'd get one that fit me. (i ended up with the 12). i wear a 32 dd bra, so usually braless is not an option, but this actually offers enough support. and, if i do want to wear a bra it's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it. 

it's super flattering, and really fun to wear out day or night.",pos
"I ordered this in the ""chocolate"" color which is really a pinkish/taupe-brown. but i love the color; it's neutral yet not too pale, just the right hue to go with almost any color and the style works with any outfit, from jean shorts to a dress. i love how soft the knit is. although i worry it might be prone to snag, especially the open-weave sections. i also love that the sleeves are full length, fitted enough to be pushed up on my forearms yet i can pull them down past my wrists when i am chill",pos
I found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit. the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction.,pos
Very pretty top! the fabric is super soft. i ended up sizing up from my regular xs to a s because the chest area was just a bit snug.,pos
"I just received the acacia swing tank and when i pulled it out, i felt like it was christmas day all over. it hangs nicely and felt luxurious on my skin. even my husband was dazzled. the detailing of the flowers is delicate and feminine. the cutaway gives you a sexy, casual chic appearance that you can dress up or down. i can't wait to unveil this new piece at work.",pos
"I love the cut of this shirt! interesting back, and it hangs nicely.....surprisingly flattering! i'm usually a small and needed the xs in this shirt, fyi. very soft, and overall just very pleased with this purchase! i bought it in the denim as well!",pos
"So soft, light and warm! will work as an outer layer or fit under a coat. the wine is beautiful, with a subtle two-tone contrast between the outside and slightly brighter inside, even though it's just one layer. relaxed and casual yet will dress up a tee or blouse.

i'm usually m or even l but the m was too droopy at the shoulders so went for the s, which looks less slouchy and more jacket-y on.",pos
"I was looking for cute comfy stylish tees and was ecstatic when i came across this one. i purchased the coral and i love it! it's adorable on, i'm going to purchase another color. so happy!",pos
"I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it, but i could not. there were spots missing sequence, some fell off as i tried the dress on, and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly, for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes.",neg
This tee is amazing. it's light weight and perfect for the summer heat. the detail of the cross and tie back is perfect to elevate the style. this is going to be a solid staple in my tee collection. i wish it came in other colors because i would buy them all.,pos
My new favorite socks! has a grip and doesn't slip off like some of my other liner socks have because this one covers more of your feet. perfect for my low boots.,pos
Very pretty and a nice fit. lighter weight than i expected at this price but as long as it holds up i'll be happy.,pos
"Bought this for my daughter who is graduating this year. looks much better in person then it does in the photo. she is 5'7"" and 135lb. we bought the size four. great length on her. green adds a nice pop of color. she loves it.",pos
"Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?",neg
"This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique, adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work, party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it.",pos
"This skirt is much more vivid in person, which i like. the fit though was off for me. i ordered my usual size medium. i wear a 6 or 8 in bottoms. the medium was fitted!! you could see every curve. definitely not comfortable with that! i would probably have a better fit with a size up, however, i am not a fan of the gray lining that you can see on the inner back portion of skirt... so i think i will pass on this one.",pos
This is beautiful dress with great fit. i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size. the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel.,pos
"This blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully. i don't think it's too wide at all. it's soft and comfortable. it's stretchy, yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape. definitely a classic piece. the sale price makes the cost more appropriate. the white is a little transparent, but with a tank, it's not a problem. the black is beautiful. i'm having a hard time choosing between them. i love the cut and sleeve details. it wouldn't have looked right with less fabric. it's needed for the sty",pos
"This dress did not show well on the hanger but thankfully it intrigued me. i love it, it's very flattering and easily dressed up for work with a heel or dressed down for the weekend. great buy!",pos
This is a great everyday top that is very versatile.,pos
I love this sweater. comfortable and flattering. great for going out causal and staying warm!,pos
Love the way this tee looks and feels. so comfortable and fun! good length. perfect jeans tee.,pos
The shirts fits well. it is very soft and stretchy but thick enough that it's not see through. the collar is the best part. i wear small and i'm 5'3.,pos
"I saw this peasant blouse online and thought it looked cute, but not really enough to spend the money on. i purchased a few other things instead. i happened to go into the store to see a different top in person and spotted this one. it is definitely cuter in person. as with most tops like this, it is baggy and loose. however, probably due to the elastic at the bottom, this one doesn't look overly big and shapeless. just a pretty top that will be perfect for spring. for reference, i am 5'6 115, a",pos
"The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length, style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants, i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!",pos
"I wanted to love this shirt, but was very disappointed. i had read other reviews and still ordered, but wish i would have listened. the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering. had to send it back.",neg
"Really pretty color, light, breathable fabric and i love the high neck on this tunic! i wear this tunic with black leggings, a black tank and black sandals. i'm not the smallest girl so i love that this tunic is a bit longer and has a bit of a belt. wonderful pick up!",pos
"I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod",neg
"I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also, i'm busty, 34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!",pos
"This is the cutest sweater. i bought it today in black. i cannot wait to wear it. it is a lovely, distinctive knit & just the right weight to layer as shown with a white blouse or with a turtleneck. i tried both the xs and s; and i decided to go with the s as it still emphasized that i have waist, but i could layer it nicely. i am 5'4"", 130 lb. you can always count on angel of the north for great style.",pos
Just received these pants today and i absolutely love them! the material is super soft and the fit is true to size! i ordered the tan color. i really like the wide leg and the frayed bottom!! i may order the gray too!,pos
"Finally a dress that ticks all the right boxes: mostly natural fibers, lovely details, fantastic pattern placement, and an easy fit that doesn't require alterations. 
.
the dark blue cotton is similar to my embroidered floreat 'sunless skies shift' from around 2008 which looks like new after so many years (but required alterations even in petite).

i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 (30d/32c bra). the size 0 regular fit me and ended just below my knees. a bit low cut, and a tiny bit below my nat",pos
"This top is beautiful on, it has very feminine detail and is very flattering. the first time i wore it i got 4 compliments on it. i would definitely recommend!",pos
"This is a very comfortable bralette- the silk covers one's most sensitive parts, so it feels like you are wearing almost nothing. it's very pretty, too. i wear a 34b bra and the small fits me. it doesn't have a lot of support, but it's very comfortable for wearing at home or on errands. the cups are a little far apart, but it still works. if you're looking for something pretty and comfortable for casual wear, i would recommend this at the sale price.",pos
"Great basic tee with just the right amount of extra detail. the length is perfect--not too long, not too short. fit is relaxed and comfortable without looking sloppy. i'm coming back for more colors!",pos
"I usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me. sadly, this dress is a definite exception, which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress. as other reviewers stated, the dress does run small, but even if you size up, if you have any breasts at all, the dress will pull at the buttons, causing them to gape (i'm only a b cup, so not on the large side.) i'm pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture. i love",neg
"This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture. it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room, so i tried it on on a whim and loved it! so, so soft too! runs true to size. i am 5'2 and 125 and got a small.",pos
"I ordered the black 2 months ago, it was on back order, and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft, itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the ""v"" in front where it crosses is low, so most people do need a cami underneath, but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style, but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts, deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color, not sure, but love this one in black for sure@",pos
"Loved the red and white stripes and soft fabric, lays nicely has a nice cut. pairs well with jeans and a cute casual jacket or dress it up. nice quality and color!",pos
"As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality, well fitting leggings that do not slide down, shift around, or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i don't want, nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep",pos
"The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5""there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots, flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined, but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets.",pos
"So cute, so comfortable, so pretty - so i guess i love everything about it. it is not too short on me and i think you can wear it in many ways... thought of adding a vest - thought of boots - can't wait to wear it. i agree the material is substantial so it isn't flimsy for fall or winter. happy with this purchase. runs true to size. i went with the op. i sometimes chose regular length, but this one is just right in the petite. i have long arms but these sleeves are just right. i am 5 ft. tall, b",pos
This top is gorgeous! the print is lovely and the material and cut are well constructed. can't wait to wear!,pos
"This dress is really cute, it's not a complete bag on you. i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is see-through. and that is the case, but i own multiple pairs of skin-toned underwear and did not find this to be a problem. the fabric is lightweight, but perfect for the summer. it does wrinkle, but a steamer is your best friend.",pos
"Quality is great, fit is great, and the message keeps me in a good mood and motivated throughout the day :)

i got it in a size 2 (i am usually a s-m in retailer tops) and it fits great (for reference 5'4"" 140lbs, 37-29-39).

i usually don't wear grey but the bright colored font led me to make an exception.

very happy with the purchase!",pos
"This is a beautiful dress. it's a great weight, unique pattern, and has gorgeous colors. it's fairly forgiving because of the heavy fabric but may run small on bottom. i am a 10 or 12 in pants, 10 dress right now and i bought the 12. i am 5'8"" and 175 lbs, and 36c - also in the last stretch of a weight loss journey so if that helps anyone choose sizing... also i have to buy long or tall pants and this dress was not too short and did not show my smooth wear underneath. i love it and bought it at",pos
"This is that one special, whimsical beauty that you hope to open on christmas morning. super comfy, not at all itchy and the pattern and colors are super stunning. even more vivid in person. i've never seen anything quite like it! very eye catching and oozing for compliments. can be dressed up or down, quite easily. very warm, and surprisingly true to size, even with the m/l combo. i'd say definitely worth the price..it is expensive, but this heirloom worthy piece is worth the splurge.",pos
Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top! very comfortable and stylish. you can wear it either off the shoulder or not!,pos
"Great quality and cut! they are so versatile, which i love! highly recommend these!",pos
"Light and delicate and certainly not a color i would usually pick for myself but at sale price this was a lucky steal for me! if i had known how much i would love this dress i would've paid full price. as for sizing, i am top heavy but picked the smaller end of my size range instead of my usual. the slip is just about tts and the silk outer is larger and flowy. for fit reference: 5'3"", 36dd, 140#, barrel chested, large upper arms and i purchased size 8.",pos
I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it's highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special.,pos
The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.,pos
Agree with other reviewers the jacket is better in person than on model very nice jacket model does it no justice,pos
"I almost never buy anything full price here and usually wait patiently for a sale + promotion :) however, this really struck me and i decided to buy it, telling myself it's an investment piece for years to come. it's just so unique and beautiful -- the things that makes retailer unique that aren't as common anymore.

pros:
- very comfortable. i was skeptical because it's all polyester, but it's light and thin and breathable. it feels wonderful on the skin. the lining inside is ver",pos
"From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.",neg
"I walked into retailer today to buy 2 dishes for a registry. $$$ later i walked out with this dress (and another, ugh). it is so beautiful in person. it ever-so-slightly flares out and it definitely has that 70s feel. i got it in white and plan on wearing it for my rehearsal dinner with tan platforms and a flower crown. for reference: 5'7/got some hips and thighs/148lbs - and i got a medium. would have gotten the small but it was slightly shorter.",pos
"Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far, but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?",neg
"I'm so glad i found this gem in the store, as the online pic does this shirt no justice!  the green version is vibrant and adorable, and this shirt is lightweight, without being see-through.  for sizing reference: i'm 5'4"", 135 lbs, 34c and a size 6 petite.  i tried this in the store in a size 4 and an 8 (only sizes they had) and rushed home to order it online in a 6.  perfect fit, so i believe its true to size.  the little details...the buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner!",pos
This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i've ever ordered from retailer. it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving. it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all. there are also weird stitching lines. one more thing that i didn't like about the skirt was that it's a cream-ish color. not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt. it's going back.,neg
I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well. this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty. it's cotton.,pos
Frumpy - looked like a nightgown on me; maybe  better on someone younger ...,neg
"Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small, medium and large on and huge huge huge, boxy, fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it's way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing.",neg
"This top is drop-dead adorable, very well made, and a flattering fit. i noticed other reviewers saying it is wide and short, but that was not my experience. it's a slight ""swing"" or ""trapeze"" shape, but fitted through the shoulders. so, if you are small-shouldered and small in the chest - this is a very, very cute top. for reference, i am 5'4"" and a 32c - and i took a size 2. perfect when paired with dark skinnies or capris. it's also delightfully well made with excellent detailing - the cute vi",pos
"These pants were pretty different then my typical style, but i love them! they come down a bit longer then i think they are supposed to because i have shorter legs, but i still think they are cute- especially with a heel or clog. good quality, well made.",pos
"I bought this dress on a whim one day, even though i wasn't sure where i would wear it, but i just had to have it. this dress fits beautifully, and is very flattering. i am 5'9 and typically a size 14 with large hips, behind, and a smaller waist. the 12 fit me very well--snugged in all the right places and just right everywhere else. i ended up wearing this to a benefit and i received many compliments. go for it!",pos
"I initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out. the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band. it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater. the fabric is very soft. the only downside i see, is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath. though i think that will change over time as i wear it more. it wasn't a huge inconvenience, which is why i still give this 5 stars. i am always a small at retailer, which is what i ordered, so",pos
"I really like this dress. despite the somewhat gathered skirt, it has a clean line and doesn't add a lot of volume around the hips. the blue is a great color. the length is well above the knee but i'm 5'10"". i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots.",pos
I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.,pos
"I am absolutely addicted to tunics. so, when i saw this on sale, with an extra 30% off, i went for it. i'm glad i did! it's absolutely beautiful. i love the opposing stripe patterns, the hi-lo feature (very subtle), and the tie back. so cute!

if you're petite like me, though, you may want to wear something underneath--it does cut a bit low in the chest area.",pos
"Love the lace cut out detail on the sleeves which is initially what attracted me to this sweater. just be careful with the threads. the sleeves are long but are supposed to be, as in the photo. comfortable material with nice weave, flattering cut. i bought the ivory color in xs for my 5'2"" 115 # straight frame. not too long",pos

"If you're pregnant, congratulations. this shirt is for you. if you've ever dreamed of being an xxs, this shirt is also for you. i'm a 34d, normally a small or medium, but often size down to xs in swing tops. the xs is ginormous on me, although it fits through the shoulders. i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides, it's that wide. think flying squirrel. what doesn't show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve, which makes it look wide at the to",neg

Gorgeous cobalt blue color!!!  usually s/m- bought the small (because of larger armholes).  so glad i snatched this one up on sale!  the detail on the top is amazing.,pos
"I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top. while they are the same price, they aren't even close in quality. this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen. the trim, pocket and the lace-up tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didn't lay right, and the tag sewn inside, was sewn with red thread and showed through, very visible. i don' t think it would hold up after many washes. i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev",neg
When these cords went on sale i bought a 2nd pair. they are great work week pants (i teach) - comfortable and machine washable. the fit is relaxed-trouser,pos
I almost never buy full price but i did with this skirt.  it is adorable! saw it in the store.  it is too short to wear to work but is fine for casual wear.  i am a size 14 but the largest one they had was a 12 and it fit perfectly.  i&#39;d size down. the fabric is stiff and the a-line stands out.  colors are southwesternish.  can be worn with any color top.  i bought a cream colored top to wear with it (that was on the sale rack) but i'm sure there are plenty things in the closet that will go.,pos
"I'm curvy, and i often have trouble finding pants that don't have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome, especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips, so if you're trying to hide hips, these aren't for you. i love them, though--they drape beautifully and feel great.",pos
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size. post pregnancy i am a 6 on top and an 8 on the bottom. ordered a 6 and it is perfect. (140 lbs and 34c) perhaps that's because i'm long waisted and the waistline hits right below my rib cage?

the colors, materials and quality are wonderful. i can see wearing this in the winter and summer. in fact, it will look lovely against sun kissed skin.

one thing, the top portion appeared to be a knit in the pictures online, howeve",pos
"I saw this in my local store last night and was instantly drawn to the color. it is more greenish than yellow. i say this alot but this was so much prettier in person. i would not look twice at it online- the picture does it no justice. i am not a pancho person, but this looks very luxurious and expensive and it feels so soft and warm. i tried the xs/s and it fit perfect - i am typically a medium in other brands at antrho. it is boxy, but that is the point of a sweater of this type. it will be p",pos

As always these pilcro pants did not disappoint. i can always order a size 26 and know they will fit like a custom pant. i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model. there is no crotch hang like in the photo. i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming.,pos
I love the navy blue color. they are a fun alternative to skinny jeans. the fit is great and they are super comfortable!,pos
"I ordered this on a whim during the 40% discount upon sale price. i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially, but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper. its quite soft and is flattering. i usually wear a medium, got the m/l and fits well.",pos

Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.,pos

I love this! i agree with previous post that say  it is much better in person. the fabric is high quality but not too thick. i bought this to have something light to wear on a trip to italy and it will be perfect. the color is so lovely and the flowy detail at the hem makes it unique. it's a basic without being basic. i'm so glad i added it to my wardrobe.,pos
"I've been looking for a mid-weight, shrug-on cardigan for a while now and i've finally found the one! as a petite (5'4"", 130 lbs) lady with big boobs, i hate clingy cardigans with buttons since they are just so unflattering. 

luckily this cardigan is warm without being stifling, fitted in the sleeve without being impossible to wear over clothes with different-length sleeves, and perfectly cut to slim even thought it is shrug-y. i especially like the back details, which are even more curve-fla",pos
"I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange"", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit.",pos
"Runs small. i'm usually a size sm for retailer clothing (for reference, i'm 5'4, 129lbs, 36b). the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist. i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size 8. the size 10 fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large. pretty, vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes.",neg
"Great top! i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s. i ordered the white to start with and decided to go back for the other 2 colors. it's a great basic to wear with pants/shorts/skirts, but the side slit and slant set it apart from a regular tank. i opted for the small in this top just because of where the side slit hit.",pos

I'm an employee and bought this top today. i'm so happy i ended up buying it on a whim! it's adorable and super comfy! it's perfect for those jeans and a tee day! i can't wait to wear it to work. the color is gorgeous and the peplum adds a feminine detail without being too puffy...in love!,pos
Love the dress but ended up returning it as i'm not sure how often i would wear it. the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress!!!,pos

"I loved the look of this top online - it had great lines. i was so disappointed when i received it.  it has zero support/lining and i'm not large chested to need a lot. it's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it, making it even harder to get off. it was returned.",neg

"The photos on the website do not do the dress justice. i am into texture, pattern and contrasting fabrics, this dress is gorgeous in person; not only has pattern, but the pattern is woven, so there is this wonderful texture as well that i had to try. some of the reviews said the dress runs large, others that this is a bodycon dress. i ordered a size 8 and my usual 10. both were figure hugging but the size 10 allowed this to be office wear while still being flattering. i am fairly straight, small",pos

This dress is really lovely. it looks so fragile online but in person is rather structured and substantial. it runs very large i just returned mine for 2 sizes down. i also like the zipper up the back so that the eye hooks on the front are not necessary to use to put on. the interior lining is affixed so there is no slipping like a typical under slip. if you are on the fence at least try it. i am glad i did.,pos

"With all the white dresses to choose from this year, this was the one i settled on. it is comfortable, the quality is good, especially in the edge detail, it's machine washable (which is a must for me and white), and it is easy to dress up or down. i am 5'7"", 125lbs and found my usual size small to fit tts - it is loose fit like the model shot. easy throw on and go dress with cute details to boot :)",pos
"Once i tried this dress on i understood why the pricepoint was so high! it's very thick ( but not uncomfortable) and very well made. love the color and style of this dress, but as others have said, the model picture is deceiving. try it on in store to see if you like it for yourself! i'm curvy on top and bottom with broad shoulders and personally it was a no for me, i found other dresses that i loved more, this one was pretty but wasn't a hit for me.",pos

"This dress can be dressed up or down. it looks cute w/ a black open sweater and looks great alone. the fabric is very soft. although it isn't fitted, it doesn't have too much material either, so it is very flattering on. the back yoke also has the white embroidered flowers which finishes off a quality look. the pockets are nice and light inside. i usually wear a 10/12 and the large fit perfectly. i was also lucky to get it on sale ;)",pos
I love love love this dress for everyday running around or you can dress it up with jewelry or a scarf. so boho and so comfortable. buying the other color now.,pos

"Every now and then a piece like this one comes along at retailer, and i quickly make the purchase without any regret.
without being stuffy or old, this top is simply elegant. the floral is very high-end designer (think italian made) for a fraction of the cost. made of 100% bamboo, it is light without being sheer. there is no need for a cami with this one. the fabric has the body of a good linen, but it doesn't wrinkle nearly as much. it does require dry cleaning, though, if this matters to you.",pos
"I thought the design of this dress was distinctive, and it did not let me down. there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on, but i wouldn't sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony. i'm 5'5' and i got the petite which hit me about 2 inches above my knee. material is like jeans and consequently not see-through at all. even though it is quite expensive, there is something special about the dress.",pos
Love the tegan tunic version of this dress. i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong. this runs so big! i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on. i highly recommend ordering at least 2 sizes down unless you want to look tent-y.,neg
This top is just a beautiful as in the picture. it runs true to size and has a beautiful flattering shape on. it looks great with jeans and sandals for a casual look but can easily be dresss up too. i'm 5'3 so sometimes i need petite sizing but i liked the length of the regular fit with this top. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.,pos

These shorts were beautiful!! love the material and the way they fit. the drawstring makes them very adjustable.,pos
"The dress is just perfect. it's fits true to size and the colors are as pictured. also, a bonus, it travels well - despite having so many pleats it folds nicely and can be worn right out of the bag. very happy i got it while on sale.",pos
I love layering this over basic tees (or graphic ones like the wild west tee) - it adds just the right amount of edge. currently building my pin collection to add on (vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact).,pos
"Maybe it's my curves or the way i'm only 5'4"" but this was a hot mess on me! it is soooo long and cut to low for my 36d chest. it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but! it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather. if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs, go for it! had to send back!",neg
This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.,neg

I love this sweater. i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure. i'm curvy on bottom w/ a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i don't want to look like i'm wearing a moo-moo. this top looks chic. it's the right shape to flow gently. it's just the right detail to be different in an understated way. i wear it w/ leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt. neckline is good-- i'm a 34b and it's flattering. not sure if it will fla,pos

"I really like this top, it is form fitting and i think true to size that i would normally wear. i do not think the v-neck is too low so that i would feel comfortable wearing this even to work. i was surprised at how thick the fabric was, but i am typically cold so i like this feature. the criss-cross design in the front and back of this garment is very flattering and i get a lot of compliments whenever i wear this piece.",pos
"Fit is perfect! very flattering. they are very long, so i will need to shorten.",pos
"I had been looking for something like this to add to my summer wardrobe. fortunately for me i saw these in the retailer catalog and thought, how perfect, exactly what i've been searching for. they are a bit pricey, and crotch hangs a bit lower on me because i'm only 5'3, but it's not enough to make me send them back, i will have them altered if need be, they are to cute. 

i'm a size 4 in pants and ordered the 29, i wanted some wiggle room, i didn't realize the denim has stretch, i will keep the",pos
"I am 5'1"", 32-26-36 and 115 lbs and got the xsp in the neutral motif at a great price. shipping was quick as well (2 business days). the dotted swirly lines are more beige than they appear on the model. great shape and easy jersey silhouette that will be flattering on all body shapes! will look great with a long statement necklace.",pos
"Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5'3""). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :)",pos
"This sweater is the reason i shop at retailer - unique, cute & comfy! the yellow really isn't 'one of my colors' but it's so different that i had to get it. and the cut is so flattering, that i had to go back to get the purple! it may run a tad bit generously; i'm 5'4"", 124 lbs, 34d and originally got the small. i wound up returning and getting the xs. that sizing was slightly more form-fitting, without being clingy.we had a hint of fall weather in colorado, so i immediately threw the yellow versi",pos
"I ordered this in size xl. it fits true to size. it does have a boat neckline which runs a little tight on me. but, everything else feels comfortable. i know this isn't a flattering style. horizontal stripes on my plus-sized, pear-shape isn't my favorite. but, i love the back. the knot isn't very comfortable to lean against. i just love the lace in the back that i wear it when running short errands where i don't have to lean back a lot. it does need a tank underneath or it's see-through in the b",pos
"This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!",neg
"Did not even know this is available in petite! as someone who is at 5' exaggerated, there regular size xs/s fits nicely. great find. goes well with leggings or jeans. this will be a wardrobe staple for quite a while.",pos
Looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look.  i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly.  the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium.,pos
This tank is super soft and very well fitted. it fits true to size. the lace is so pretty in front but what makes this unique is the lace on the back of the top. it is a unique design and good quality!,pos
"I saw these shorts while leaving the store and immediately went back to the register to add them to my wardrobe. they fit me true to other cartionnier clothing. i'm 5'7"" 126 lbs and took a size 6. there is a significant amount of stretch in them, but do not grow as the day goes on. the colors are bright and fun without looking juvenile.",pos
"Got the petite size. dress is swing style, so extra fabric is expected. can wear a nude bra or strapless. dress is beautiful in person, more so than online. very comfy and stands out without being flashy, just pretty and different. nice silk (matte, not shiny).",pos
"I loved the style of this shirt so much that i bought two of them. unfortunately after washing the turquoise one, it sprang several holes. the same thing happened to the second one after one wash! i purchased several of these shirts in the tank style over this past summer, and they have washed and worn great. i think the fabric quality and craftsmanship has gone way downhill at retailer lately. very disappointed.",neg
"Fabric is soft,cool and comfortable. love the sleeves as air circulates. this is perfect for new wide legs i purchased. many compliments and purchase inquiry when worn. purchased in two colors.",pos
"I loved the fact that this dress is cotton. it is a thin cotton, and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap. mine came with a nude slip. i'm thinking they all come with a nude slip. i'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is. the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine won't tear easily or to retur",neg
"I love this skirt!! it slips seamlessly from day to night, and looks great on those of us who happen to be on the taller side. it's super warm, so it's perfect with tights and boots on those colder winter evenings out.",pos
"I love this shirt! the colors are more muted in the photos, so i was a little surprised to see how bright some of the colors were. still super cute! also has a looser fit--i'm a small across brands (5'7"", 130, straight/slender build), so if you prefer a more true or tighter fit, size down. either way, get this!!!!",pos
"Love this dress. it's a nice addition to my summer wardrobe. easy to wear. i am between a large and an ex large in dresses. i did order it in a large, it was a perfect fit but did exchange it for an ex large. i wanted it to have little more swing to it.",pos

"I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 
1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.
2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.
3. in the picture, t",neg
"Love love love this dress! the fit is amazing and is slimming. although the lace is delicate looking, it wears well.",pos
"Absolutely love this jumpsuit. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits perfectly (i am typically an xs/00). when i read previous reviews i was quite excited to read that most people found it to be ""short waisted""-- the waist band actually hits my natural waist (just how it is pictured on the model), which never happens! great quality, thick fabric and the pleats in the front are beautiful. can't wait to wear it!",pos
"This is the perfect little throw-on dress. flattering, uber-comfortable, nice fabric. i found that it runs slightly large.",pos
"Looks better in person than the pictures online. very soft and comfortable. if you are between sizes, size down. it is roomy with a lot of material that drapes in the front. just know that this sweater is short in the back and does not cover your backside.",pos
"I bought this in coral, it is soft and the fit is flattering. the perfect top for transitioning into fall here in the desert.",pos
"I finally found this dress in store today and wow! i cannot believe this cheap looking dress is from ms! they have been among the top at retailer and this unlined, baggy, cheap velvet sub is a shock! what happened? only the color is nice. please get back to yourself ms!",neg
I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.,pos
I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.,pos
"I bought this sweater/coat as a gift for my mother. she absolutely loves.it. it does seem to run a little large, and the sleeves are especially long. the navy and grey color combo is very nice. it seems like it will be very warm too.",pos
I love everything about this top! the fit and style are beautiful and the fabric high quality. it does run about a half size large (i'm usually a size 4 and needed an xs in this top). this is so versatile--i have worn it with a tangerine midi skirt and denim shorts and it looks great however i pair it. i highly recommend this!,pos
Adorable print! just picked these up in the store yesterday! the print is so pretty and it caught my eye! surprisingly they fit in my usual size for workout pants!,pos
"I ordered this dress with the 25% off everything code as it is a bit expensive. i will say it is well worth the price. from the material, to the design, and fit, i was truly pleased. i am usually a 4p in retailer dresses so i went with the xs-p and it fits perfectly. it is super cute and unique, and i love, love, love the pockets, which is always an added bonus. it is so fun and flattering, as i am sure people will be asking where this one is from. a definite summer must have. obsessed with this w",pos
"I almost missed this, i snagged it during the black friday sale online. i got an extra small and it fits great-not too fitted. the back is a cotton material with some stretch to it. the embroidery is beautiful.",pos
"It's soft and not itchy at all (itchy sweater is my all time nightmare). the design makes you feel like a snow princess. i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",pos
"This dress is gourgeous, will be able to wear year round.
just add a cardigan or blazer.
the only fault i find in it is the waist band is a bit wide.
however i have a hour glass shape, so my waist is very small",pos
"This top is beautiful, really special. i am a 32dd and this type of flowy top sometimes doesn't work for me but this one is fine. looks great with skinny jeans and boots or flats.",pos
"This didn't work for me. im normally a m (8/10). got this in xs. that was the correct size for me, i believe. however, the armholes were huge. husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it. but, i sent it back.",neg
"This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.

*highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.",pos
"I knew when i bought this bralette that there was something special about it...the intricacy of the design is really pretty as is the style...but seriously - every single time i wear this bralette out (paired with a cute top or dress) i get tons of compliments from all of my friends. i never thought a bralette would spark so much conversation! aside from that it is super durable...i've had it for a year now, have washed it several times, and it is not stretched out at all or frayed aka it is gre",pos
"Love this gorgeous fox skirt. i typically wear either a size 4 or 6 depending on cut. i bought the small and it fit perfectly. i wore it with a black turtleneck sweater and black tights/boots. other colored tops would work, as well, due to the various flower colors around the fox - pink, yellow, blue, white or brick red. i'd prefer it to be a little warmer/lined.",pos
"I got the orange dress and find it super comfortable and flattering. i dress it up with a one-inch taupe belt and taupe wedge shoes. it moves beautifully, i can wear a regular bra and it doesn't show. i got an xs regular and the hemline hits 6"" above my ankles. i'm 5' 3"", 33-26-35 and normally take a size 2 or 0. i'm long waisted, so often a petite will be short-waisted on me. the seam actually comes just below the bust line on me, unlike on the model. on days when i'm a bit bloated, i can wear",pos
"These fit quite well, and it's rare that i find shorts that fit well without being too tight. great for spring or summer. fits tts.",pos
"I picked this up unexpectedly and whisked it into the dressing room a long with a handful of other things today.
i noticed right away how soft it was! so comfy! i have never owned a romper before so i wasn't expecting to like it--- i was so wrong, i'm sorry romper! i love you!
i plan on debuting this little number with a cropped cream cardigan jacket and taupe booties and some layered necklaces for my brother in law's casual weddingrehearsal dinner. 
living in las vegas though, i can definite",pos
This reminds me of the 1970's. the fabric is soft and it looks just like the picture. i'm ordering it in line in a petite. my store doesn't carry petites. it's typical moth quality and fit. perfect.,pos
"Although i love the soft feel of the sweater, the zig zag design was very unflattering. also, the length is much shorter than appears in the picture. i will be returning it.",neg
"Not what i was expecting, but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser, but these are closer to leggings, albeit very substantial ones with ""real pant"" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting, soft yet supportive, stretchy, incredibly comfortable, and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31), and the 10's near perfect, with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available.",pos
