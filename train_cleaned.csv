1,I loved this dress i kept putting it on trying to figure out how to get my boobs to not fall out all over the place this is not a dress for larger breasts it is absolutely beautiful otherwise,1
2,I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors the fabric is thicker than a tshirt these will go with so many thingsjeans to dressy skirts i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium the small fit me but was a little too short for reference i am these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round love,1
3,This picture does not due this sweater justice at all i purchased this today for summer its beyond cute and the colors are awesome its a very light sweater with a fitted but not too tight light feel the sleeves are a little longer than quarter length at least on me it looks amazing with white pants very fresh,1
4,I am a size size and my figure is appleish i cant pull off peplum tops because they are too tight for my shape and they flare out at an unflattering spot all of those rules go out the window with this tankinifirst swimsuits are supposed to be tight so that problem is eliminated right awaysecond the flareout is perfect for women that want to hide their tummies i dont like how swimsuits are generally tight in the tummy thats the area that id like to hide t,1
5,I cant wait for the milder weather to arrive so i can wear this tunic it is very stylish and elegant and one of those rare pieces that makes you feel good wearing it,1

8,Unlike the first three reviews i loved this sweater the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable fits trus to size,1
9,Soft comfortable stylish i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time very versatile,1
10,Im lbs size was best ordered the green color great flattering fit,1
11,I absolutely fell in love with these comfy palazzo pants and imagined that id be wearing them all summer long they fit beautifully were true to size and seemed to go with every top i owned unfortunately on the second wear the inseam completely unraveled leaving a footlong gaping hole in the leg i also noticed some stray threads along the other seams so im not thrilled with the quality it seems like they were poorly manufactured im not sure if i just purchased a faulty pair or if t,0
12,I wanted to love this dress it looks beautiful on the model but it isnt the flattering even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it it it runs pretty big,0
13,I agree with other reviewer the material of these jeans is not the same thin stretches and you end up pulling them up all the time i am a short curvy girl and would love to have the old jean fabric back this seems to be the trend in jeansnydj also uses this fabricstretches too much,0
14,These leggings are beautiful so unusual and colorful comfortable and flattering they fit truetosize with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape the fabric is a bit lighterweight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesnt mind attracting a little envious attention,1
15,I didnt realize how much i would love this wore it to work the other day and got more compliments than i have in a very long time on an outfit its comfortable and easy and flattering bought this totally on a whim and so glad i did,1
16,This looks so gorgeous on the model on the site so i ordered it online it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on looks like i took a floor rug cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head the sweater itself is so pretty its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me i normally wear a small so i ordered the xss and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs its kind of itchy too will be returning this asap,0
17,I loved this top it is beautiful,1
18,The model doesnt do this jumpsuit justice absolutely gorgeous beautifully constructed cute details flows well easy to dress up or down c the was perfect,1
19,This worked for me very elegant cozy and comfortable,1
20,This is the best item i have gotten form retailer the quality is amazing soft covers my butt classic piece,1
21,I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous here are my thoughtspros the jeweled neckline is lovely it really helps set the dress apart pockets such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book the length is ideal for taller folk it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom if youre tall as i am this wont be an issue nicely conservative at the topcons i,1
22,This is the perfect summer dress it can be dressed up or down the quality of the linen fabric is very nice im and it hit right below my knees i found it to run true to size those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size but the tie in the front can be adjusted its lovely,1
23,Ok so this coat is amazing its high quality soft great pattern the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat its been warmer this season so ive worn it as a coat and received many compliments it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat this was purchased on sale w off sale code so for me that was a steal so happy it went on sale give it a try,1
24,These are a comfortable and fashionable pair of shorts they run true to size and look great,1
25,This dress is absolutely beautiful i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price but i just couldnt resist its so flowy and comfortable its quite long on me im and have to wear heels so that it doesnt drag but could easily be fixed with alerations i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments,1
26,This is my new favorite sweater soft and comfortable and easy to wear to both work and play being able to wear different things under this makes it very versatile and easy to change looks,1
27,Better than a regular boring cardigan goes with short sleeves and dresses,1
28,This tunic is just adorable material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color perfect for spring the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touchfit is tts im lbs b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in,1
29,I have never purchased printed pants before but i was so smitten with the cute little shells that i had to try them on i was impressed with the fabric which has some thickness to it but will still be perfect for summer i also have athletic calves and unlike other cartonnier pants ive tried i had no trouble getting these over my legs win win im usually a size and while it was fitted not loose like on the model i know they will stretch being im just on the boarder of having mo,1
30,I got the black in size small i love this easy breezy and comfy t i love that its different and can wear with anything the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like i wish they had more colors i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer im a size and bought a small,1
31,This is a very stylish and unique trench it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets but needed a small for this one i am lbs but with a large chest i think its very flattering i have small hips but the large pockets do not make me look bigger it arrived very wrinkled but i just touched it up with an iron i think the color is more of a taupegray and will go with everything love it,1
32,This is a super cute jumpsuit that is also super comfortable the only thing i wish was different on this jumpsuit is that the pants would go all the way to the ground but it is still super cute and a keeper,1
33,I passed over this dress online thinking id never wear it but then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on i am excited to say that i love this dress it is soft and lovely the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for,1
34,I love coats and have a collection of unique ones and this one is in my top wow is it a stunner totally different and very classy not my every day coat but will be used for dinner outings and special occasions with the right outfit i did reinforce the buttons since there had been many complaints about that which is why i only gave it stars for quality great design on this one retailer,1
35,Absolutely love this piece and lbs and ordered a small fits perfectly this jumpsuit has become a regular in my outfit rotation i get compliments every time i wear it,1
36,Love everything about this sweater i usually wear xs in most retailer tops but had to exchange for a s hope this helps,1
37,I love this dress purchased it in pink and then in the blue color its perfect for any occasion and is very comfortable i feel like it fits true to size and was not to revealing in the front however if i was to wear this to work it would need a cami underneath it is not lined as well love this dress buy it in every color,1
38,Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale,1
39,This dress is beautiful it may run a tad large everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric beautiful design and colors of the print it will go straight into fall so very happy i tried it i have a beautiful elegant dress for the hot weather,1
40,Tla makes the best tees soft feel sophisticated color layering and a body skimming shape all retained after multiple washings versatile too other tees fade stretch out shrink not tla a gem,1
41,This pull over is so easy to wear very comfortable and has a great bohemian vibe its quality seems higher than what i was expecting lots of details tassels fringe and hood i travel a lot for work internationally and its become my goto for the plane dinners and excursions makes a boring outfit looks effortlessly cool would love to see more items like this pullover in the store this fall,1
42,This gorgeous dress arrived today and i cant wait to wear it based on other reviews i ordered a petite even though im because i wanted the skirt to hit just above my knee its perfect i usually wear a or and the p fits well not snug but not big either maybe a r would be larger i dont know if you are worried about the skirt being too long then definitely try a petite size the dress is risqu because its faux see through but still very classy and elegant its sexy w,1
43,I ordered this a little big because the smallest size that they had was a medium i probably could have gone with a small but given that i am a d on top and a size on the bottom lbs the medium fits me just fine it is super soft and you can wear it with just about anything keep in mind that your midriff may show a bit depending on how high your bottoms are however i paired it with a white pair of skinny jeans with a cute belt so a teeny bit of my midriff was showing at time,1
44,Absolutely love these i ordered them in bronze and im thinking about getting the lilac pair as well theyre super comfortable and look great on,1
45,This shirt has it all great staple piece to add to your wardrobe not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down,1
46,This is a great sweater its lightweight and very comfortable i bought a medium but really could use a small medium still worked well though,1
47,This is a cute top but i wore it for around hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower i guess its going to have to wear off thank goodness it was not a hot day i hope that i can return it,0
48,I had high hopes with the other good reviews but you just dont know how amazing this is until you put it on just so soft and cozy i am so excited for more saturdaysunday products at retailer,1
49,I wanted to love this top but it looks like an ambitious year old made it with rumpled fabric and lace found in her grandmothers attic re hopeful but not good the quality is not good and it hangs strangely on sadly it is going back,0
50,thats what i look like wearing this dress a sad sad sack the fabric is less than ideal and there is no shape to speak of i love that it has pockets but thats about it there was just way too much fabric for a petite person this dress has got to be good on someone sadly that person was not me,0
51,Love this dress wore it last night for a musical event came home and put it on the hand wash setting in the washer with cold waterjust as the label states pulled the dress out and guess what the design is completely faded it looks years old so sad im going to call retailer and ask for a refund i live two hours away,0
52,Beautiful neutral color in a comfortable fabric fits tts i am ft in and went with the petite it is a midi on me i have other skirts from retailer from past years in similar fabric and will say that overtime the waist will stretch even if hand washed carefully so that being said buy your size in this skirt dont go bigger to get a longer length you can wear it lower on your hips if you like it longer which i think actually looks more flattering in any case its a great piece that no o,1
53,I bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom absolutely loved it i am so the dress is part is a bit long for meended up wearing my inch heels to make it fit the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures but that makes it more formal its great,1
54,So glad i finally bought this love it and have received many compliments wore it with brown over the knee boots one of my fave all time outfits right now,1
55,This is so much nicer in person wore this out todaynow that it isnt too too cold fashionable and warm love the clasp quite genius i am a c and while id normally take a small got this in medium and it fits perfectly id say this piece runs slightly small for retailer,1
56,Its not a bad concept but i wished for more i wish this tunic was a different material as it was wrinkley and dropwaist design instead of at the waist too bad i wanted to love it but it will go back,0
57,Love this romper fits perfectly and looks like the picture im ft lbs and usually am a size or small i ordered a small and it fits beautifully ive worn this a lot this summer in florida and am getting a lot of compliments dont be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it,1
58,Ordered in my normal size large and i love it beautiful fit striking pattern thats quite slimming the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background it looks black so lots of colors would work on top the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh i like the look but im so it works well,1
59,I bought this dress in blue its a light jersey material but it is lined i find it very flattering i have found more occasions to wear it than i expected,1
60,My new favorite top to throw on,1
61,Ahh its delightful its a little short in the fit but its so cute and didnt cost an absurd amount like some more heavy weight or full trench coats love it,1
62,This would have been a cute top but the shoulder seams come halfway down the arm and give it a really weird shape it looks smooth and fine on the model but in real life they stick out and make you look boxy too bad,0
63,I love this top it is very comfortable and great to throw on with a tank and jeans for the weekend i am curvy and the drape of the top works well on my frame i could see using it as a gym coverup as shown but i like the top too much to get sweat on it,1
64,I love the patterns and the colors easy to dress up or down i ordered a small and just ordered a can to compare them the cut is great as the sides still meet even though theres no closure its a good weight for this weather and winter i live in sweater coats where i am and this is a great additionits a little itchy thats the only flaw,1
65,Love these vegan leather pants the fit is great for my petite frame i bought them in regular size because the petite sold out so fast i just got them hemmed of course i love the fit but i also loved the color the green was a just a little bit different and took me away from the basic black,1
66,Great material that drapes nicely super comfy feels cool but its a thick materialnot at all see through so happy i purchased this and super easy with the snap buttons but the shirt is very well made and highquality material would look great on all sizes and shapes im and about small chest normally im a s or m with tops but bought this in a m because i like a slightly oversized shirt though its also made to be looser and longer still at im not swimming in a m,1
67,This dress is made of a wonderful thick material that is flattering i think the photo doesnt really bring it to life its a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a season dress thanks to the colors the vneck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck,1
68,I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest im petite c ft and purchased the xsp in white it is gorgeous it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp but i like the flowiness of this size i have so im keeping it it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully i love it the material is gorgeous and it is well made,1
69,Every time i turned around received another complement it was perfect for a december wedding great for a holiday party and fit the bill for christmas eve very comfortable and slimming im still amazed at the number of complements received the navy blue lace is elegant and comfortable not scratchy like some lace the v in back of the jumpsuit makes it easy to zip and unzip i have some some imitations and thought i might have a problem zipping up the jumpsuit not a problem absolutely a,1
70,This top is beautiful in design but sadly i will be returning it is hand wash and even after doing so i had unraveled threads resulting in large holes unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing,0
71,I purchased this shirt in the black and it looks great it fits well and the design with the different color dots adds character this shirt can be worn with anything and for just about any occasion thanks retailer for another winner,1
72,I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out and was just released what i love the fit snug not too tight and xs is true to size in the sense of historically the wasit is cinched in ample room in the chest the fabric is substantial thick and sturdy and not prone to wrinkle based on me having it in the bag in the hot car and no false pleats was created the sleeves are fun and different may be a bit much for some it is in multiple pieces why it flutters so nicely,1
73,I almost didnt try this dress i walked by it a few times and am so glad i gave it a try the fit is amazing so flattering the color and material for fall is perfect it looks great with booties and heels,1
74,This dress looked nice online so i ordered it once it arrived i tried it on and it looked even better the fit was flattering as well very versatile piece in an interesting print glad i caught this piece on sale,1
75,These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos but these are far more versatile i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens but the stet chino can be dressed up or down they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful im lbs and i took my usual size in these i have full thighs and i didnt find these to be too tight in the legs at all but i only tried on the blackcharcoal,1
76,Im taller so its not uncommon for things to be too short on me but this was really short for the style it was very wide and loose all over in my usual size both up top and in the wavy part below the style really just did not work with the length it looked very odd,0
77,I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket darker color of denim with weathered edges i absolutely love it dont let it get away great jean jackets are hard to come by,1
78,I love the perfect length of these i am and i love subtle capris which are very hard to find unless i tailor them of course but these are the perfect length and the color is great i have worn them twice and was stopped over and over again by people asking who made them new favorite the waist runs a little tight but legs and tush are true to size,1
79,Not a coat by any means merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isnt pretty enough for a spring coatsizing is also sizes larger than anticipated,0
80,First let me say that the photo does not do this exquisite print justice the fabric is worth framing on a white ground the tones of rose pink purple and touches of blue make it even more fabulous the fit is a tad large as i am and usually an size but must size up to or m because of my chest even zipped it is a tad big but nothing that i cannot deal with i dont really see the swing in the dress as it does not flare out in any way but is certainly is loose and flowing bu,1
81,This is the most flattering dress i have bought in years the fact that its machine washable was a huge plus fabric is so comfortable and the length is perfect i wear either m or l and went with the large for a little extra room but either would have fit well,1
82,These are very nice pants good quality and as expected however they do run small i generally wear a small or size sometimes a depending on the maker on average a these i measured were to sizing sending back and going a size up,1
83,I tried on the xs in store and loved it stylist said i need xs petite but otherwise it looks great the cut is flattering the neckline is a tad higher and almost has a mini cowl the colors are neutral and would love to wear with a nice pair of dark flared pants or skinnies so at lbs dd i would go with xs petite i am below fabric is very soft too,1
84,I am a pretty curvy girl and thought the ml was gigantic i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well it was not flattering because it was so boxy,0
85,This has lovely embroidery of good quality and it is nicely lined in the embroidered section too it is a very loose swingy shape so size down,1
86,I would describe as an upgraded tshirt a perfect flowy top that you can dress up or down comfortable and soft material,1
87,I purchased the turquoise in a petite xs normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right i am ft inches and lbs the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit but it is a bit weak so it can tear easily it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already,1
88,I love the details that this cardigan has try it,1
89,When i saw this shirt it bought back wonderful memories of ice skating on wheatleys pond as a child where i primarily grew up in the northeast just loved it i tried my normal size on but it fell off my shoulders and the cuffs fell mid hand so i tried the size and it fit perfectly i see where many say it runs small and for full busted ladies it may but i am only b and lbs and the size worked fine it is slightly blousey in the mid section but not overly so the fabric and stitch,1
90,This is an understated elegant denim dress the fabric color is just the right fade and thickness not too thin and not too thick which is appropriate for most occasions its very soft and can get a bit wrinkly but nothing major my local retailer has only the regular size and its true to size size my usual size for holding horses brand fit well around the bust and waist area im b waist hips busty gals may want to size up this dress shows cleavage so if youre conscious like,1
91,Ive been looking for a nice summer maxi dress and after reading some positive reviews i decided to get the dress the fabric is soft and has a nice flow to it however i had to return the dress because the cuff of the sleeve was too tight on my forearm which make it impossible for me to raise my armsi ordered size petite xxs,0
92,I love this dress the fabric is butter soft the strapless top stays in place and it hangs beautifully it is such a wonderfully comfortable summer dress as previously stated im in love,1
93,I am absolutely in love with this bathing suit and i want it in every color possible i bought the black one last year and wore it all summer as no other suit that i already owned could compare i get compliments on it every where i go its flattering comfy and its a one piece that doesnt make me feel frumpy buy this suit,1
94,An awful dress retailer why didnt you post my last review i would not even give it a quarter of a star,0
95,This dress is super soft and really flattering im and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it its one ive been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets its great for these fall days that are still warmish would be really cute with tights,1
96,I love this little jean jacket i am petite and usually get a xxsp but went for a size up im glad i did it fits a little snug the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me i love this over maxi dresses tanks etc adorable jacket great buy,1
97,This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it no spare buttons included but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it not big enough of an issue to return,1
98,I absolutely adore peplum tops although some of them are made for individuals with short torsos this one is beautifully designed with a long torso and flowing wrists there is a nice balance between the fitted torso and then the flowing peplum and sleeves the best thing of all is the fabric which is a stretchy midweight jacquard it is easy to get on with a zipper in the back i am sure i will get a lot of use out of this as the weather turns cooler and i plan on pairing it with pencil ski,1
99,Its a cozy sweater that doesnt make me feel frumpy still stylish and its not too heavy but still warm enough its like wearing a blanket sort of definitely sheer with the big loom wear a camisole under it i got compliments the first day i wore it,1
100,Love this dress it has a nice stretchy weight to it and is texturally interesting its the first retailer piece that i ever bought my teenage daughter and she looks so sophisticated in it like a young lady its both classy and youthful for reference shes and is wearing a,1
101,I am an hourglass figure with a d cup i rarely wear trapeze tops as they make me appear larger this is a very lovely top fits nice i was a medium and hits nicely around hips im perfect for a special night out,1
102,These tights are perfect they seem like they will last a couple seasons with minimal wear just the slightest texture and not shiny i got the beigebrown to layer with dressesskirts and boots love,1
103,I love these pants so much i had to write a review purchased the carbon color recently in regular length the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me size was also tts typically wear size and got ive been wearing them often they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely ive been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season i also think the quality is much better i will be getting them in more colors,1
104,I saw this piece and fell in love with it the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece it is a little boxy and is a bit warm for indoors but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws i am usually a small but sized up to a medium with this one,1
105,Love the detailing around the neck of this top looks great under cardigan or by itself i sized down to an xs seems to be of good quality although to lengthen its life i dont plan on putting it in the dryer,1
106,This skirt is nicer in person the fit is a little strange the waist is tts but rest of the skirt runs a size large i am a curvy size and purchased the based on another review the waist is a tad snug but overall the skirt fits its too beautiful to return,1
107,I really love this dress the fit is flattering and comfortable the fabric has a pale art nouveau background with indian and middle eastern prints over it the beadwork does really pop and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts for lovers of etros bohemian style who dont want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress,1
108,Ive been a fan of the pilcro chinos for years but the jeans have not been the right fit for me usually wind up too big in the waist to accommodate the hips well the em is aptly named as they are made to fit a girl i usually wear a and the fit comfortably and i could probably even go down a size thank you retailer please make more in this style,1
109,Gorgeous colors high quality my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight if you have a large chest c this is going to be snug or not fit at all im wearing it now in pregnancy but i think it will also look great postpartum can be dressed up or down,1
110,Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning i usually wear a size because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a in this top it was not tight in the arms dont have super skinny arms and the fabric flows nicely not too much the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit,1
111,I ordered both the petite and regular in the olive green motif the regular fit more as i was hoping so i returned the petitei am only but my legs are long for my height i wasnt ready to have the side slits up to here and whereas they are not they are still quite high it is modest enough to be worn any place i might wear the dress i think i will likely wear a belt with it as shown at least part of the time i just bought some print fabric sling back shoes which go beautifully with,1
112,Just got this dress and am very pleased fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price color is as shownbeautiful lace trim at the bottomback longer than front as described and pockets i am and length on a large comes to just below the kneesin fronti may wear leggings under itdont like the slip as it is far too tightwill wear a tee or turtle under it quality heavier fabric roomy linen and cotton,1
113,Right out of the bag this top didnt really match the one pictured here it is the right top though the fabric was heavy and felt damp the way something feels coming out of the wash very oddand the fit is nothing like whats shown on the model the v is not fitted or nicely wrapped or even tacked in place it was just two loose droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged im neither flat chested nor busty,0
114,I am and lbs for reference and pear shaped and this dress in a petite fit like a glove granted not a dress i would want to gain weight in but fit perfectly usually i am a in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am,1
115,I loved the photo of this dress upon examination of the dress and trying it on after receiving in the mail the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear,0
116,I love this skirt it fits perfectly great to transition from work to afterwork event very comfy got lots of complements,1
117,This s aprsski style sweater is made of an amazingly soft pure wool in a color that is a touch brighter and maybe even a bit more coral pink than the online photo looks to me there is a large button under the collar that shows if you stand it up seems to be of a very high quality comparable to vintage handknit sweatersit is very chunky and warm and i would recommend taking a size up for a looser fit im narrow shoulders and otth the xs and s fit me well running,1
118,Love this shirt its easy to throw on and makes a cute outfit with about any kind of bottoms ive wore it with leggings and jeans,1
119,This dress references that it is off the shoulder in the description but i did not find it to be so it fits me as pictured on the model sort of a ballet neck or wide scoop neck in any case the fabric is as pictured and its lined yay not see through the varying sizes of stripes give it interest despite the neutral colors it is cute with a denim jacket and is really comfortable,1
120,These pajama pants are dreamy in all ways incredibly soft with a soft and not binding elastic waist plus the print is evocativei am and a size i bought these in the store the only size left was one pair of xs sure enough they fitthe length is perfect i just ordered a pair for my sister,1
121,I love this dress it is a fun and flirty summer dress i think it can be dressed up or worn casually i am a c waist hips i bought a size and it fits me great as others said it is a little snug across the chest but i think it is supposed to be with the proper bra it fits very comfortably i am going to wear it for mothers day brunch,1
122,I wore this tunic everyday on vacation in hawaii runs a little small im usually a small and the xsmall was just right perfect length short but not too short,1
123,I could live in these they are so comfy i typically wear a and got the medium they are a little roomy probably could have gotten a smallbut i like them kinda loose and baggy i will probably purchase another color,1
124,I love this dressi have it in the other color black and white but now i see this color scheme and i think i may actually like this one better i love the wider stripes near the waistline which gives it a slimming appearance the knotted look gives this dress a beachy feel which gets me in the mood for summertime i love that the pattern is bold but the color scheme allows this dress to still stay in the casual category and still be insanely flattering i love that i could wear this dress eve,1
125,This tee is my favorite this year it just looks great on not fitted but not loose either i love it so much i have it in white black pink light green gray slate blue and holly the holly was my least favorite color i thought it would look a little greener it is so dark you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just becausei love the fact that it can be machine warned and dried without shrinking i dont dr,1
126,I bought this dress as a consolation prize when another dress i wanted didnt suit me i was shocked by how flattering it was because on the hanger it was just meh the material is soft jersey heathered and it hangs well it has a simple lining but that doesnt interfere with the fit it is a little low for my personal taste so i wear a cami or scarf but for those less well endowed youd probably be fine without one for the record i typically wear a pounds and ddd br,1
127,So i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point and intent at retailer so i had hopes i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days but its honestly so thin i couldnt even see it working that well for that its also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti,0
128,I ordered this dress in size xl in the greyredyellow combination i love everything about this dress its comfortable the colors are cheerful the proportions of where the stripes are placed works but i have to return this dress its too short for what im comfortable wearing i saw from the photos that this comes midthigh on the taller models i hoped that would mean it would be more kneelength for me unfortunately its just too short and id feel selfconscious i dont want to deal,1
129,Got this in the white and it fits perfectly just the right length and enough detail on the shoulders im and usually an xxs or xs for tops and the xs fits just right not too loose not too tight i like the style since it emphasizes my shoulders and balances nicely with cropped jeans im pear shaped material is slightly clingy but it adds to the drape nicely wouldnt work well if it was fitted but its not,1
130,This dress looks amazing online in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering pattern is dizzying in person very thin multi layer dress should be better material and quality for this price save your money and shipping,0
131,I looked at this top online thought abt wearing w shorts later saw that its cotton which i love decided to order my usual size small in the black the moss arrived yesterday happened to have on a pair of leggings tried on the tops wow really cute w leggings looks like i can wear w skinnys shorts or leggings so im happy w that may even go w a skirt or slacksthe cap sleeves are cute the top flares some but not overwhelming or maternitylike plenty of room on my s,1
132,Great design execution this is essentially a striped jersey sleeveless turtleneck made of a nice highquality jersey with a delicate lightweight soft sweater attached over it so you get this really pretty look where the jersey underlay means the sweater hangs beautifully no clinging at all and the sleeves are just the sheer sweater so prettyi got the lavender looks exactly like the pic and it is true to size,1
133,I bought this top in a large i washed it in cold water and it shrank just enough to flatter the material is great in that when i washed it the blouse hanged quite nicely no ironing needed also the material is heavy enough that no tank is needed underneath the top thakoon had made the same top last summer and it had cost around this top is even better due to the material and i could buy it for a fraction of the price highly recommend,1
134,Just got this yesterday and im wearing it today super comfy for running errands with the kids and going to and from the gymor just to lounge around the house i go between a m and l and went with a m since its flowy and it fits great,1
135,This cozy sweater looks great with skinny jeans or leggings as a yearold woman who loves retailer im always on the lookout for cute clothes that dont make me look like im trying to dress too young this sweater is comfy and stylish and looks really classy i wore it to a holiday party and got many compliments which is unusual for what is basically a simple ivory sweater it breathes has just the right amount of room in the sleeves and was a great purchase i wish i had bought other colo,1
136,I just returned this top i agree with the previous reviewer the neckline is way too deep i ordered small and i looked ridiculous in it also the ruffles didnt look so great on me either,0
137,Runs a little big but super comfortable and looks great with jeans slightly tucked in,1
138,You want to buy this its so comfy and stylish yet casual the sale price is amazing if anything the arms of the coat are a bit thin compared to the body of the coat overall it fits well though i ordered an xs i almost want to order the other color i love it so much i will probably wear this year round but it will be especially cute in autumn,1
139,This is the perfect casual yet stylish dress and its extremely comfortable,1
140,I love love love this sweater it is slightly fitted so that is drapes beautifully notice it has length sleeves which is fine for north caroline where it does not really get cold i purchased the blue and i wore it with fitted jeans,1
141,I wore this for the first time today and after just about an hour it gently nicked something and got a hole in the pack its so disappointing as i love they style and its so comfortable very poor quality for the price,0
142,This top is really pretty however i found it to be super small i know meadow rue tends to run small but this small was like an extra small im not large chested either if you are super straightthin with a long torso this is the top for you,1
143,Purchased these in the blue motif love the hei hei brand they run true to size they are very comfortable and wear well you can wear them to the officedress them up or go casual with a tee versatility and comfort what more could you ask for,1
144,I love this dress i think it will be awesome to wear this summer but also a great transition piece into fall very boho,1
145,As soon as i saw this dress i absolutely fell in love with it when i got it i noticed it was slightly small but figured i could deal with it i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back i could fix it but honestly a dress shouldnt start falling apart before you even wear it its cut on the small side wish i tried the larger one but now its sold out and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured i,0
146,This should have been cute but the fabric choice ruching design made me look like i had elephant skin rippling around my waist super unflattering,0
147,I love this dress i bought this dress in both a m and a s i was worried about how loose the dress would fit and also how short it would be the information about the model wearing the dress only said that she was but not what size dress she was wearing i am and am in between a dress size or the medium was way too wide but the small was still long enough with the perfect amount of flow i purchased the greenslate color which is more green and has very faint stripes very,1
148,Love this pullover for its versatile style can be buttoned or unbuttoned and easy care look its casual without looking sloppy the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage the hilo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl the hem is straighter soft nubbly texture that may snag easily got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too,1
149,I was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves from the photo it looked like full length sleeves it went back,0
150,I have had my eye on this coat for a while and then my size was sold out when it popped back i ordered it i am and i had wondered if i needed the petite petite was sold out because of all the reviews i had read however the sleeve length is perfect in a petite the sleeves would be too short i dont have long arms so i am surprised some reviewers have complained about the sleeves being too long the button placement is not at the waist but that is the style the lapels are long,1
151,Beautiful angel of the north sweater tts lovely color and a staple classic,1
152,I really wanted to like this but the fit was just off it made me look like i was very pregnant and i usually wear loose and flowy tops too this one was just too much material i am usually an xs and that was the right size for me i thought about taking to a seamstress and having some of the material taken in but decided in the end to return because i just didnt love it the pink color and the fabric are nice though there were several hanging threads too which is why i gave quality a,0
153,Just bought red today to wear to a conference to stay warm over floreat peasant blouse and pilcro serif jeans love love very flattering and plan to wear with skirts on airplanes for warmth and for travel very versatile highly recommend,1
154,Fell in love at first site cozy and wonderful design that creates a slim line even with full figure,1
155,I wear between a l and xli chose the xl which was the right choiceif you are a bit curvy in proportions i could size up the color is gorgeousi just logged back on to order another if there were options but alas there are not flattering arm cut could be worn for work or with jeans out to dinner its cute you wont regret it as a side note it is sheerwhich you can see in the photo needs a cami,1
156,I am wearing these as i type this they are unbelievably cozy would wear them as loungewear if it werent for the fact that they also look so so cute and i want to wear them out so soft and a really good fit higher than my other leggings so i dont have to pull them up ever but also just really fashionable looking love one of my favorite retailer purchases ever,1
157,First off they are much prettier irl than in the photos online they fit very large on me i am usually a or but have hips so ordered the wrong decision i needed the,1
158,This top is beautiful even more so in person however like a previous reviewer the fit is very boxy there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you cant see in the photos due to the models cardigan and arms if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted without all the excess fabric at the bottom it would have been perfect again the color the lace the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,0
159,I have had good luck with cloth and stone and this did not disappoint i knew i would like it because i have this same top in a long sleeve and sleeveless it is cute not too sheer and easy to iron,1
160,This hoodie was too thin you can see right through it i returned it,0
161,This is the first one piece swimsuit ive owned since i was a toddler im and lbs b bust with short torso and athletic built legsso i wasnt sure how this would fit was i ever surprised i bought the size small in the mint chevron pattern the material is substantial but not overly thick it is double layered and the cups are padded for extra coverage it was a little tight to pull on but after having it on it conformed to my curves like it was cut to fit them the top offers an,1
162,Adorable comfortable dress the denim is super soft with a bit of stretch please be advised this dress runs very large especially through the hips i normally wear a size and the large was swimming on me i will definitely be exchanging it for a smaller size,1
163,This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure woman i have a inch bust and the medium fit perfectlythe whole dress fit perfectly im so glad i took a risk and ordered it i wish it was made from a better material like cotton versus polyester but it has such a nice fit that ill forgive the material choice,1
164,This is a lovely sweater that doesnt look much on me the way it does on the model in the picture i actually like it better on me its got a good scoop neck and it gives me a shape i tried it on in a small and im on the fence about whether to buy it or not i dont really need it but with the discount codes retailer is offering these days i feel like i should buy it anyway,1
165,I love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back its an absolute staple in my wardrobe now,1
166,For a now feel that comfy and well made this was a great choice,1
167,I was attracted to the colors when i first saw itthen i saw the back of it the largest sz in the store was an i had to order it and got a sz i then returned it for a in order for it to drape properly in front shorter than i usually wear but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely and that back not only is is striking i am able to wear my regular bra under it and the straps dont hang out,1
168,Probably one of my favorite turtle neck sweaters it looks so chic and cute on,1
169,So much right but thentoo short,0
170,I really was surprised at how much i liked this top it is as others pointed out a poncho type overlay with a tank connected underneath it is very comfortable and forgiving of any body boo boos looks great with skinny white pants,1
171,After reading the other reviews i took a chance and ordered the peach one and the blue red one in large i am usually at the top end of xls but ive noticed that holding horses items tend to run a bit bigger i hit the jackpot with this one yes its a little boxy all the better to hide what i want to hide the length is perfect for me and the gathers at the shoulders give enough room across the chest so that it doesnt pull at the buttons the peach one came today and i was a bit sur,1
172,These are the perfect highwaisted skinny jeans they fit tts and dont stretch out are the perfect length for cute falls or tucked into boots i adore them,1
173,I usually wear size for dress but this is the first time ever i have to go down to size and it fits perfectly well made maybe a bit stiff around armholes nothing major i love the length as i dont like to show my knees great color combinations although this supposed to be a summer dress it looks great for fall just need to add a jacket a pair of boots and im good to go feeling pretty,1
174,Love this saw online didnt place the order and when i came back it was gone retailer restocked so i got it second time around ordered the red option this shirt is beautiful sometimes the online photos dont do the piece justice but this time its even better in person the embroidered detail is gorgeous the fabric is light weight and the back of the shirt has button down panels that are almost linenlike in look and feel the fit is just as pictured imo bringing this on vacation with m,1
175,This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable i dont usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans i am a d and the medium was a perfect fit,1
176,I normally stay away from dresses like these because they have a tendency to make my tall hourglass frame look like i had one too many burgers however i saw one left in the store and was drawn in by its color and beautiful sequins my thoughts belowpros exactly as pictured i got the purple option but i did see another lady grab the green both are beautiful in different ways like another mentioned the sequins on the bottoms gives some weight to the dress but in a g,1
177,Ive gotten so many compliments ill never buy a bathing suit anywhere else i buy all my suits from here now,1
178,Ok so this is true to size i recently had a baby i gained a lot of weight am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online i am with a long torso short legs and a big fat butt so buying pants especially rompers are almost impossible lengthwise this fits me like pants the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit i dont think ive ever been so happy with an retailer pu,1
179,I completely agree with the other reviewer this sweater is so much prettier in person ive been looking for years for a tasteful fur sweater and i think i finally found it the size large was true to size for me aside from the very long sleeves but i also have short arms the fur isnt overwhelming and i love the pockets i usually find sweaters with wool itchy but this one is not its wool i do plan to wear a cami or tank underneath,1
180,This dress is a beautiful classic dress that is figure flattering and as stunning in person as it is in the photo i love it,1
181,Cute and simple top a little tight through the bust looks great tucked or out and super cute with a simple jacket easy piece to dress up or down,1
182,This has such awful proportions im and lbs ordered xxs petite in the neutral color the seam at the bust literally hits in the middle of my bust it looks very unflattering and its very pronounced im only and already the seam hits at such a high point on me below the seam the sweater is all scrunched up where its sewed and it balloons outward and is very square from there down very shapeless sweater and not flattering at all unless you have your arms by your sides to hi,0
183,I ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model its meant to be loose flowy so i think its true to size everything matches the photosthe sleeve length hem neckline etc its not a slimming look but doesnt make me look bigger than i am eitherthe material is a very soft cotton the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft its washed well,1
184,A piece of polyester with no shape and looks good only on the model avoid mine went back the same day it came in the mail,0
185,These shorts are extremely cute i usually have a hard time finding shorts i like but when i saw these the floral and brocade was too nice not to try the length is good and they are not tight on the thighs but not too loose either the material makes them friendly for work as well as outings and running about town i got my usual size and found that to work perfectly,1
186,This looks just like the picture its soft and very comfortable looks great with skinny jeans and boots love it,1
187,This blouse is so pretty i love the design the material and the pattern is so unique i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princessfeeling i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints i adore it and feel so good wearing it if i could change anything id m,1
188,Bought this size small and orange needed something to where home beautiful comfortable light and airy paired it with retailers manella stack pendant necklace even better received alot of compliments the color stood out,1
189,This top looks great on the model a petite frame smallbusted body i am and have a large bust and curvy hips this top hit in all the wrong places the front looks very cropped and frumpy if you have a large bust the width of the top of very boxy the top is very soft and comfortable and the color is pretty,0
190,The deep v doesnt gape and flatters the neckline while the waisthigh side slits reveal enough to keep this drapey shirt from looking shapeless the material is so lovely and soft and comfy but clings in the right places to really flatter while problem areas get draped in the most perfect way,1
191,Just piping in here ordered my usual size of small petite the slip that came with the dress is about a size negative zero it could hardly squeeze over my body and the dress itself is a bright pale aqua and it is a shift and because of the smocking it hangs very strangely i think it looks very cheap and is ill fitting i would say if you are a person on which shift dresses look awesome you might like this but mind the size of the slip in the petites range and also it is aqua,0
192,I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect the details on it are amazingdelicate and lovely i am and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes,1
193,Fit true to size and very well hit the leg at a good length im they were perfect,1
194,Soft fitted without being tight flattering neckline nice embroidery,1
195,I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat the sleeves are very wide although long as a light weight fall coat the sleeves dont need to be as wide because you wouldnt be layerng too much underneath the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh,0
196,I purchased the moss green version of this sweater in a m petite im lbs with a full bust i love it it fits beautifully and i have received many compliments on it from both friends and students and for a high school teacher thats high praisewhen i saw the purple version i debatedtwo of the same very distinctive style the answer was a resounding yes cant waitthe only minor warning about the sweater it was very itchy on me the first time i wore it second time ok,1
197,Love this top on sale i bought two of this color a grey and the green i never buy more than one of anything unless i absolutely love it complimentary to the body and the colors are beautiful im there were no pxs so i opted for xs perfect thanks retailer,1
198,Stylish and super comfy even though its a relaxed oversize fit it is still very flattering and pretty i dressed it up with cool jeans and my fave free suede boots my only complaint is that it is not available in more colors pretty please make more color variations,1
199,I love this tunic it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttonsi like the slight sheen of the fabric as well wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort im going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans i suspect it will also be great to travel in the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned,1
200,Gorgeous but so so small recommend ordering sizes up,1
201,I get nervous shopping online but this top fit perfectly wasnt too long or too short it has nice flow and dresses up or down depending on the look youre going for i got the offwhite with blue polkadots and love it,1
202,I usually take a small in retailer tops i did have to order this in a medium though because it is slightly more form fitting the material seems a little thin so i hope it holds up well over time i love the green color though i am curvy especially on the bottom and this was very flattering on me i do think it is too expensive for what it is especially with the material being thin even at sales price overall though i thought it flattering enough to keep,1
203,I feel in love with the dress when i saw it hanging at the store usually i feel bailey dresses make my body look really round and short ive passed up a few because i didnt find them too flattering i almost even just passed this one up because of my past experiences but i tried it on and felt like i had the body of another person it hugged my body very nicely and i felt like it gave me a shape i also saw all the possibilities it had the store had it styled with a denim jacket i can,1
204,Unlike one comment below a review on here who stated it felt childish i didnt feel this way at all im a sucker for anything white with tulle and soft colors and a bit of bling heres my thoughtspros very soft with good amount of stretch tulle bottom is exactly as pictured i disagree with another reviewer who said the color was more of taupe it is not this is pinknude shade all the way runs tts im a c hourglass and found the medium to be,1
205,The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth the cut of this vest is also bad will be sent back,0
206,Like other reviewers when i saw this top in person i was struck by it i would never have even looked twice at it online i hardly ever buy things at full price from retailer but i treated myself to this one the only thing id disagree with is that it runs true to size at my store there was only left in a size im usually a but i figured id try it on since the style is loose anyway and the fit very nicely i did try a in another store and found the slits came too high and th,1
207,The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life it is flowy flattering and elegant not to mention warm and soft i hope it holds up,1
208,Cute tunic fits on the fitted side but i love it with a vest layered over nice material,1
209,I cannot say enough about these pajama pants theyre beautiful and crazy comfortable its a nice change from black or grey i also love that there are no pockets because i hate how they jut out on me i wanted a petite l because i am short but the regular large is fine i just wear them higher up on my hips i normally wait for sales on sleepwear but i couldnt resist on these theyre well worth the investment,1
210,I tried this on in the store and came online for the petite size the length was fine on me its only the sleeves that would be better for me in petite this cardigan is very cute the dots are a bit more artylooking in person than you can see here more like watercolor or ink spots which is a nice subtle touch i put runs small just because i think you might want to size up if you plan on wearing much in the way of layers underneath the merino wool is not itchy it is nice and soft i,1
211,I love the idea of this top but there is just way too much fabric involved in person im and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering i feel like they could have made about shirts out of it i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back the silhouette is nothing like shown if there were just less fabric i wo,0
212,Love this shirt so much it is comfortable and a beautiful print i sized down because it is very flowy it is ivory instead of white but still looks beautiful one of my favorite tops,1
213,I love ag jeans these jeans fit snug but not confining they have some stretch to the material so that you can move with ease i love the way they fit my body with one exception unfortunately they did not have the petite available so the length is about to inches too long on my frame the dark blue makes it acceptable for casual friday yay i am lbs and even though i will have to hem them the overall fit was great,1
214,Love the material more natural fiber than synthetic the pattern and the colors also it is cozy the one con is that it is really big and crazylong so long that it may be a showstopper on the fence about that,1
215,Love this piece it is warm and attractive and will set any outfit off from a dress to jeans and a tshirt i look forward to wearing it often,1
216,This is going to be perfect for my daughters graduation she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her,1
217,I really love this top it is soft lightweight and really pretty it has quickly become one of my favorites,1
218,This dress is a home run on all accounts the embroidery is gorgeous the fabric is highquality and the aline cut is slimming i found this dress to run true to size i am and the length hits above the kneeso it could be longer on shorter heights i purchased the white dress initially and now have also ordered the navy,1
219,The color of this dress is sublime so is the fit ruching in all the right places made me feel glamorous its a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat vest or cropped jacket the material feels so nice against the skin too its a must have,1
220,This top is great for those days when you have nothing to wear just throw this on and get ready for the compliments,1
221,It is such a pretty dress the pics dont do this dress any justice the cut and style is so flattering the colors are gorgeous you can wear it on a cool evening in summer and well into fall i absolutely love this dress even if the material appears a bit rough there is a slip underneath,1
222,Comfy casual and stylish i received many compliments on this shirt it drapes across your body very nicely and does not cling it has a great asymmetrical cut that is very flattering the material is comfortable and the color is warm and summerlike,1
223,This was so boxy and unflattering i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit sizing down would not help this one went back,0
224,I am a dd and lbs and this top was way too baggy it looked awful this is shapeless and oversized i would size down or just pass,0
225,This is a beautiful dress and fits well the embroidery is delicate and can snag easily,1
226,This is my first romper and i am in love so comfortable and easily dressed up or down i am usually an xs small or petite small in retailer brands the xs worked best for me the petite small was too big i am and the length of the xs is perfect ankle length i was nervous to put it in the washer on delicate cycle but it came out perfectly,1
227,Everything about this top is perfect quality is great which is number one in my book color is awesome perfect color for fall summer and spring a must have,1
228,I love this dress i bought the navy with white stripes it is comfortable flattering and versatile best of all i received a complement from my husband who never comments on my clothing the drapey knit fabric fits closely but not tightly in the shoulders and bust and then skims over the lower body the fabric is soft and stretchy not too thick but still substantial enough that i did not need to wear support garments underneath i am lbs i wore this to a christmas party and,1
229,I like these jeans when i wore them i received compliments they do run large i sized down one size but probably could have sized down two sizes they feel tight when you first put them on but as you wear them they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist my other complaint is a small one the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move after awhile my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it that is why i gave this only stars for desi,1
230,I love this shirt i bought it in both black and white and i get compliments every time i wear it i totally recommend this top its a great material and easy to wear with a lot of different bottoms,1
231,Love this top so much its very unique and one of those tops thats effortless to wear i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written but i find it to be flattering and comfortable im glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium my usual size would have been too big,1
232,I tried this shirt in the purple motif it fit true to size my normal small worked well all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in really on a white shirt it annoyed me so much i didnt buy the shirt,0
233,Perfect top i love the mix of materials silky in the front and comfy knit in the back the tie on the side is adorable and adds a little something special to the shirt happy,1
234,If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful the ties drop pretty low look trashy over cleavage recommend otherwise good fabric cool look,0
235,I originally bought this in a petite xs i am tall on a good day sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves the overall look is much better i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think a winner,1
236,Wide fit usually an at retailer got a large for online order and was large for sure great for summer or winter with long sleeve and tights,1
237,This dress looked gorgeous light and lacy in the picture but when it arrived the lace that appeared gold and black in the photo was more a solid brown pattern against the black which was not attractive the inner sheath was made of a heavy sequined material it was uncomfortable scratchy and felt like i was searing chain mail it also added bulk to the dress so that i looked ten pounds heavier i cant imagine why they would design this delicate dress with such a heavy inner slip the si,0
238,Saw this in the store yesterday and had my daughter try it on it was really cute on her and she loved it in fairness to the other reviewers she tried on a size which was perfect for her petite frame and i can see how this blouse would run really big in the larger sizes but the fabric and detail is so pretty and it was on sale,1
239,I love these pjs the sale price finally made the set affordable and i could not be happier so soft and comfy,1
240,After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted so i took a chance and ordered a regular size i am lbs so i typically order a petite received this today and am very happy i made that choice the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees the fabric is perfect for winter i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box it was very heavy the lace,1
241,This blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great silk is always light and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt im wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks,1
242,Love the detailing is so pretty and finally its a top thats comfortably long retailer has been making all of their tops so short lately im and a dd i ordered a large simply because its a cotton tee and i didnt want a fitted look per se my only criticism would be that the material is a little thin in the front i just ordered it in black too,1
243,This coat is a classic i would wear it every day if it wasnt so distinct very comfortable flattering and stylish,1
244,Absolutely love this sweater it is a tad bit large i bought it in a medium but because i like the loose fit i will keep it it is very light and great for the summer ive only worn it once so far and received many compliments on it great quality as well,1
245,I love this dress it is exactly my style which is probably why i love it girly frilly flowy i love how much material it has it flows and twirls in such a nice way because of the amount of fabric its the right length that the amount of material is not overwhelming im and it hits just above my knees i am currently months pregnant and its plenty roomy to fit now and will also mask the postbaby belly this summer the only cons and the other reviewers touched on these as,1
246,Great fabric soft and easy to wear and goes from day to night easily,1
247,I usually wear a but ordered a because of the previous reviews the fit perfectly the was too snug across the shoulders both sizes were the same length and width except the shouldersthe material is beautiful and seems very well made i am thrilled with this purchaseit looks exactly like the photo,1
248,I loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that doesnt wrinkle i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt will wear often,1
249,I love this sweater tunic the neckline adds interest and is so flattering i think it is more flattering in person than in the photos of the model my husband even noticed the neckline and said he loves this top on me it is soft and not itchy at all i bought my regular size small and will wear it with jeans or leggings and boots i love that this neckline comes up a bit but is not huge so i can definitely pair a scarf with it for a change if i wanted to this will definitely be a staple in,1
250,They are as comfortable as sweat pants i can wear these all day and then some and be comfy i love the fit skinnys can be hard for me i have athletic thighs and the length is fantastic i want more pairs in different washes,1
251,I had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered but i took a chance and ordered the regular size i love it it is a little long in the back but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt so cute with skinny jeans and leggings it is one of my favorite fall tops i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays,1
252,Great casual pant for the summer wish there were more colors white or beige would be great comfortable great fit sizing is consistent with my normal designer denim sizing im also and the regular size pant is just right for me,1
253,This sweater came in just as expected adorable as others have said it is soft and comfy i will wear it everywhere including work i love it,1
254,Nice loosefitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall i had no problem with the slip being too tight lbs and went with my normal size it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders its great with boots or flats,1
255,Just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it the true color is a little darker i would call it a taupe the fabric is really nice i am a c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences and they run small the medium is perfect for my size i usually order a small panty and this one fits it looks smaller than pictured on the model this set is one of a kind the pattern on fabric is really beautiful i think it is worth the price if you like lingerie,1
256,After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini i love the fit bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls but still stylish the top is a perfect fit little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom,1
257,This sweet dress is perfect for fall and spring because the knit is not too thick the drape allows layers and the colors are very versatile the style is loose if you stay tts but will be a slimmer fit if you size down if your body habitus is super slender definitely size down the liner slip is soft and the back side of the knit is a bit scratchy i think this dress is beautiful and best of all forgiving im happy to have tried both colorsthe problem is picking which one to keep m,1
258,I was so excited to try this on in the store because ive had my eye on it online unfortunately it is not like the picture the material is very thin almost translucent i also could not figure out how it get it on the cape has short sleeves not long as it appears in the picture and the folds of fabric would not drape quite right in the front love the look of black design on white hopefully retailer can redo this in a thicker cape for the fall but for now ill skip this one,0
259,The dress looks even better in person the fabric is very delicate though but worth the extra care it needs the fit was perfect and the color is just as in the picture,1
260,These are the perfect tightsfit and feel are top quality and they wash well,1
261,I wanted to love this dress and did from the picture online when it arrived the black already looked faded and old also the embroidery looks like a grandma but not in a cute vintage way the fabric is stiff which causes a boxy unflattering look had to return it,0
262,I love the print on these pants they are beautifully flowy and flattering the only downside is that they are see through so im going to take them to tailor to have a lining put in up to the knee so i can wear them to places other than the beach i bought them on sale today in the store and bought a size small,1
263,My favorite jeans i have ever purchased they fit just right i wear them everywhere,1
264,This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print the details are to die for the blue is not the same as the picture slightly darker and more muted,1
265,This is a very comfy dresstunic i like to wear it with leggings washed well nice color looks nice with boots nice find,1
266,I bought this sweater on a whim in the store without trying it on when i got home i decided it would probably lose its shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it a few days later desperate for something to wear i grabbed it and decided to keep it merely to have something to wear that day im so glad i didthis is a great sweater layered with a cami it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow it is structured so it doesnt feel sloppy it has w,1
267,Iim not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it looks good dressed up wa nice top or casual wa tee can be worn practically all year love it,1
268,This skirt is a rare find slimming flowing and best of all it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look the fabric is substantial yet soft so no weird sticking out sides the color is delicious very paletearose better in person that the picture here and is fresh for summer nice length for office easy to pair with either fitting or loose tops and jackets i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to,1
269,This top is simple but beautiful i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl it is a swing top but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing i am around and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at alli love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i likea great staple for your closet,1
270,This dress is beautiful on it is flowy and loose but is cut well so it avoids looking like a tent white dresses with lace can run the risk of being a bit fussy the lace at the bottom is a beautiful detail without being too precious and the handkerchief bottom keeps it interesting can be styled so many ways looks great with a cropped denim jacket belted or loose with a long necklace also tried with a sleeveless long sweater vest and it was adorable the dress is fully lined and feels su,1
271,This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere the quality is nice maybe sizing down would help but the mediumlarge is going back i am normally a medium,0
272,I found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress it is prettier in person i have the ivory and black print i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly i might wear a different slip however i was able to get the slip to stay in place the print and fabric are a nice quality i typically wear an xxsp or a p i bought this in the regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer i think it runs just a little bit small,1
273,This dress is the perfect combo of flattering comfort and quality i purchased the turquoise color which is vibrant this will be my go to dress for spring the material is super soft flowy and medium weight i ordered petite s probably could have got xs i love love love this dress,1
274,The pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love im a cd and normally wear an or and bought this in a large the front buttons dont peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops im actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns too,1
275,I was in search of a few sweaters that were functional for the winter but also fit my style i will have to wear a camisole underneath but i love the feel and the fit i always have a problem finding sleeves that are long enough the sleeves are an appropriate length,1
276,This top is beautifully made but comfortable the neckline is a stretch fabric and the cut is very flattering the length is just short enough that it doesnt look like a dress,1
277,I first tried this dress in my usual size and thought it was a pretty fabric but boring and not particularly flattering i later read the positive reviews and the next time i was in the store i tried it in a and it was so much better very pretty shape uiu might want to size down because the shoulders were set a little wide apart and bodice was gapping in my usual size for reference im lbs,1
278,This dress is like a piece of art absolutely beautiful on i wore it to a charity event and received several compliments its just so gorgeously different,1
279,What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design i know that this sweaterjacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall winter and years to come its a classic beauty when i put it on it has a comfortable vibe high quality medium weight dark black wool and beautiful lines i love the deep collar slightly lower back hem and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st,1
280,Unique print but not great execution the pant legs are very tight i have average sized calves and i sized up one size the hook closure was oddly tight and difficult to clasp when i first saw the color it looked like burnt sienna or a dried blood color too bad this didnt work out,0
281,I am so pleased with my purchase the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique the attached matching adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful i am and a a if you have been considering this dress dont delay especially at the wonderful sale price,1
282,Purchased in the blue polka dot and love it am lbs long arms dress is meant to be full i dont see the that is runs large the shoulders fit the sleeves are not too long it is a very cute dress after receiving the dress ordered it in the black motif and hope to like it just as much as the blue,1
283,I tried this sweater on and loved it immediately its super soft and comfortable and very slimming i tried my normal size s and an xs and decided on the xs as the s gave it and me a bit of a wider look love the navy color,1
284,This shirt is purportedly made of silk but it is extremely low quality the material is coarse and scratchy its not even worth it at the extra off sale price returned,0
285,This is a beautiful dress it has great detail and is well made the tassles are very heavy which is kind of funny because the dress is light and airy it is pretty cute and sexy all in one dress,1
286,I ordered the navy which is really stunning by the wayand the cream i asked my husband to choose the color for me and he asked me to keep both of them there you have it that should say it all it is a beautifully done lace with an attached camisol liner which if im not mistaken is on snaps so that you can remove it and wear your own cami if this one has a weird fit for you the navy is really pretty due to the stark contrast of two shades of blue as i said my husband saw the cream colo,1
287,This dress is adorable the colors are vibrant and very eye catching i found it runs tts for reference im lbs and i ordered a the dress is fitted on top with some very niceforgiving pleats around the stomach,1
288,I have no where to wear this pretty spring time inspired dress fits just as pictured except that im short i ordered the p so my dd chest and wide rib cage fit comfortably im saving this dress for easter or a fancy bridal shower,1
289,Much softer fabric than i expected wrinkles easily,1
290,I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe i did not like the fit of the fish print but the stripe is perfectso try more than one color if you are interested in this style also try more than one size of course i almost always order up in a swimsuit and this time was no different the medium fit great although i am a xss according to the size guide i am a b for reference but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide i do not like to feel constricted but i still want the top to,1
291,I had my eye on this piece since it came out but thought it was a little pricier than i like spending but it finally went on sale alas all the petite sizes are gone but i decided to order the regular xs anyway the length quote is long but i figured maybe with heels then the xxs became available and i snatched that tooso glad the xxs fits better and isnt as long i have to wear heels dont get me wrong but the xs was still long with heels it is soft and lovely the xxs linin,1
292,Love this so cute to have tshirt with additional details usually get medium size in blouses but liked the fit of the large better,1
293,I want to live in this sweatshirt its so comfy but also wellcut and lays nicely not boxy at all im typically a or l in tops and the is roomy without looking sloppy,1
294,I second that above review who states worst blouse ive ever ordered,0
295,I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online once i pulled it out of the bag my first thought was how could retailer send me a used washed and shrunken sweater it is nothing like the picture it fits like a midriff top not exaggerating im ordered the m dont waste your shipping money on this,0
296,I bought this in the mauve in my usual size small i think this sweater is intentionally big and slouchy so i would say it runs true to size it is very soft and the weave is airynot going to be warm enough for a below freezing day but i love the style the neckline is a bit fussy but i think you just have to wear it and let it fall the way it wants to the sleeves are long enough to cover your hands the sweater when pulled all the way down covers my butt and half my thighs and im t,1
297,Love these pants corduroy leggings that fit like a skinny pant comfortable not too stretchy maintains shape even with multiple wears between cleaning pairs nicely with black neutral or buttery yellow tops fun print received compliments first time i wore them sizing is just right also im usually wear in denim but have to go up a size for super skinny so i ordered a p which fits me just fine,1
298,These are horrible pants they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops look great at firstafter a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere absolutely terrible i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my go to pants but these are not worth even the sale price id give them no stars if i could this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs if u must try them size down and suffer through the first few tight hours trust methey will,0
299,Great arm coverage soft material flattering fit wear with favorite wornin jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts i really should purchase another color for summer work staple,1
300,The fabric clung to my body i expected it to flow and be breezy it was too flimsy the arms were too wide and overall for this dress didnt cut the mustard im the dress was long enough just didnt flow very well,0
301,Comfortable shorts thinner fabric pattern disguises underwear lines love the exterior pockets as i wont have to tuck them in when i zip up as the previous reviewer said the black and white pattern has blue accents theyre midrise and a longer length which i appreciate,1
302,I bought this in the store so i didnt know that it was actually a sleep chemise i kind of wondered if it was supposed to be a supershort dress but the salesgirl said that it was a top so i tried it on the price is shocking but im a teacher and this month july teachers get off so that helped a little bit when i tried it on i absolutely loved it maybe i look like a cupcake but im a very happy cupcake with tassels dangling from my sleeves who doesnt love tassels this is just a ve,1
303,Although i find a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater buy it i bought a size medium which fits me exactly it is an offwhite which is what i wanted i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt for the sweater dress look it is comfortable and versatilealso with a jacket,1
304,This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall im and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee i could see it being very flattering on many body types i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side i bought the plumbrown color and am very happy with it,1
305,Very figure flattering i am lbs b chest and size xs is perfect,1
306,I love this dress there are so many different looks you can get just by adjusting the straps or shoulders the material is lightweight and flows with every turn i ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly i did need a little assistance in getting the side zip to go up but once it was on i didnt want to take it off,1
307,I loved the color and style then put them on and didnt take them off they are so comfortable cane believe it they are going to be my fall staple,1
308,I was surprised how much i like this shirt the fit is really pleasing at first i thought it would be a whatever shirt but i think i will actually wear it a lot more it will look cute dressed up with a cute necklace and flats the price is a bit high for this top but i felt it was worth it since it is so hard finding a casual shirt thats not your basic tee,1
309,Really this top feels like a wonderfully expensive soft silk knit it is just so very soft the drape is really nice and there is stretch to it making it very comfortable it does have a tendency to fall towards the body even though its loose so id buy your regular sizeits a thin material but i dont think its sheer at all i bought the dark redwine color and its so classy i love it this will fit taller women easily because the arms and total length are on the long side i sup,1
310,This robe is warm soft and i like how long it is its perfect length my favorite thing to wear around the house,1
311,Really wanted to luv this top buttt it ran small in arm length in the front bottombackside was perfect coveragealso most important this top is seethrough item as pictured is not accurate,0
312,I ordered this on a whim and didnt expect to like it as much as i do it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual the back is all lace in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami which also helps with the low cut in the front it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo the top is also well made,1
313,Ill admit that i often believe you pay for the design aesthetics at retailer but not necessarily the quality however this dress happily has both the fabrication and lacework on this dress are beautifully made and the price tag fits i do think the sizing is off im b and the medium my usual size was huge small was still gaping under the arms and xs fit perfectly i havent worn an xs in anything since middle school ha the banding at the bust does make it tight so i can we,1
314,I love these pants first they are super flattering for a new mom the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over second they are versatile you can pair them with pointed flats boots or casual with sneakers i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater also normally i am an xl especially for length but the large fit perfectly i didnt want to say that they ran large because they arent too loose,1
315,This is a beautiful dress however it looked awful on me i ordered the medium and it was huge also i looked months pregnant not a good style for the short person,0
316,What can i say its like wearing a hug its so wonderful i have a hard time taking it off at the end of the day its extraordinarily soft and thick and stylish to boot the one thing is that the thread holding the pockets together was already coming unraveled when i took it out of the package and i had to sew them back on right away as they were starting to come completely apart a small price to pay for being a new owner of the best thing ever,1
317,I absolutely love this top ordered the moss color in size xxs i am lbs i typically wear xs and in retailer clothing this top is kinda flaredloose fitting so i would size down the website currently says its by everleigh but the tag says eri ali color is a little darker in person but tie dye effect is spot on its beautiful and super super comfy i am currently wearing it with my lululemons but can defin see this top being dressed up with a cute pendant necklace and skinny bla,1
318,Im small and lbsand the petite xxs fits really well the fabric feels soft too i cant wait for warmer weather so i can wear this,1
319,This top is gorgeous in person i got the small because at pounds and a f chest you never know how a top will fit however this one is big i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out ill be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and theres a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it,1
320,This lovely number met all my expectations ordered an xl and glad i did the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out if it was available in another classic color or a subtle neutral pattern id probably purchase a second one hint hint retailer,1
321,I love this dress its a lightweight soft fabric the blue layer is a bit thin so you can see the stripped layer underneath which keeps this from being just an ordinary blue dress usually im a size xs but got a because i was worried it would be too tight in the shoulders based on another similar dress from holding horses the two fits great the top and waist fit perfect and the bottom is nice and flowy without being too much fabric,1
322,I bought this top in the blue motif and loved it so so very much until i washed it it came out of the wash delicatecold cycle with small holes i am devastated because it was destined to be my favorite top for summer it is flattering lightweight gorgeous color cool raw edges vback detaili could go on and on about all the things i love about this top but now it has holes after one washing so its all for naught doover please with better fabric qa,0
323,Super soft shorts i ordered them in the orange and its a lovely soft orange they arent too short about mid thigh i found the to be a little loose on the waist but i was afraid to compromise the length for a size i may order the navy in,1
324,This dress would have been gorgeous and consistent with retailers aesthetic if the designs had been embroidered onto a thick silkjacquard fabric to give it texture which is how it looks from the photo obviously it would have been more expensive but in any case this was just a really expensive polyester dress which it says in the product description but i gave retailer the benefit of the doubt thinking if anyone can make even polyester look like a quality product itll be retailer but now i,0
325,This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture color is very close too i normally wear a top sometimes s sometimes m the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back i love this jacket though the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it,1
326,The sweater looked different on each model so i wasnt sure what to expect luckily it fitted me similar to the one i was hoping it would the cream sweater model im and got a size small i like that it hangs just past my hips and the long sleeves also the vneck isnt too low so i dont have to wear a camisoleits very cozy and doesnt itch,1
327,Swing dresses can be so iffy but this one is fantastic i sized down to an xs due to the chest area im usually a s up top b and it fits perfectly the dress is so comfortable and stylish without feeling like youre wearing a tent this is the most ive ever spent on a casual dress and it is worth ever penny could not be more happy with my purchase,1
328,Mine was slightly tight across the bust area but im able to leave it open with a light tank underneath it still looks great,1
329,This is a beautiful shirt i purchased the top in navy the silver touch is pretty i usually wear a size or and m was perfect tts great for work or casual party,1
330,I ordered this in a size s my usual size and it fits great i love the color style and fit of the dress the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of ever so slightly poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets other than that its pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler because of the rich color i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall,1
331,This dress is to die for its exactly as pictured beautiful quality and extremely flattering all the lace and lining make it a slightly heavier dress i can imagine it getting really warm after a while in the summer sun but it would absolutely be worth the bit of sweat to wear this gorgeous dress,1
332,This tunic is a wonderfully updated look its cinched just a tad at the waist which gives it a great line i paired it with a pair of citizens of humanity crop jeans terrific look,1
333,This dress is gorgeous in person it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well what you cant see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way i am lbs and curvy for reference i ordered the and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut wish i had gotten a but now they are sold,1
334,I bought the dress that has the cream skirt with large flowers i wore it for a wedding and was not only very comfortable with the pockets and the cotton top i looked good i got a lot of compliments on the outfit people thought it was a shirt and blouse rather than a dress i loved the high low skirt the sizing was accurate and the dress is easy to clean,1
335,This dress is great the fit is perfect and very flattering the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress looks great with flip flops sandals wedges or booties will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress,1
336,This outfit was online for months with no review so i was skeptical to order but very glad i did as it is better in person it is beautiful high quality tommy bahama inspired suit i am so short shorts are risky even though i am a typical size or i took a in the blazer and i am typically a high or low in size so i would say the blazer is very true to size i took the size in the shorts as i felt they ran small and i wanted the extra length they ride a bit lower on my waist an,1
337,My absolute favorite dress yet from retailer i wore it to numerous events this past summer and felt like glad its on sale now for others to snatch up,1
338,I have the blue version i love the bold pop art pattern the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top,1
339,I fell in love the first time i saw it the xs is the perfect fit i generally wear xss or in dresses its not too snug to wear over a thin to medium thickness sweater its a good length also not too long which i struggle with given my height of the s was overall too big its not itchy though ive only worn it with long sleeve tops its just the right weight not too thin and not too heavy its feminine and fun wonderful topper for jeans pants or a dress the color is versatile sl,1
340,Such an amazing shirt to dress down for a long day at school,1
341,These are such quirky pants theyre a lot of fun well made and i love the wide cropped legs they do run small though most reviewers say they are true to size i wear a or and in these i had to get a size very tight at the waist even though the rest of the pant flows easily and is loose great color theyll be perfect for spring and fall and you can probably pair with boots in the winter just a fun staple to my wardrobe,1
342,Im months preggars and this top actually compliments my belly extremely comfortable,1
343,Absolutely gorgeous i never have been a yellow person but today i am converted all the colors are vibrant and true to the photo im and the length is perfect for flat sandals and my wedges so i can dress it up or be stunningly casual i range from lxl in retailer dresses the size is dictated by my broad shoulders since this one is sleeveless i went with the large and its perfect the nude slip has clasps to keep the straps in place and its adjustable the slip is als,1
344,I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear,1
345,I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great fitted at the shoulder loose below it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories,1
346,I bought this during the off dress sale but alas it is a chemise and not a dress nevertheless i love it in a smaller size i exchanged an xs for an xxs it is much more flattering and has more shape the different fabrics make it interesting and fun,1
347,These pants have quickly become my go to spring pant comfortable and a long enough crop for my legs almost closer to the ankle which i prefer i wore them times with out washing and they did stretch out a bit but there is a set of buttons in the hip if i really needed them tighter there i bought the darker color its a mossy greengrey it looks sharp with the tla black vneck t shirt,1
348,Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts decided this summer i would have patterns and color this is a great tshirt nice weight pretty pattern i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly an xs probably would be good too but i hate having my favorite tshirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger,1
349,Was going to order this top in orange but could not decide what size i am either a large or xl i found that the top was in stock in a local retailer in white and went to try it for size first the top is huge i tried the large on and it fit me across the bust and shoulders nicely the rest of the top was like a large tent the white is an off white and really is not attractive looking in fact in the store it was displayed with a jacket over it online the orange looks completely different,0
350,I love this sweater its sort of like a tunic and sort of like a vest i am pairing it with leggings and a white long sleeve tee underneath im lbs and the xs fit very well i love the versatility and design of this,1
351,Im so happy i decided to take a chance and order this top it is gorgeous so flattering on the perfect length beautiful colors i could go on and on peplums can be tough but this one hits perfectly on me runs true to retailer sizing so stick with what you normally order im and lb and the s was for me,1
352,Bypassed this blouse online but its striking colors caught my eye at the store bought the olive green color and its gorgeous the color is great for both spring and fall im normally a petite xs at feet and pounds the regular xs is a great fit for me not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist material is lighweight and flowey dont hesitate to buy its a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans,1
353,The color is deep coral and perfect for fall to top jeans or leggings i love the big slouchy look so the drapey quality is a plus,1
354,Beautiful dress the pics online do not do any justice i got compliments all day,1
355,I bought this dress to wear at a bridal shower and absolutely love it the color was perfect and the petitexs was true to its size the top was a bit on the tight side with my arms but overall incredibly comfortable i would buy more in this style and size but not having enough occasions to wear the style its great for wedding guests cocktail hours or even work,1
356,These are fabulous pants they can easily be worn to work best jeanspants ever for women with no butts they stay up and theyre comfortable i cant speak highly enough for these dont ever stop making them retailer,1
357,This skirt is so cute the fix print is really nice its a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe,1
358,I ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work unfortunately it is poorly made i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart after closely inspecting the cause i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together so the minute you put it on one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f,0
359,Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks makes a great and comfortable work outfit,1
360,Great style and fit will look great with jeans skirt or leggings,1
361,When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that but i did not expect it cause it wasnt as obvious in the online photos it is much more prominent in personi ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly just like the model definitely oversized but appropriately so the length was also great im which made me very happy,1
362,Purchased these in the blue motif love the hei hei silky pull on pants i got hooked on them last summer and was thrilled to see them for the upcoming spring they run true to size they are beyond comfortable and wear well everyone should have at least one pair of these comfy pants in their closet dress them up down or wear them to the office versatility and comfort what more could you ask for,1
363,I love this dresssophisticated and amazingfabulous fabric however if you are petite and take a it will be enormous i am trying to decide if i send it back or have it altered,1
364,I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smallerit runs very generous and so the sizing is a little offthe style and quality are beautiful so i am anxious to receive the smaller size,1
365,So comfy and stylish love the color i purchased the indigoblue nice fit relaxed fitnot fitted might have to get another color its fun to have a tee with a different design detail neckline im lbs and ordered the medium a smaill probably would have worked too since my shoulders are a bit narrow but mediumd is fine,1
366,I walked into a hair salon wearing this dress and everyone who walked by complimented me to me thats a definite winner i got the blue color and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should theres no static or clinging where there shouldnt be i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off but i absolutely love it,1
367,This coat is absolutely beautiful the fabric is soft and almost silky and the style is timeless i ordered an xs and it fits true to size and has excellent quality,1
368,I love that this tee is so soft and is not boring when i originally took it out of the bag my teenage daughter did not like it then i tried it on and she was wowed the longer length in the back makes it very interesting i am looking forward to wearing this with jeans,1
369,How could this not be flattering to every figure bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections i know i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now this paired with a darker color and not black yay makes for a perfect combination in a dress i love that this is a deep purple it is a dark color which is slimming but in addition it has more appeal being colored and it is so versatile wear it along or with a cardiganjacket on top heels or boo,1
370,In accordance with other reviewers the pictures dont do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice the fabric has threads of gold silver and black that together make for shimmery elegancenot at all the heather grey in the photo im b and the xs regular fits perfectand actually more slimmingfit than in the photo sleeves are longwhich i love a keeper especially on sale,1
371,Ive been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger im glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl they are really sweater tights i think this aspect is great but they do not have as much give as other tights i am petite about lbs and the small,1
372,Have been on the hunt for decent shorts all summer as an elder i need some length comfort style and attractive fit these meet all the criteria im and got the s theyre lightweight but substantial enough to keep their shape love the faux cuff too they stretched a bit but still have a perfect fit got the grey on sale and getting more in other colors left in my size at full price so good,1
373,I absolutely love this dress when i wear it i feel so graceful and pretty the belt allows you to tie it so that if your weight fluctuates up or down it still looks great i think im going to be wearing this dress all summer love love love i think my only quibble would be that the lining on the inside fits more snugly than the dress itself and when i was walking it rode up its like a stretchy mesh type material but im carrying a few more pounds than id like right now once i lo,1
374,I just bought this and i really disagree with previous review that it runs big i wear an in skirts and bought another retailer skirt last week that fits just fine this one does not even zip up i might exchange for bigger size as label is just a number to me and sizes are really inconsistent or it may just go back,0
375,I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around the back has mesh strips that are see through there is also no lining to go with this skirt if you go back to the back view picture on the website and zoom in closely you can see the models black underwear,0
376,I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress it did not appear as it did on the photo i was pretty disappointed by the color the photo of the dress is much more impressive,0
377,Love this dress beautiful,1
378,Ordered the grey colored capris they fit great i am lbs and the size fits me comfortably ive recently been making a transition into more comfortable looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans these are great still figure flattering but comfortable and well made the detail on the button section is lovely also,1
379,Beautiful dress i love this and am tempted to buy it in more colors fits true to size in a flattering way love the cut of the back and the flow of the bottom,1
380,I love this tunic the fit is just lovely for meim a large busted muscular shouldered woman who wears a on the bottom the fit perfectly across my chest ddd without horrid gaping armpits and the gathered back gives just enough extra fabric so that the buttons do not pull at all in frontnot easy to achieve in a button down for a big chested girl i also love the cut and flowit is fabulous and hip with skinny jeans and platform heels but also cute with flat sandals for a day o,1
381,Usually the whole boho style looks funny on me but the cut and print were subtle enough for me to pull it off the colors are beautiful probably flattering against any hair or skin tonesi took my usual small because the shoulders were generous enough word of caution this is dry clean only,1
382,These are fantastic great fit super comfortable material and perfect length petite i ordered the carbon to have a neutral pair but i also want the other colors p fit in waist lbs length on petite is enough to have a small heel i have short legs,1
383,Love this shirt it fits great and can be easily layered,1
384,These are so comfy mom of two boys on the go great for running around and then can be dressed up for a night out on the town not mom jeans,1
385,This shirt is very attractive i tried on my usual size and it fits like a glove i wish they had more colors than ivory but i couldnt pass up the unique fit and design of this shirt,1
386,A wardrobe addition to dress up or dress downthe sheer sleeves are a nice detailim and the length hits me at the knee,1
387,I love this dress i found it to run one size big i am lbs and went down a size to a i purchased both a and then tried them on a few times and the smaller size didnt pull at all because it fit me right the larger one hung lower and didnt look right i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch very comfortable too,1
388,I may wear these every day i am obsessed i am ibs normally a size in jeans i ordered these in a and they fit like a glove they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel i am extremely happy with this purchase these are a must have staple in anyones wardrobe,1
389,I was very hesitant to purchase this with such a high price tag but i just received it in the mail and it is absolutely beautiful feels and looks high quality and i cant wait to pair it with the top the model is wearing in the photos definitely worth it,1
390,I purchased this jacket in a pxs as i am and lbs the sleeve length is perfect the fabric is soft and lightweight which is perfect for living in southern california i dont feel any itchiness either the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem which add nicely to the look i like how the sleeves are ribbed giving it a comfy sweater feel theres also two zippered pockets whic,1
391,Beautiful white denim pants the fit is perfect fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom very classy and versatile cut paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception will be getting them hemmed but i dont mind because they are perfect,1
392,Perfect spring transition piece saffron yellow but medium weight and breathable this color is in for spring and the perfect blend for a not too warm cover up,1
393,I love this top of course i love most things that are denim or look like denim this is a fun twist on a denim shirt the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional,1
394,Dont try this on if you dont plan to buy it it feels amazing i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much,1
395,This dress drapes beautifully and fits tts i purchased the green colour in a petite small for reference i am and lbs rather than feeling clingy this dress skims the body and hides trouble spots while highlighting everything i like about myself for that reason i went ahead and paid full price with no regrets looks fantastic with black tights and black ankle boots or bare legs with cowboy booties highly recommend,1
396,I love these shorts i usually have a really hard time finding shorts that fit my pearshape but these are great i bought in a few different colors and i definitely will get a lot of use out of them this summer,1
397,Quality was not what you expect from retailer especially for the price top is lined but skirt is not material is tissue paper thin and see thru there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat it keeps popping up however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives was returned,0
398,I absolutely love this sweater its soft easy to wash and looks great,1
399,Love this top pretty details and true to size fit,1
400,I tried this on in the store on a whim it is so flattering soft and pretty i generally wear a size and bought a l although the m might have fit also its got plenty of room the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed my dimensions are about bust x waist,1
401,Omg so i never pay full price for a tshirt because its just a tshirt but there are exceptions for every rule i cant believe i am saying this but this shirt was worth it it is true to size a relaxed fit so if you are in between sizes you could comfortably size down the colors are just so darling love this not disappointed,1
402,I purchased the one marked with the red dot the one with the larger pattern and orange in it i spied it in the store as soon as it arrived i fell absolutely in love with it immediately i am normally xl but this piece runs large so i tried the l and its perfect very bohemian which i adore first time out i folded over the top and wore it as pants and it looked fabulous with a black top it can also be worn the way it is shown i have also belted it and worn it with a black jacket as show,1
403,I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me however go up a size if you have any breasts at all likely they will not fit in you standard size however i just love this shirt soooo adorable the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic,1
404,Love the fit and feel of the fabric says to dry but i found the leg seams did bunch up a bit so next time i wont dry them ill hang to dry very cute style super comfy,1
405,Ordered this in the orange black white and turquoise print in both a small and medium the style is cute and i like the high neckline that shows off the shoulders and swing skirt that falls beautifully and hides a multitude of figure problems i also previously bought the emerson swing dress which is the same style by maeve the emerson style ran a bit larger and as the reviews there state the armholes were a bit long so i ended up with a small in that one this lilt swing dress howev,1
406,Perfect fit though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami i absolutely recommend this shirt it fits tts,1
407,This dress is as cute as i hoped it would be i love the pockets and length and flattering cut it looks great with boots and is perfect for fall only con is that it is dry clean only it seems like the fabric would do just fine with hand washing and i will probably go for it i just dont have the patience or organization for dry cleaning,1
408,Great summer skort these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on it does run slightly large i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo,1
409,Im so pleased with this cropped chino with all its lovely colors i have bought colors so far and i love the fit and comfort of these im pounds and took the p since this runs a size large my favorite is the lovely moss color which really a brighter mint green and i also love the honey color for spring and summer these fit slightly slim yet still feel relaxed love them and highly recommend these,1
410,I love the neckline with the pleated ruffles and tie its graceful and distinctive yet still understated,1
411,Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each i usually wear a medium or large so id say it fits super true to size just depends on how you want it to fit,1
412,This dress is very beautiful and looks great on however had to downsize one size,1
413,Ive gotten many compliments with this delightful dress colors ar light and just right for a summer day so comfortable and has a nice inner lining very light and comfortable,1
414,I recently bought this blouse the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful love it,1
415,Too much fabric not a flattering top for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are,0
416,Its rare to find such a great skirt flattering unique design substantial denimlike fabric something with pockets this skirt has everything including an adjustable buckled waist i love the slight aline shape too for me it fits true to size the same size i wear in skirts from other brands i love the colors ivory background cobalt periwinkle orange blush pink yellow black it will be easy to pair with tees or buttondown shirts and cute sandals,1
417,I wasnt sure about the color but ordered based on how much my stylist loved it my usual xs petite fits perf daly no chest problem dd and the length is quite nice romantic look the drawstring in the back helps making sure the dress fits properly at the waist it is a high low style with flowy skirt overall great i need to stop going to the store,1
418,I wanted this dress in the turquoise motif but it sold out so quickly i tried on about dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner i got the blue and white motif which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over or the skirt flying up in the breeze or needing a strapless bra the skirt flows really nicely and over,1
419,Im so incredibly disappointed the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing poor quality control,0
420,I tried this on in store in blue and its so comfortable its just the right level of loose to be flattering for me the cap sleeves were a little strange they just didnt sit in a way that was flattering or seemed purposefulnot sure if that was the design or my body,1
421,I love this top i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel i am petite and it fits great,1
422,Love this poncho purchased xs in goldolive color and the length is good i could have sized up for extra length but thought there was too much fabric in body for reference slender love the diagonal cable pattern and curved design the sleeves are more comfortable for me pushed up a little but if left long works well and are about wrist length the color is great for fall but could easily transition into winterspring the gray is a lighter gray and is nice too but size xs not availab,1
423,I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color it is so beautiful and feminine i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available online i bought it in a size and i am d i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine,1
424,This is a go with everything throw on sweater coat that is very soft and flattering on the fit is true to size for a swing coat being a heather black helps with the no show of lint i will wear this no doubt for years to come thanks retailer,1
425,I love this skirt fits great snug but comfortable and the length is perfect for wearing with ankle strap sandals the material is soft and hangs nicely my new favorite skirt i am and curvy got the large which was perfect for my fuller figure,1
426,I love this tunic the knit is soft and comfortable and very easy to wear i purchased moss and can change the look of the outfit by adding various accessories the slits on the side are cut rather high and i have found that jeans or leggings of a thicker fabric look best,1
427,This is by far my favorite romper it is very flattering and the material feels wonderful against the skin,1
428,These are the most comfortable happening pants i have ever owned they are extremely flattering and slimming at the waist i am a size and bought the and they fit perfectly they are a bit long but after washing and drying on low mine shrunk enough that i can wear them with flats or flip flops and not just heels my teenage daughters have complimented me on them saying how modern they look i bought them in navy and just ordered the grey yesterday i might go into my local store and,1
429,I found this instore when looking for a dressy slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding im really happy with it the aline cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesnt feel like im hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted the flowy hemline offsets the short length maybe above the knee for me the pink color is very light lighter than in the photos i think but it will work nicely for the wedding as the first reviewer sai,1
430,I fell in love with this online and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic although i am not usually into pink this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc cant wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it for reference i am c chest and the small fit perfect the quality is really high end as well,1
431,Didnt like at all itchy fabric looked good on model but on on busty girl,0
432,This top is fun in a soft fabric i got the navy ad bright great for summer but top does run large i usually get a medium but sized down to a small,1
433,This dress is absolute perfection the quality of the dress is great the fit is comfortable and its such a fun summer dress the slip underneath fits perfectly the outer layer is delicate yet durable,1
434,I saw this in my local store and i fell in love with the bird pattern flowing down the right side of the shirt for me i bought the xs and the fit was great i usually take a true s the sleeves have a pulled stitching running down them and the top has nice shaping and flare to it it is a wonderful little tee the fabric is linen and not as soft as cotton but in this case it is not an issue as the tee does not cling to you,1
435,I love this dress so much the fabric on top is not something i would have chosenit is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one otherwise you would have to go with a straplessand the right kind of strapless with this dresswhen they say it flares it really doesand much more than i was expecting the bottom part of the skirt f,1
436,Love the look love the fit for both professional and casual looks,1
437,Great fit and very cute design goes great with jeans,1
438,I bought the white version of this beautiful top in the store yesterday this romantic top is beautifully detailed very soft comfortable and flattering there is a thin cotton liner underneath too fits true to size with enough room in the bust to not be too tight,1
439,Agree with other reviewers that the sweater might swallow you up unless you are tall its soft not itchy well made comfy and stylish i want it to get cold out so i can wear it,1
440,These bottoms are comfortable soft and fit perfectly the pattern is exactly the colors online,1
441,This is one you just need to see in person stunning detailed embroidery everywhere gracefully oversized very bohemian light airy and dreamy this kimono was mine the second i saw it white on white is classicand this cream embroidery is beautiful the kimono is very oversized im normally a l or xl and this was plenty roomy its also quite long nearly came down to my knees and im around if there is an option for petite id recommend it to shorter gals cant wait to pair this w,1
442,This dress is very lovely ivory fits as pictured slightly below knee in ivory not as the black is depicted much shorter fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy,1
443,Ive been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect as another reviewer said they are in fact seethrough because they are meant to be a cover up not real shorts the hem detail is very cute and theyre super comfortable my size small fit tts and the hem is nice for tall women,1
444,This is such a cute top it runs largei bought an xs and usually wear a small or medium its flowy and comfy looks great with dark jeans,1
445,Better than the picture right chest neck line not too low comfortable material and the cut is just right bought two in different color,1
446,This is a fabulous style top highly recommend this top comfortable material retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style,1
447,I own this shirt in dark greennavy and whiteit is perfect it drapes in such a flattering way nice weightit shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug emphasizing every flawand finally the buttons are placed perfectly so that you dont have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative bra showingwell done,1
448,Soft comfortable material love the carbon color great everyday casual tee but with a nice bit of detaili liked it so much that i ordered a second one,1
449,First of all this is so much prettier in person if i were looking online i would have scrolled right by this beauty i am usually a medium or small in retailer tops and dresses in jeans i am a size or but i always have to get the waist taken in little waist big thigh problem this piece was tricky for me but i ended up with a medium because the legs are so roomy also there are little ties on the sides to pull in the waist more if necessary the scarf can also be tied behind the neck,1
450,It is seldom that i write a review about a tee but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today i just felt compelled to do so the deal is this tee is pricey for sure but in my opinion it is worth it as another reviewer said the cotton fabric is hefty in fact it could also be called a lightweight sweater everything about this tee is perfect and classic the elbow sleeves the nice neckline and the semiboxy semicropped fit it will go with everything from jeans to nice slacks,1
451,I love this skirt as a fan of different textures and pretty things this piece exceeded my expectations i am always a size or in retailer dresses and the fits like a glove the length is perfect just above the knee ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick neoprene material ive adored the feel of it everything feels firm and put together the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic it will pair well with lots of different tops too,1
452,I have two of these tops the maroon and tan and white stripe the material is great and the neckline lays great it isnt too thick so i can wear it on cooler florida days you can dress it up under a jacket or dress down with some jeans,1
453,I got the green one as the other reviewers commented yes the fabric is thin however i wear it with a nude bra and a nude cami and ive had nothing but compliments,1
454,Just received these and they fit perfectly but the panels are different shades of gray the color is not consistent and it make them look bad they are perfect otherwise but sadly they are not wearable i will be returning,0
455,I would highly recommend this top it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas much prettier than the picture depicts i am very happy with this purchase cant wait to wear with black or white capris this summer,1
456,Although it may not look like it takes on a shape what a wonderfully flattering jumper was intrigued from seeing it in the catalog and had to try it on in the store i was unsure how the middle would appear but it fit wonderfully feminine looking forward to the summer,1
457,Cute top a little delicate my top arrived with a rip in the sleeve fortunately my tailor was able to fix it,1
458,Unique vest modern chic i especially like the color block one the collar part i know it will become a staple in my working clothes and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes i dont think the back of this vest is of bad quality like another reviewer said overall its a hightquality piece,1
459,This is my favorite jumpsuit purchase of the season flattering casual look well made light material easy to dress up or down cant wait to wear it again,1
460,These leggings are gorgeous soft suede feel perfect fit great look especially for dressing up and going out love them,1
461,Purchased for myself and loved the fabric and unique design it runs very large and the size smaller was not available so it was returned,1
462,This top is really pretty i love the details on the back tail of the shirt the colors in this shirt are really pretty more like a peachy pink to me i will however line dry this shirt because of the different fabric on the tail of the shirt i would not iron that portion of the shirt either overall i am completely in love with this shirt it will be a staple in my closet,1
463,Incredibly soft and comfortable not as fitted as i would like this often happens to me with skinny pants though i want to wear these guys everyday,1
464,Love the pockets and back of dress the buttons on the the straps allow for them to be adjusted thats a plus im with an athletic build at d the medium fits perfect,1
465,Such a cute jean got these specifically for the tie up lace ankle and price also love the shade of gray i bought,1
466,The perfect summer pants i will be ordering more colors and possibly a smaller size i think the slim fit would look just as good in a less slouchy size i bought a size petite in the dark blue not navy and they fit perfect and the color is amazing very high quality feel very soft and comfy for reference im curvy lbs usual size is a but ive recently been losing weight so my sizing may be off the pants do stretch out like most pilcro chinos,1
467,This button down is to die for the material is incredibly soft and comfy it looks great with my retailer leggings and is also a great look with my casual denim paired with a cardi and flats or booties ive worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it definitely a headturning piece,1
468,I saw this dress and loved everything about it i was so sad when i tried it on and it was just too big they were out of the smaller size so i had to return it the dress is well made and the color is just a bit neon compared to the picture,0
469,The images definitely do not do the jacket justice the detail is beautiful and the fabric is unexpected and quite luxurious,1
470,Its no surprise that this sweater coat is getting five stars its beautifully made has a fun pattern and fits greati purchased the xs regular size there werent any of the petite sizes left for me but the xs fits perfectly the sleeves hit at my wrist im while the length hits right at the top of my knees i did notice that the shoulder width could be too tight if you are a more broad personthe colors are accurate to the website and catalog this seems so extremely versatile,1
471,If i could wear this top every single day i would this is the white flowy top ive been dreaming of but better the fabric is so lightweight and breathable i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf skinny jeans ankle boots or on a hot summer day with shortsskinnies and sandals you can dress it up or down be aware that the chest hem is at a nontraditional height not quite above or below the breasts however i think it looks flattering on both smallchested and busty women,1
472,I get a lot of compliments on this dress its bright and cheerful for sure it runs maybe a bit large but is a great summer dress,1
473,This is an absolutely beautiful dress but arrived with several holes in it,0
474,I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair,1
475,This is a beautiful and classic blouse great fit and flow however the silk is very light and the snap falls off easily tricky to sew back on since the fabric is so delicate,1
476,Not flattering and not the color it appears online this is really a pink shirt,0
477,I love this sweater i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasnt sure if it would be too bulky it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice thankfully i washed it and the smudge came out i live in houston tx and dont need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth this is mostly cotton it is well made the sleeves were longer on me than the model,1
478,I just purchased this cute dress on sale and made sure to size down one size so instead of my regular small i ordered an extra small which fits me perfectly im a petite yet busty d and and think the dress looks adorable on especially since im a huge fan of all things plaid its a lighter weight dress so its perfect for spring or summer but can be worn in fallwinter with this color scheme by adding tights boots and a sweater or jacket i also love that it has pockets i dont,1
479,I ordered a medium as i like my shirts a bit loose it is a beautiful shirt and looks great in person however this shirt is cut more wide and short than it is long and lean exchanged for a small,1
480,This top is the very same top meadow rue had a couple of years ago i have that top and it is identical so my guess is meadow rue and deletta are owned by the same company,1
481,This top is so pretty and feminine the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves the fit is true to size i usually wear a size medium or in retailer tops and the size fit quite nicely this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well,1
482,Im an xl in retailer tops and purchased this in the size xl it fits very nicely not tight i usually have problems with peplum blouses hitting me oddly since i have a short waist but this fit beautifully i like the feel of the high quality fabric the color green works so well with my red hair i highly recommend this blouse,1
483,I assumed at the price point this would be a high quality tshirtsweater unfortunately it is made of cheap looking material that is acrylic and seethrough,0
484,Do not waste your money on thisat first i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it so i bought this pants in store too i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless i was so shock fyi i did not use bleach or chrolox i mean i dont use themi will return them bothstill mad this is bad quality enough worth it,0
485,I tried this top on in the store and didnt buy it because i was in a hurry obsessed about it and it was sold out when i went back so happy i was able to get it online its beautiful i got a medium and it fits perfectly enough room that it hangs nicely but not baggy im typically a medium in shirts at retailer it looks beautiful with high waisted black pants i wear a cami underneath i own it in white and tried it on with a black bra only and it looked great i just didnt feel comfortable,1
486,I bought about dresses online in an attempt to find a few dresses for derby week in kentucky this was one of the that made the cut im usually a and i bought a it fit like it was tailor made for me i questioned if it was too tight at first but decided it was just right and felt great in it for a full day at the track it was comfy it almost felt like it had built in spanx i didnt have to wear a bra and it gave me great lift almost like a bustier i got so many compliments mu,1
487,This sweater coat is really cute and soft i hate itchy sweaters the blue is lovely and the cut is flattering im going to check it out in other colors as well,1
488,I looooove these the styling makes me wonder if i could even wear them to work on casual fridays with the right top they are so great i am a little concerned about how they will hold up over time since some of the stitching looks a little shoddy but they are still worth it at this price i am going to order another pair just in case they dont hold up i love them that much,1
489,I love this sweater as others have mentioned its not the softest acrylic in the world but i can overlook that for the simple fact that its adorable i like the cropped fit pairs perfectly with high waisted jeansskirts the embroidery has a sort of handmade feel to it without looking cheap the slit up only one side makes it unique in my opinion i did expect it to be a bit heavier but its a great layering piece and ideal for transitioning into colder weather i may be biased because of,1
490,Love these level pants newport style dress them up or down wearing mine today with a moth top i also got at a looking kind of s chic light jeans for a hot day,1
491,So unflattering really disappointed made me look month pregnant and im a petite size,0
492,When i saw this online i immediately put it on my must buy list i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon luckily my bm store had it and i am so glad i didnt waste my money or time ordering it online this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark what the product shot online doesnt show is that it has dol,0
493,Nice top you can dress it up or down runs very large i had to exchange sizes twice my regular top size is but end up buying size,1
494,I love my new maxi dress as soon as i put it on i knew this dress would be my go to dress of the summer i love the styling with the thicker shoulder straps and higher cleavage you will definitely be able to wear a regular bra with this dress the material is soft light and flows well i particularly love the ruffle on the bottom of the dress it adds that extra little feminine touch i cant wait to wear it,1
495,Great versatile skirt very flattering,1
496,This one will be going back the color is really blah and the fabric wasnt a texture i was expectingit is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day overall the cut and style is cute but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric,0
497,So flattering on my curvy and busty body so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are not the case with this top the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully so flattering imo i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous cant wait to wear,1
498,First thing i would say these pants run large im a size the size fit perfect i love the style and look of the cascade fabric on leg of these pants but these pants are a little heavy still a beautiful pant,1
499,Beautiful top that will go with anything looking forward to wearing it,1
500,I got the red it is a great color this is one of those thin soft t shirts it drapes really nicely and dresses up or dresses down the only downside for me is that it takes a little extra effort in the washing department but really not much just have to line dry,1
501,I purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey i love them both but the grey is by far my fave this is a nice soft beautiful tee the burst of flowers are just adorable i found these ran tts on me cute little top and such a good deal at sale price,1
502,Im about lbs and ordered a size the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all i probably would wear a instead of the but could tell that even if i had the the cut of it still wouldnt be flattering on me at all it was baggy in odd places and had no shape the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice with a fitted slip design,0
503,This dress fits beautifully it is warm and comfortable winters gem,1
504,I love this sweater because it is an edge to it fit is true to size and its soft and confortable,1
505,I ordered the correct size due to reading other reviews who gave their height weight and chest size thank you all for that i am feet inches tall and fluctuate between lbs and lbs i wear b in bras i ordered an fits great the coverage is adequate on my backside the rouching is very nice in the mid section for self conscious women like me the color is fun and beautiful the quality is excellent i love the bra support there are real bra cups sewn in it was pricey bu,1
506,Pros this skirt is a stunner beautiful rich color and great quality the cut is conservative enough to be work appropriate but the little peek of abovetheknee leg where the slit is makes it interesting and flattering as wellcons slightly smelly when it comes out of the bag im optimistic this will mostly go away though expensivefit im lbs b normally wear a or in pants and the size fit great i often wear a size in skirts despite a size fitting fine in,1
507,Im so glad i tried this dress on to see how lovely it is definitely a keeper,1
508,I had been looking for a chambray shirt but am not a fan of the typical buttondown style this shirt is very versatile but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it the material is incredibly soft but i havent laundered it yet so i am not sure how it will holdup,1
509,This is a beautiful shirt like many other reviewers stated this shirt does not have a lining but any white camisole works just fine love it ive already gotten tons of compliments,1
510,For cat lovers in particular these socks will grab your attention they are fine quality ankle socks the kittens are really more moss green than beige,1
511,I love this tshirt it is so soft fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors,1
512,I love this incredibly soft fabric its well designed and very flattering i am tall with a large bustline dresses can be difficult as the waistline usually hits in the wrong spot but not this dress its hits the spot and the highlo hemline flatters my legs bought this to wear to hawaii paired with a panama hat and a pair of flatform sandels,1
513,Im lbs d i bought the medium i think i could have gotten the small but i didnt have time to reorder it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half i love the length and the fabric,1
514,The colors and design are stunning in person it is onesize and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing and not fitted i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings i love the idea of layering this over shorts i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit coverup the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it also really pops over simple black leggings and black top its light an,1
515,Really flattering cut this shirt is perfect for fall got so many compliments the first time i wore it,1
516,This is a beautiful dress but unfortunately it is only for women who are not well endowed it is extremely well fitted in the chest the high waste also poufs out due to a lot of extra material and the double lining a beautiful dress but a very very poor construction also there are bright blue and yellow beads in the chest area that are a bizarre combo to the corals and browns of the fabric i am normally a at retailer and the was extremely small,0
517,I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru its true had to return it,0
518,Really striking even prettier in person color is beautiful told my husband this is a halfwaytochristmas present,1
519,Great bra fits well works under tighter tshirts just be aware that the straps do clearly read calvin klein more mauve than pink,1
520,Luckily i found this in the store though it is on backorder online so if you really want it go tocall the store its effortless fun beautiful and nicely detailed love this top im and usually wear size and i bought a small really worth the price bc you can just throw it on and look fabulous layers well so happy i got this,1
521,This top is so soft simple and such a closet staple if you get the right size for reference i am lbs and i ordered the petite medium its perfect the black is a great color hard to describe kind of soft with some warm blush tones i also ordered the white and the peach great at the sale price,1
522,I recently bought this is a medium black and it is a perfect fit its a beautiful top and the peplum portion is perfect and long enough for someone with a lon torso for reference im ft lbs and usually wear a or mediumlarge top i went with the medium based on other reviews i i was lucky to find this on sale,1
523,Nothing skinny about these pants theyre very cute great quality but they run a good one size large size down,1
524,Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten i ordered corals one in s one in xs the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s while my arms were loose in the xs keeping the larger than s xs coral the color is just lovely also ordered the ivory in both ps pm keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands for sun protection when i wantneed because you can cinch the waist tightly a looser jacket sti,1
525,Love these basic ts because there is always a unique cut out which makes them more interesting fit and wash well,1
526,I ordered this top in a my usual size and it fits fine but it is way too shortwaisted it looks nothing like what the model is wearing her top comes low on her waist almost to her crotch area mine was just about inches below my belly button it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory very strange,0
527,I really love everything about this cardigan the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot the color is highly versatile it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm and my favorite part is that it is long i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to,1
528,Ive been searching high and low for a pair of flattering and comfortable linen pants im very particular and have turned down every pair until these these are perfect they fit true to size they are a relaxed but not baggy cut i hate saggy butt pants the legs are slightly tapered so they dont widen my frame they look great rolled up or left down the linen is soft not scratchy the elastic band sits comfortably on my waist they are also not see through a must for me i ordered th,1
529,I really wanted to love this dress i love the colors and the design of the dress unfortunately i have to agree with one of the other reviewers that this dress makes you look pregnant its so voluminous that its not flattering at all also agree that the lining is scratchy,0
530,I got this in black with white dots fits great flattering and helps hide middle section,1
531,Okay this shirt is soooo comf it is super fun and flowy but it runs large get one size smaller than you would usually get so worth the sale price,1
532,Adorable too chilly now to wear alone too cute to cover it up my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w it though size fits me perfectly looks pretty much on me as in the pic love plaid cotton blend tops anyways ruffles adorable im not too big on that but do love this look when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd smokylike odor but its the dye i think after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared i have in mind to wear w the pilcr,1
533,This dress hit my waist in a weird spot and was too short i would not have felt comfortable bending over it was a tad too full which wasnt flattering eitheri really wanted to love it bc they design is adorablei need to return it,0
534,I saw this in the store in a display and tried it on i got it in the sky color which is a lavender blue color the front and back are both cute this top can be dressed up or worn with jeans,1
535,Gave this to a friend as a gift soft lovely she loves it,1
536,I purchased this in blue it has a soft fabric and seems well made i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable i bought one size up due to comments on the site but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart,1
537,Great color great length will go perfect with leggings and skinny jeanspants this will work well when the weather transitions and will be super cute under a cardigan when it gets cold,1
538,I received tons of compliments on this adorable jumper and felt like i was wearing comfy pajamas i wore it to a baby shower and it was a hit im and it was a bit long and needed to be hemmed otherwise its perfect,1
539,Based on the mixed reviews about fit i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed im wondering if there are different batches of this dress im and the dress fit as in the photo the side slits come above my knees but not too high arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you the material is cozy and soft the cream color is gorgeous size wise it definitely looks boxy and marshmallowlike if too loose i am usuall,1
540,This was my favorite piece in my order it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors they dont i voice the other reviewers opinion get more colors in of this style i would order in a heartbeat i plan on wearing this to work its freezing in my office but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look the material was soft woven tightly a good thing and well made good one retailer definitely a keeper,1
541,When i saw this online i wondered why this dress cost so much i have been keeping my eye on it for some time loved what i saw the design and colors and details at the neckline and waist along with pockets but was skeptical i was waiting for a sale to take a dive and here are my thoughts when i got itpros the colors you see online are exactly the same in person the jeweled neckline is lovely its one thing that drew me to it this dress had a very sophisticated appeal wh,0
542,This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy looked like a tent on me this one went back the same day it came,0
543,Im another borderline petite at and i loved this the pants are like palazzos on me and i think with a heel it will look great i plan on wearing my hair up and tying the tie in the back in a big bow in fact i dont see the button back spoken of in the description so i think one would have to do so,1
544,Gorgeous with that retailer uniquenessunfortunately this shade of yellow just wasnt right for mebut it is a beautiful dress,1
545,Love this dress sexy but still appropriate very elegant im pounds and the size fit me great it is a little long so i am considering ordering the size petite definitely worth the money,1
546,I got this in the wine which is a beautiful color the design is nice and looks expensive but im not sure how it will hold up the fabric is very nice medium weight and drapes well it is a little boxy but would be nice to layer over a button down,1
547,I was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts unfortunately this fell short as it was huge not only was it big it flared at the bottom it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump but not what i am going for right now if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunicim sad that ill have to return it,0
548,This skirt was very figure flattering and the elastic waist is comfortable and does not cut into my sides has a great look,1
549,I didnt give this dress a second look for the longest time when the summer tag sale came about i decided to pop in and see if i could find a versatile summer dress i was in need of a piece i could easily dress up or down the burnt orange color variation caught my eye first though i also tried on the neutral and it is also fabulous this dress is amazing on i am an hourglass shape size d chest and i tried on both the small and medium the small fit much better on me and i r,1
550,I didnt think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love i am typically a medium and this was true with this i have a dd chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesnt show i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it,1
551,So disappointed i love retailer this was a huge disappointment i am and pounds when i put it on all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look if i wasnt so disappointed i might have laughed this had to have been a design mistake ive truly never seen something so unflattering,0
552,This top is beautifully detailed it is flattering and i am very happy with my purchase,1
553,This is absolutely gorgeous cardigan the pictures dont do it justice its comfortable and soft and very trendy at the same time i bought it in teal and in medium i am and usually wear even though i think it runs tts but for more fitted look medium fits better i am blond and this color looks great i also loved it when unzipped the upper part it looked even better it is perfect with leggings in grey blue green and black also beautiful with aqua flora leggings and with re,1
554,Great with leggingsperfect with cold weather hard to find if you have large calves retailer is only place i could find leg warmers to fit they are nice and thick and warm and true to color,1
555,I have the pineapple dress from last year when i saw this top with the lemons i was in love i dont usually pay this much for a top but i had a special event coming up i searched and searched but nothing compared to the lemon top so with my birthday discount i bit the bullet and ordered it my first thought was that it didnt seem very substantial for the price i decided to keep it though because it is such a unique piece i wore a beige cami underneath along with a beige skirt and it,1
556,Coh emerson style jeans are the best fit and style the pacifica color is a light blue and nice for spring and summer i love the slim boyfriend i have thighs and they fit like a skinny without being super tight there is just enough stretch no holes either they are easy to dress up or down and have become my new favorites,1
557,I meant to order this online and forgot i was very happy when i was able to get it in one of the stores yesterday its everything a summer dress should be flowy lightweight and a great print i cant believe theres no reviews and that it still available in every size for reference i got a small i am this dress i thought would make me look wide because its all straight across but in fact it really has a great flow and is cut well grab it while you can,1
558,Like other reviewers have said this item runs extremely long and large i could have fit my body in one pant leg they were so widemuch wider than any standard wide leg pant ive owned sadly had to return,0
559,Love this dress i think i scored the deal of the year with this one found it in my local retailer store it had been in my save for later forever but i couldnt bring myself to pay full price then it sold out in my size online i was in my local store browsing the new items on sale with the additional off and there it was and only and my size i picked it up noticed the cut outs that are not very apparent in the online photos but it back picked it back up put it back,1
560,I love wearing this sweater it is unbelievably soft and cozy usually a sweater like this sits like an unflattering sack on me so i was pleasantly surprised by how flattering it was on my petite frame i purchased a grey xs regular in store and i am lbs and it was long but not at all overwhelming it sat very flattering on my figure and kept me warm at work on this rainy cold day i wore mine with skinny capri jeans and purple suede kitten heels would look great with leggings and bo,1
561,I fell in love with this vest the minute i saw it on the hanger it runs true to size and the material is excellent quality it looks great with jeans and a tee and also something dressier i wore it over a navy blue wideleg jumpsuit and it looked truly amazing i received so many compliments i also purchased the lace tie up top that it is featured with and cant wait for that to come in,1
562,These are a soft and lightweight material the photos here dont show the tiny beautiful pattern on them look closely through the photos and youll see it way better than a normal pair of black summer pants these are very log so i plan to hem to flats to wear for a more casual look but they have the ability to go either way the pockets flare out a big so im going to have those sewn shut when i do the hemming it is a higher west so great for that look or to wear with some cropped style summ,1
563,Im bought this dress at weeks pregnant and am loving it the top drapes but is still formfitting enough to show off a little bump ive received so many compliments the skirt is short but i love it makes legs look great with tights i sized up a little to allow for room to grow,1
564,This skirt fits in a strange way there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt the elastic looks frumpy unflattering,0
565,I had never worn pilcro jeans and i took a chance and ordered without trying them on i couldnt be more pleased i wear a but it is often difficult to find a good fitting pair of jeans these fit comfortably and dont feel too tight but are fitted enough to look great i like the little bit of extra room around the top allowing the jeans to feel comfortable ill be back for more pilcro jeans,1
566,The lace on this is gorgeous its feminine and elegant and fancy definitely know if peplum style tops work for you before purchasing if you have a large waist it will just make you look bigger but the top portion is nice and fitted so i think its very flattering im c b and got the small fits great,1
567,Beautiful dress i like the length and cut nice material runs a bit big i think itll look nice with a belt great colors,1
568,I ordered this for my honeymoon and its perfect true to size and great with cute shorts,1
569,This sweaterjacket is great over any blouses love the color it looks more slightly peachy cream color that i love goes with everything warm i thought it ran true to size i ordered a small and love the way it fits if you are looking for more of an oversized piece then you would need to size up,1
570,My first pair of pilcros and i am in love i am lbs and bout size in the moss green i have a skinnyathletic build and even though i have a small frame i have thick legs soccer player and big butt and hips but a skinny waist it is hard to find pants that go up my leg over my butt and dont have a huge gap in the back where i have to wear a belt these pants checked all boxes and the best part was the fit around my waist it is like a glove no belt required they have a litt,1
571,This sweater drapes beautifully but beware it is pretty light weight and feels more poly or nylon than wool i dont know if you could wear a top with sleeves underneath either it will probably work best with just a cami that said i love the style note the sweater is pretty long i am and normally p and the regular size came down to my knees the lp was perfect just covers my tush and has adequate room for curves,1
572,I bough this top in blue and i really like the color style and fabric i also bough the necklace as styled in the photo and they look well together its a departure from more tailored clothing for me i keep on trying linen tops and up to now this seems the best cut for linen as the fabric stretches it will still fall nicely,1
573,Im and curvy body shape bought size because i want it to be a bit loose turns out i could go with size too beautiful detail and amazing fabric this come with a crop tank top to go inside the lace blouse,1
574,Detailed beading was beautiful its too boxy way to much fabric in the waistbust and tight on the hips it doesnt fall boxyboyfriend like the grey fabric is not soft and is lighter in color than the picture was hoping this would be my go to sweater for warmth on casual daysbummed,0
575,When this dress first showed up online i liked it but didnt buy it because i wasnt in love retailer weekend popped up so i decided to take advantage of the off and ordered this dress it shipped to me in no time the dress is beautiful the fabric is soft and airy this is the first off the shoulder dress that actually stays off the shoulder no riding up no fussing i suggest sizing down because this dress is slightly flowy,1
576,Super flattering and lovely material dressup or down they run true to size,1
577,Love the fit and feel of these and super stylish too i want in more colors if i can get it,1
578,I am lb and i bought this dress in a petite small which fit perfectly the dress hugs my figure nicely unfortunately i found that the neckline is cut a bit too low to wear to work at least for my own comfort level but i just wear a camisole underneath it for work and without for a date i was really pleased with the purchase of the dress,1
579,Love these socks i need to get more colors they look so good on with boots with the lace showing,1
580,Great too love its flow dolan is a great brand however its definitely large and baggy which is fine just know its not tight im and and ordered a s,1
581,I have been waiting for these to go on sale for some time now and so happy to day they still had my sizein both colors i dont usually buy things the same in different colors but in this case i didfit true to size for me almost had a hard mite buttoning but they are stretchy so dont buy a bigger size they will stretch could not decide which color to keep so kept both i ordered the p p i am and lbs i think these are vanity sized but my usual vanit,1
582,I agree the pictures are confusing the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate this is such a great dress it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicerdressier looking in person than i imagined it would be i think it fits true to size i either wear a or a in most retailer dresses and the in this dress fits me well im planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon i definitely recommend,1
583,I ordered this dress in the green and i love it it does run a little large so i went down one size which was ok by me it is super cute,1
584,This tank is wonderful for those with full hips because it hangs just right to cover any flaws the colors are bright and the material is soft there is a band at the end that elevates the tank so you can wear it out if you would like not too low in the front and overall the tank runs true to size i suppose if you wanted a tighter fit you could size down size but i like the way it hangs in my regular size im very busty and hippy and this top makes both look slim highly recommend,1
585,I was at my local retailer this weekend needing a bathing suit for an upcoming trip and this set was sitting in the get it while it lasts section in my size i tried it on top in two different sizes c and b and a bottom and it was literally the only time in my life ive ever tried on a bathing suit and been happy with the results great material the design is retro but with a modern twist with the fabric supportive top without squishing went with the csame as my regular bras t,1
586,This is a beautiful dress blend of materials give it a great feel the cut and style are very flattering colors allow it to be carried over multiple seasons either on its own or layered for colder weather very happy with this investment,1
587,This top is another winner from left of center i love swing tops and this is just adorable fitted through the sleeves and top portion it drapes nicely in a very flattering way without looking maternity i love the rayon on the upper back which adds interest and a slight contrast i purchased it in the gold color which is beautiful and the fabric is light and very comfortable in my opinion it runs large im usually a sp but ordered an xsp for a more fitted look but it still looked big for,1
588,I absolutely love this bib tee its probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time im pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me i typically wear either a s or m tops,1
589,I saw online great quality sweater dress reviews about seemingly extra fabric easy fix with a seamstress i have very sensitive skin and wear long sleeves under sweaters wool angora mohair xsp tts lengtharms but lots of extra fabric for width just trying it on was too itchy for me,0
590,This shirt is nothing like the online pictures its a stunner in person ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable though i sized up it didnt affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull,1
591,This dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays i cant wait to wear it the bottom portions shines i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine but it really stands out with the darker background the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg,1
592,I was very impressed upon receiving this dress im lbs and ordered xs fit perfect i am also a dd so if you are smaller than a d or big c the top portion might be a little big for you love how it is lined so you could technically wear without a bra i bought the tangerine and have gotten many complements,1
593,This blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times the quality is excellent the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere i highly recommend it,1
594,This is a great dress good quality fabric the pattern color are spot on the silhouette is divine would work on many body types i also love the length,1

600,Love the color of this a rich dark green it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under it is roomy not fitted i ordered a small then thought i should have ordered an xs so then i ordered an xs as well i go between xs and small but because this is not fitted the xs is perfect material is nice soft and super cozy,1
601,Wore this to my sons wedding found it last minute when i had changed my mind about another byron lars dress i felt awesome in it and got many compliments,1
602,I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs i am and i could take them off without unbuttoning them they were hugh even the xs they looked like a halloween costume even at the discounted sale price awful and kind of made me laugh but i guess thats why they are still available at this sale price,0
603,This bra runs very small and is hard to get on and off i think if i went a size up i would be happier,0
604,So im really surprised that reviewers said the fit was too small and too tight in the arms im and lbs and my husband god bless his soul bought me an for my birthday i tried it on just to see and was pretty impressed i could button it across my chest and get it over my arms as those are common problem areas for me regardless i need to exchange the shirt for a larger size because even though i got it on its not how is supposed to look the shirt is loose around the midsection whi,1
605,Im always on the lookout for those special clothing items that add pizzazz to my wardrobe this is one i had been looking for a bomber jacket and tried many but this one falls elegantly and is really beautiful i cant wait to show it off,1
606,This seems like a great top i have only worn it once but it is super soft and comfy yet stylish sleeves are fun color is vibrant as shown,1
607,I was very excited about this product when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected the print is just as lovely in person as it is online i dont even know if sizing up will mak,0
608,I bought this to go with the pants they had online i love them together the sweater seems thin for the price but i still love it,1
609,I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really dont need that i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium the small was tight in the arms so i decided to keep the medium i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing,1
610,I love this dress the beading gives it something special and the petite fits my frame perfectly lightweight enough to wear now and again later with layers for fall very soft fabric,1
611,I love the pattern and shape of this top i can dress it up a bit with white pants and heels or dress it down with shorts and sandals nice fabric and fit,1
612,I bought this shirt in the black cat print the material is very soft and it has a nice drape i wear a size dd and worried that the size zero may be too small across the bust but it fits perfectly i am feet tall with a petite frame the front of the shirt falls a few inches below my waistline and the back of the shirt is longer and provides plenty of coverage so it can be worn with skinny jeans i can also wear this to work with a pair of slacks and it looks nice i would actually love to,1
613,I can wear this to work or dress it up as a cocktail dress the fit is great and the quality is very high am usually a or a depending on the dress and the worked better in this one so if you are between sizes i would size down,1
614,I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it so many people compliment it i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up obviously with a statement necklace too but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink which i hope it doesnt because it is one of my favorite pieces unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the,1
615,I purchased the navy breton stripe version of this shirt its chic versatile and soft a great rendition of a wardrobe classic,1
616,I purchased this jacket and the levis sherpa denim jacket for comparison i chose this one over the levis jacket as this one had more shapecurve to the bodice which i wanted i am usually a small but needed a medium in this jacket i have wider shoulders c chest waist hip lbs,1
617,My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on since then i have purchased the white yellowlemon and rose pink colors for her the material is soft it washes well and it looks great she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts jeans and leggings,1
618,This is a great summer staple tank i first ordered it in black white and im now ordering the coral navy im usually a petite xs i have a short torso but seeing the length on this tank i went with the regular and glad i did also i had previously bought the filigree lace tank same brand and the length of the petite on that tank is the same as this tanks regular length so i knew itd fit perfectly,1

623,I bought this sweater on sale and love it its very sweet comfortable and unique it fits true to size,1
624,Simply perfect i ordered the white floral maillot in a large ish pounds and it is so comfortable and flattering that i do not want to take it off the colors are so vibrant and accurate which is great considering not all internet item photos are the same in person i do recommend ordering a size up the medium was snug but definitely remember that your suit shrinks when wet now that they have a new print hello fish i really really want another,1
625,This dress is beautiful and unique but if you are more pear shaped get the correct size to fit your hips it fits very close through the behind but is stretchy as i was putting it on and felt it hugging me closely i thought it would never work but when i looked in the mirror i found it looked quite nice even though it clings and the stretch allows plenty of movement if i size up to allow more room in the hips then i think it will be too loose on top so i will just wear it with spanx th,1
626,The first day i wore this dress to work i was amazed by how many people commented on it i knew i liked it but apparently so does everyone else,1
627,The cut of the bodice is very strange and unflattering it is great quality but designed poorly returned it,0

635,I bought this tunic is blue it is now one of my favorite tops to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings i have always love rayon this top did not disappoint me it feels very soft and silky which makes it perfect for warmer days for reference i am lbs the xs p fits me just like the modellose and not too long i love it so much that i am considering another in different color,1
636,This printcolor combination is really pretty i think its a little muted compared to the picture but still very pretty it is definitely longer than expected im and it almost touches the floor will definitely need to wear with heels colors will actually work in the fall with boots and in spring with heeled sandals it actually has a shorter underskirt so theres no accidental show i really like the dark blue wrap extra fabric at top sits below the waist and will help hide imp,1
637,I think reviews says it all basic tee with a little tailoring on upper back in a variety of colors i purchased the purple floral tee in my local store and it is prettier in person than on the website much more vibrant in color it is tts,1

642,This sweatercoat is great it super comfortable its perfect for my california winters it could be layered for colder areas this piece definitely runs large like really large i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium it is meant to be boxy and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering id definitely say go in store and try it on youll love it,1
643,If these jeans work for you youre a lucky girl the fabric is really thick and soft pocket detail is cool and the hidden multicolored button placket is a nice detail i ordered down a size theyre tight across my thighs and seem shorter than a inseam the fit is boxy and not flattering on me but pants are so cute i may keep them anyway,0
644,Unique and stylish dress looks much better on than in the pictures,1
645,I love the colors however is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric no lining what so ever the fabric is very thin you will need a slip looks just like a coverup going back,0
646,This is by far the cutest most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places it doesnt show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events absolutely love this suit in navy wasnt in love with the rest of the patterns hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon,1
647,I have owned a lot of stevies in the past the only problem with them for me has been the rise i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise voila these have the perfect mid rise for me they are really soft too long for my inch inseam they bunch at the ankles but dont drag i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle but i also think theyre fine how they are i bought my normal size they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them t,1
648,Perfect for when youre a guest at someones home having guests or just lounging prettiest set youll ever own youll feel as if your on vacation even if youre not i wouldnt travel without this set highly recommend love,1
649,I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years they fit great tts stay put and wear very well these are well worth the price,1
650,Form fitting hugs in the right spots and love the pattern its a little shorter than i expected and too formal to wear to work however an excellent evening dress,1
651,You cant tell by the photo but the top is actually a slightly shiny materialso it gives it a classy going out look in the picture it looks more casual but i can see myself wearing this on a night out with a skirt wearing it to work or whatever i tried it on and i thought wow i look thin its a little shorter than i normally wear dont worry its not a crop top but notice where the bottom hem sits on the models hips probably midrise but it looked amazing on zippers in the ba,1
652,This top is my new favorite i ordered it on a whim and oh boy am i glad i was so excited for it to be shipped to me and once it arrived i couldnt wait to put it once i put it on i couldnt wait to show it off it is such a great bluishgrayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings shorts and sandals such an easy classic simple shirt that i will probably wear too much,1
653,This dress has a beautiful shape it was a onesie in a store only one they had and im glad i tried it on usually im a or this is an and its a perfect fit definitely size up at least one dress size the knit shoulders are beautiful and the belt is slimming i love the writing on it its a classic dress and it makes me feel beautiful and unique,1
654,Oh my i just received my dress and it is gorgeous i was a little skeptical with the reviews but i am on the slender side so perhaps that is the body type it works for i am b with a waist i got a size and it fits well i am and the length is good too not too long i could wear reasonable heelwedges it is a great class sophisticated look the material is great quality i cant wait for an occasion to wear it to,1
655,I came across this in the store and immediately fell in love with it the online photos just dont do it justice i bought the white version because the little pops of red in the details and the dobby weave are so sweet and unique a size fit perfectly the fabric is a bit sheer so be prepared to wear a cami underneath very light airy and comfortable,1
656,These are the second pair of paige jeans i have purchased and i have not been disappointed jeans are great for casual dress or a night out on the town fit stays true even after first wash wish i had a pair of these in every color,1
657,Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see i received many compliments my only gripe is that i dont love when shirts have those connecting camisoles which make it harder to put on as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining but it didnt deter me i am lbs c muscularcurvy frame and a size fit perfectly,1
658,Dress just arrived and i was a bit nervous of the fit based on the other six reviewers stating it runs small i actually found it to run exactly true to size im slender and on average i wear a size which is what i ordered regular and it fits as though it was custom made for me this dress is made very well looks tailored and hits me right above the knee similar to the model i feel i scored big by purchasing it at the sale price,1
659,Best bathing suit bottoms ever lowrise doesnt work forever and this bottom is perfect if you want a little more coverage without being too momish the ruching gives it a really cute retro feel as opposed to a granny panties feel my usual size small fits great and i definitely did not have the problem another reviewer did with it coming up past the belly button it hits me right where it hits the model in the photo i just wish they made it in more prints there are some really cute top,1
660,Love the asymmetrical zipper style fabric and color so soft comfy and warm i got a size small and it fits perfectly and isnt tight or loose the pockets are sewn shut but easily opened by cutting the thread with scissors highly recommend this cute and functional jacket,1
661,Dress just did not fit will around the hips also the string belt was defective basically about to come off looks like someone may have wore it and returned it was not flattering at all,0
662,Bought the green t shirt very pretty subtle floral detail near the shoulders love scalloped neck design this t is more sheer than the average t so ill be layering it over a tank fit is true to size,1
663,Love this jacket the sleeves are a little bigloose but its not quite as flattering as it could be but its so comfy its worth it great quality,1
664,This jacket is cute and comfy,1
665,This jacket is extremely good quality has gorgeous detailing and is warm quilting makes it thicker than expected but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket highly recommend,1
666,I am so love in this top i wish i had it in all colors and will absolutely be watching the sale rack for these ones i love this top i work out at a gym that requires tops but that means i cannot usually display my awesome sports bras with cute strappy backs this yoga top has an open back which will show these off which i really like the draped back keeps you nice and cool also and the fit is amazing i have some extra baby belly that i cant seem to work offit was invisible in this top,1
667,Unfortunately the dress is pulling apart after the first wash gentle hand wash cycle also there are no brastraps holders and my bra straps did show up a lot,0
668,I absolutely love this top im always either an xsmall or in mauve i think this top runs small i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest im average in bust,1
669,Wear the collar down it favors grace kelly pull it up and its an oversized hood this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater a coat in one,1
670,I was looking for a really warm but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area i tried on a size small which is my usual coat size while the coat fit it was not flattering for reference i am pounds and usually wear a smallxsmall in retailer tops in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on the front material is doubled which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach the shoulders are bulky and,0
671,My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on they are so comfortable and really cute i am usually a size and the size small fit great with some room,1
672,So the other review complained that there are slits on the sleeves of this blouse yes that is true however i love that about this blouse i tried this blouse on in the store so the slits were not a surprise to me but i can understand how they may upset a customer who wasnt expecting them i think the slits are elegant and are in no way obtrusive or revealing you could totally still wear this blouse to work or a nice dinner i love it because its unique enough to be worn alone and simple i,1
673,It is so beautiful and just as shown in the pictures very elegant i normally wear a small and it hung off me just a little,1
674,This is a sweet top as it is shown on the model it appears there is a panel behind the lace on the front of the top this is not sothe entire front of the top is see through one would need to wear a camisole the material on the blouse is very sheerit appears to be rather cheap actually if you are wearing a top this sheer it does not make sense to have a camisole on underneath that said you are going to be able to see your bra and skin down to your belly button if you do not have a camisol,0
675,I wish this dress was more fitted the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture i bought this dress in an xs but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress sad to say that it is going back,0
676,Im glad i tried this on i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print but i wasnt so sure about the cut or style of the top once it was on however i loved it i dont much care for the aline tops that remind me of maternity wear theyre cute on railthin young girls but not so much on mombod women in their s this top is the exception the details from the buttons to the thin pleats the unique cut of the bustline and the print make this top both lovely and flattering i wore,1
677,Love these charlies the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too i ordered one size up mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter like usual and the description said slim fit i went from a to an and the s werent big at all so they might run a tad on the small side side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband but i dont think that can be prevented,1
678,The softest cotton gauze but not see through relaxed but the sleeves neckline make it flattering a gorgeous blue in person so in love with this dress going back for it in white,1
679,These are really nice jeans i am a jean fanatic some patches are faded others are dark with still others with stitching across them very distinctive and nice they are truly a boyfriend fitso if you them big they are ag makes very nice jeans both in fit and quality i buy other brands but not often,1
680,Im small pounds and a so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath or i can wear the tunic by itself and leggings plus a pair of boots the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting is size down to xxs i got the yellow flower and white grey one and plan to get the navy one soon the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it i put,1
681,As much as i wanted to love this top it was too flowy and and i felt like i looked bigger than i am im a size maybe a smaller size would have made a big difference,0
682,Im tall and pounds and ordered this in an xxsp its a little loose but still looks really attractive on my body its warmer and thicker than i thought it would be and lined i love it taller petites might want to size into regular because even on my superpetite body it hit a few inches above the knees perfect length for me but will hit higher for those tallerits going to become a staple,1
683,I really love this dress its very flattering for all body types im and i purchased a small it also looks really cute with a stretchy belt in the picture it doesnt show this but it has these cute snap sleeves that adds some great detail its also very comfortable it is a thin material so for those looking for a thicker fabric this may not be the right dress loved it,1
684,I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length i got a small and i am the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me i love the soft material and could live in this dress such a great staple for my closet,1
685,I dont normally like how i look in rompers but this one was so cute i had to try i was pleasantly surprised that it fit great and was comfortable too,1
686,I bought a size a few years back not my regular size but when used it tend to sag so this time i bought a size my regular size,1
687,Cute colored jeans ordered the sky color when it arrived the color was a medium moss green color the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them,1
688,These are nice comfortable summer pants that travel well the material has a nice feel to itlightweight but not too thin they are easy to wear with any summer top and look just dressy enough i like the elastic waist but the pants will stretch out a bit and run a little large,1
689,I saw these sweaters in the store this fall and took a pass they didnt look cute and i thought they wouldnt be cute on because the little pockets looked droopy but i was so wrong once they went on sale i took a chance bc i needed a black lightweight cardigan for a trip ordered a size small and it fits perfect so cute i just love it glad i bought it at the sale price because now im even happier,1
690,I actually love the fit of this t the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit but i love that it has more of a flared shape the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape,1
691,Lovely statement shift sweet and sophisticated at the same time the lightweight knit drapes nicely over ones figure my store showed it paired with a collared creamwhite blouse for alternative styling i know ill be experimenting with solid tees,1
692,I agree with the other two reviews that this shirt runs large or something i ordered an xs my usual size xss the body of the shirt is very loose the upper arms are a bit snug and i dont have large arms the shoulder seams are in a very strange place but when you look at the model it doesnt look so bad with the shirt i received and another reviewer the seam was puffy making for a strange look in theory the shirt should have worked but didnt i loved the pattern not the fit,0
693,The top is gorge it may look somewhat slouchy but it falls perfect and looks great especially the navy color with white jeans i liked it so much i ordered the ivory color too beware the quality of this top is extremely delicate and if you dont want it to snag do not wear a bracelet that can snag it,1
694,Love it goes well with a lot super soft,1
695,The design on the blue sweater is actually a dark navy not black as i thought it was but it still looks beautiful with black underneath rather than jeans like its shown the vneck is a nice change from other cardigans i have looks great with a cami or another vneck underneath it soft nice mediumweight and not at all itchy happy with this as an easy everyday sweater,1
696,I love finding unique retailer pieces that dont require dry cleaning i was excited to find this shirt but its not flattering the bottom hem is a little tight which makes the rest of the shirt look bulky perhaps it would work better on people who have narrow hips i also didnt like the pink tones when i saw the colors in person ill be returning this item,0
697,Love this dress so much its super comfortable and i always get a ton of compliments every time i wear it the fabric is the perfect weight not too heavy ill be wearing this all summer long,1
698,Cute swing tee fit for me is perfect i am and lbs and i bought my usual small length is nice fits me just at my hips i can wear to work and on the weekends a little concerned the fabric may pill so im taking extra care receive compliments every time i wear either color love,1
699,Fits well comfortable and flattering i wouldnt call this pattern fabric purple though it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color the picture is an accurate representation of the color,1
700,I paid full price for these gladly the olive ones and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale they are midweight soft flattering and stylish they stretch a little belt needed but not much pilcro are my goto pants and these hit it out of the park i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather,1
701,I bought this in the green plaid for travel since i dont wear long pants of this fabric weight here in honolulu it is styled so that you can roll the bottoms up for a more casual look showing some ankle and wearing dress flats would be a perfect casual work look with a navy tee since im only and this is travelwear i got it in a regular rather than petite because i wanted to keep the cuffedlook but cover my ankles i tend toward adventure travel and these held up well on a recent t,1
702,Like the other reviewers said it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured i tried it on and tied the string around the back so its an open vest i love if,1
703,Love the aqua print which looks vaguely japanese to me the quality is good but unlike the other reviewer i had to size up my usual size x small was too tight wish there were more colors,1
704,This is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small i usually take a small but i took a medium in this for reference i am lbs chest c i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate got the off today and couldnt be happier with this purchase,1
705,This tee is so cute and well constructed its not a fabric thats going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love it runs tts and i like that its thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole just a nude bra,1
706,I bought this dress in green and i really like it the bodice is a substantial knit light enough for summer but thicker and sturdier than the typical jersey tee and the skirt is a lightweight woven fabric with good drape true to size and extremely comfortable its a great work dress the striped colorblocking is not very flattering on my frame broad shoulders larger chest but its not bad youll probably want to try it on in person,1
707,Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on lightasair silk im so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours thats how pretty it is the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since its an aline skirt that doesnt cling yes the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely im a top heavy dd large rib cage with a square waist and no hips and,1
708,This dress either runs large or just has too much fabric ordered my usual size but it is too long and too baggy to do a thing for me embroidery pretty but background is more of a muddy gray then denim as shown if the smaller size in petite was available id have exchanged it but it is going back,0
709,I reallllly love this sweater i could wear it every day if i could the sweater is comfortable lightweight but not see through and versatile,1
710,Wanted to love this sweater for its beautiful colors and cute graphic but the fit is uncomfortably small and it is so itchy i was yelling get it off in the fitting room bummer,0
711,I have many moulinette soeurs creations all are true to my size breathtakingly beautiful unique made well i ordered this dress and i am very excited about receiving it soon the front neckline is round and it becomes a v in the back,1
712,I have received several compliments when wearing this sweater perfect to dress up or dress down purchased it in black and red does run on large i am roughly lbs ordered an xs,1
713,This is such a pretty top i love the mix of patterns the colors are beautiful it really looks great on the peplum is very minimal in this top the entire top itself is somewhat oversized but in a pretty way i bought this in a large and probably could have gone with a medium but didnt want the length to be any shorter so im sticking with the large for reference im ft and lbs i usually wear a size or mediumlarge also i didnt notice a puckering between the two m,1
714,I love this dress so much absolutely beautiful true to the size since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment the flowers is very spring and summary very sexy to the bottom,1
715,Such a great shirt loved the fit and how it feels i paired it with grey jeansloved it so much i ordered it in another color for myself and ordered one for a friend,1
716,This is a beautiful sweater high quality cashmere was used as it is very soft as other reviewers stated the sweater does run large so i purchased one size down and ordered an xxs for a perfect fit i went with yellow which is a great color this is not high low which i love i am so thrilled that just as soon as im finished writing this review im going to purchase another sweater in red,1
717,This top looks so much better on than it does in the pictures very flattering cut and the fabric is amazingly comfortable runs true to size i got my normal xs,1
718,Love this and wish it came in more colors the fabric and cut are so comfortable i bought my usual size and was a little sad to see that it shrunk just a touch in the wash washed and then air dried but put in dryer for mins to speed up drying process im so its already short but now ill probably just have to wear it as a cover up or loungewear around the house super cute though and great price with sale on sale,1
719,These jeans are very comfortable i really like the high waist just what i was looking for,1
720,This is a beautiful and fashionable blouse it feels good on as it is made of viscose it is pretty and feminine color is great of course it needs to be your color i love it and recommend it,1
721,This skirt fits amazing i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe,1
722,I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store tried it on but didnt have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed noticed it on sale online and had to order it is so comfortable and flattering the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape not slinky at all,1
723,Very nice polkadot pattern i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans it is a timeless classic,1
724,Loved the green color the cut is super flattering but alas i do need hte petite ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost unfrotuantely the color is sold out in petite,1
725,I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue i couldnt believe what a great deal i got while on sale,1
726,So super soft and comfortable great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress,1
727,I just got this in the mail the other day i was really excited and then crushed one buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling it looked old and i wore it about hours i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back too bad but not what i bought and then not,0
728,I loved this skirt the material is so fun and a love the pattern unfortunately they didnt have the size i needed so it had to go back to the store,1
729,I have had a lot of complements while wearing this dress i purchased it in the grey other reviews felt that this dress ran large i agree that it might be a little larger than other retailer purchases i have made but not by much i purchased it in small usually what i wear in dresses im very tall at mostly legs and the length is great also the neck line is perfect on me and i have a fairly average torso length i am very happy with the purchase,1
730,I love this dress good for work or social occasions flowy fabric and not boxy the length is perfect not too short i cant wait to wear it picture is accurate as to color,1
731,Ive never owned a romper before but after trying it on at the store i fell in love im pearshaped at i got a med and it fits beautifully with just enough room to not be baggy i got the red mitif super flattering,1
732,I can always count on retailer to sell unique pieces so when i saw this sweatshirt online i ordered it right away its adorable and quirky however when i received it in the mail it reminded me of something my grandma would wear the sleeves are puff sleeves and are really long while the bottom of the sweatshirt hit pretty high on my waist that when i raised my arms my stomach was showing if this was a more tailored sweatshirt i would be keeping it but sadly its going back,0
733,This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy its flattering and looks great with jeans,1
734,Ordered online in white just received it love i i wear m in most clothing size dress jacket fits perfectly would love one in the peach color shown in the pic but from the reviews stating it is much deeper in colour decided against it,1
735,What a cute swing sweater and so easy to layer this jacket looks great snapped or left open and the collar and hood leave such a soft look around your neck this has such great elements of cozy and warmth just in time for cool weather,1
736,I really like the skirt its very comfortable and i can wear it with so many colors,1
737,Was looking for the perfect birthday dressand i found it gorgeous i generally wear a size or but opted for a size to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove,1
738,I ordered both colors in size xl and theyre each now favorite purchases the fit is true to sizeit matches the photos the orangewhitebrownred combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklacethe tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement both are so unique charming ive been pairing them with different retailer cardigans necklaces theyve washed well tooin a mesh bag on gentle,1
739,Such a pleasant surprise i saw this in the store and had to try it on it looks and feels like a lightweight real suede the color is a wonderful neutralmuch prettier than what i am seeing in the pic here fits tts although i will wear petites in dresses and some pants i found the regular xs to be just right,1
740,This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable i am always an xl in retailer tops but i needed to go down to a large on this one this blouse is cut generously everywhere but going down one size was perfect for me the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area so it has a very nice drape in the back the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow i wore a nude bra underneath and i cant see m,1
741,Love this top got xs fits perfectly wish it came in more designs,1
742,These pants look nice and they are comfortable too the relaxed fit isnt sloppy and the colors are great,1
743,I found this in store last weekend and thought it was it perfect i got the size small which had plenty of space for me usually a or small aits long i found it to be just below knee length if you zoom in you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in backit has pockets too btw this will be worn over everything this summer lets hope the polyrayonspandex blend washes ok,1
744,This top is my new favorite i thought it might have too much volume but it does not it is very flattering the color looks just like the picture,1
745,This is such a cool military jacket when i saw it displayed on a table at my local retailer i knew it was going home with me this is my th marrakech jacket i love their style i bought the black in my usual size large and i agree with the previous reviewer if you have a chest this is a very flattering jacket i usually wear my jackets open and i discovered that if you button back the lapels at the second button down it looks amazing and not so sloppy it kind of bothered me the way,1
746,When i saw this online i thought it was going to be a thin summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it it is not thin and wispy but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings the zipper pockets look cool too would definitely recommend,1
747,I didnt have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big when i got the dress i was beyond disappointed it is a heavy itchy polyesterlike fabric not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows it is also a deep black not the plum color in photos but most importantly i am and the dress is very short on me it,0
748,Love the color and overall design of this dressbut its just going to have to go back the view from the direct front and back are nice but froth side the high waist and secure back make me look pregnant not the look im going for especially at this pricethe other oddity is that the white circle design is unfortunately placed in the back its all i see which is right on a bullseye and the same on the front i dont know how the designer missed this its the only white design on th,0
749,It goes without saying that trenches are timeless but this one broke the mold with its femininity in the flare and the finally different color i saw this and put it in my cart debated and went back a few days later as i always end up doing because i could not live without it and it was no longer available i was devastated and could have kicked myself but i waited a bit longer went back on the website and thank god retailer had ordered more from the designer and had replenished stock,1
750,I am and pounds with an athletic cury body type the dress wore bulky and ran large at size,0
751,I bought this in store yesterday in a petite it definitely looks best if you can get it in your usual size petite just looked too big and changes the look love the embroidery detail it was on display with the sleeves rolled up to elbows and its really cute that way too,1
752,Im always an xl in retailer blouses and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep however in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would meaning i had to go down sizes even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy the body is cut like a trapeze aline so very forgiving the fabric has a lot of stretch to it so the arms arent tight the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice just a heads up for anyone who would c,1
753,I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress with very interestingly cut seams the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract gorgeous and high qualityfit i am and curvy usually a size and the xl fits quite roomy on me thats the size i ordered because i like flowy things so it definitely runs large usually i have better luck with aline dress shap,1
754,I am six feet tall and this sweater is a perfect fit for tunic length over skinny jeans if you are shorter i assume it would be longer i bought the green color which is a beautiful dark hunter green the bodice is fitted and doesnt show any bra straps and the bottom is slightly loose and forgiving love this sweater,1
755,The dress is as great in person as it shows in the pictures if you usually buy petite keep in mind that you may like the regular size if you prefer the llonger look if you prefer a shorter length go for the petite size if this is what you usually get i am lbs and tried both xs regular and xs petite i ultimately went with the regular size as i preferred the longer lengtheverything about this dress is perfect the color the material the cut highly recommended as a transition,1
756,The print and fabric are great but this dress has odd construction or maybe i have an odd construction anyway im weigh d i ordered the small and it fit perfect up top and in the arms but the issue was in the hips im somewhere between athletic and curvy the skirt looks more aline in the photo but its actually cut pretty straight spanx would have helped but im not about to wear spanx all day in a workcasual dress i think a medium would make the top too big so i,0
757,I have been watching this dress online since it arrived finally decided to order it online it is as great in person as it looks on the website the fabric cut and finishing of the dress are high quality and my usual size fits great it falls about above the knee on my frame which is a little short for the office but i could do it on a friday with a cardigan the fit is comfortable and flattering for a gal with broad shoulders and small curves when i tried it on friends raved thi,1
758,I ordered in this in the kelly green and loved it so much i wore it the very next day after it came in the mail the green color is gorgeous and easily complements so many other colors in my wardrobe the cardigan itself is super comfy and i love the full length longsleeves so many cardigans these days come with length sleeves which are fine but sometimes you want a long sleeve the fit almost runs on the larger side but i think that a slightly looser look works well for this cardigan,1
759,How can you go wrong with soft cotton top that is neither too snug nor too loose expect will wear these as layers under when really cold and by them selves in early spring and in the fall great colors and love the multiple textures,1
760,I love this great quality and flattering id definitely agree that it runs true to size as i had to size up because it was the only size available and it is a little large in the stomach and rear but it works well in the chest area the v neck isnt too low and the sides provide good coverage up top also it covers the rear end well material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality super happy with this purchase just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more,1
761,Perfect fit and ive gotten so many compliments i buy all my suits from here now,1
762,I love the material on these shorts unfortunately thats all i love the fit is awkward and im an easy fit theyre boxy in the body legs and a bit tight in the waist causing me to not be sure whether to place the elastic waist higher or lower and neither one works well sadly couldnt keep these just for the pretty fabric,0
763,The jacket is great the quality is very good and the fit too the best part is how it looks,1
764,I was looking for a dress that would make me feel as special as i would feel when i attend my daughters baby shower this design featuring a variety of spring influenced flower motifs embossed upon an eyelet fabric was exactly what my minds eye envisioned the use of the solid colored shirtdress button line and cuffs softly pulled all the elements of this unique work beautifully together i found the fit to be almost costumed made for my figure the number of compliments i received on the da,1
765,I treated myself to get this at fullprice at the start of summer my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos i have gotten such good use out of this blouse it washes well without shrinking its vintagelooking so comfortable i love the arm coverage interesting neckline that covers bra straps good length the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away i use another tank underneath id love any of the colors the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of,1
766,I was so excited to splurge on a mara hoffman suit and was sorely disappointed when i received this suit in the mail im petite and fairly curvy so i knew it would likely be a little long in the torso but the whole suit was so oddly shaped i couldnt imagine anyone it would fit the square shape in between the halter pieces is awkward and the pieces that are supposed to hold your chest are super wide and loose,0
767,Had to return this for a couple of reasons was too small its made like one of those tiny mittens that stretches to fit any size hand i didnt bother to order a size up because i wasnt sure whether to go from a small to a medium or to a large the main color isnt grey like the picture its a black and white checkered pattern so it doesnt look at all grey irlim still recommending because if you get the right size and like the colors it will be a nice light and comfy swea,0
768,This is a beautiful top it is something great to have in your wardrobe for the holiday season or a nice date night option i highly recommend it it runs true to size the price is actually reasonable as far as dressy retailer tops go as well,1
769,This shirt is absolutely beautiful the front is very thin and delicate but wearing a nude bra underneath you cant see a thing i did need to add a snap between the top two buttons to avoid the chest gap but the back of the shirt offers enough stretch that it doesnt appear to pull at all its hard to find a button down that fits nicely when your short waisted and large chested this one is it,1
770,Love this suit i ordered up a size on the bottoms and am so glad i did the style fits true to size is beautiful and vibrant i thought it looked like ribbing vertically but it is just part of the design it is not padded at all but is thick enough to be seamless,1
771,Like other reviewers have mentioned i was hesitant to spend so much money on a swimsuit after lots of searching and reading reviews to try to find a bathing suit for a newly postpartum body i went for it i am so happy that i did it fits perfectly snug in all the right places and makes my extra baby pudge seem nonexistent before baby i was a bikinionly kind of girl so i wasnt sure how id feel in a one piece in this style it really is better than i could have imagined i highly recom,1
772,I love this shirt it is so soft and a bit see through so recommend wearing a camisole underneath perfect with jeans the fit is slightly boxy but works well,1
773,This top is amazing i originally ordered it in small which fit but opted for a large for the option of wearing it more off or the shoulder the large fit perfect great length for leggings and can wear both off the shoulder or just one cant wait for fall for reference im lbs b,1
774,This is my favorite kind of dress comfortable unique and can dress up or down i am and lb and bought the regular because there were no petites available it fit perfectly the material is buttery soft and looks like it will hold up well and i love the orangered color the tie detail makes this dress stand out and i find the cut very flattering so glad i ordered it,1
775,Love this top it is fitted through the shoulders and arms and has a slight swing the peplum falls at a great spot and the material lays nicely very flattering on my months postpartum body that is on the rebound i got the blue but i might get the pink too,1
776,This blouse is a beauty i love the hemline across the bust and all the flowy fabric that drapes in front and in back i love the long length and the side slits the wide hemline at the bottom is lovely the cotton is soft and light and as amazing to wear as it is to look at it makes me feel beautiful just having it on be aware the fabric is sheer and requires a tank but i dont mind as it is both pretty and comfortable i sized up which fits how i like i never tried it on in my normal size,1
777,These wanderer pants are my go to i love the patch pocket styling they are true to size but seem to stretch so buy a size down trust me it will work,1
778,This is the best little romper i have ever tried on i dont typically love myself in shorts but these are so flowing and the pattern is so pretty i couldnt resist the material is nice and the length is great im and lbs and the small fit great,1
779,I tried these on instore not intending to buy them was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans and loved them great medium blue color and they fit me so nicely i am with actual hips and thighs the price is a bit high for me though hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale,1
780,I ordered the cream the fabric is unique similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality you definitely need a cami or tank underneath its form fitting without being too snug i like to wear it with distressed jeans front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle my trouble spot with chunky accessories belt necklace and a block heel its a little pricey but decided worth it,1
781,This dress makes me so sadthe textured stretchy fabric color length and overall swingy fit are spot on as another reviewer noted though the armholes and neck totally ruin the dress the neck is tiny which i could have gotten over once it was on but the arm holes were just awful too big all around too tall of a cut plus too wide of a cut basically you could see my bra plus from the front there was unflattering exposure near the armholes it could have been so good but alas but t,0
782,Im so happy i decided to order this dress i am lbs and normally buy xs petite but the comments said the dress is a little short so i went with a xs regular in navy i am glad i did it hits me about inches above the knee the material is very soft and seems well constructed a bit thicker than your average summer dress but i like that very flattering overall and for the price its a great steal,1
783,I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model i am really surprised at how beautiful wellfitting and soft this dress is i am in love it fits snugly but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate i work at a law firm i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees,1
784,I had bee struggling to find a romper with longer length shorts it seems like so many of the rompers have short shorts for the bottom half and i wanted something to hit upper mid leg something like a inseam on a short on a whim i ordered this and hoped it would be long enough and sure enough it is perfect still stylish and still short for summer without it being so short on the bottom well made nice closure at bust so there is no gaping,1
785,I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silverwouldnt recommend it,0
786,This is a soft light sweater that will take you through fall i got the raspberry which seems more like a cinnamon color to me the design is really cute with the fabric inset in the back i got three of these in different colors so obviously i really like them for layering and can recommend them it seems tts i am and lbs medium is perfect,1
787,I really love the colors of this dress very unique and classy combo little bit of a retro look to it even though there is no zipper its somehow fitted and flattering i plan to wear it to a wedding this summer in the mountains where it gets chilly in the evening so im thrilled to find a summer dress with sleeves it will work well for plenty of other occasions too only problem is the buttons on the sleeves are nearly impossible to button just too tight for reference im lbs an,1
788,Really like these they fit really well and look great with a pair of chucks and a sweater if im dressing down a bit as well as with flats and a nicer blouse really versatile im kind of pearshaped and these seem to minimize my flaws a bit too so that never hurts,1
789,I love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice,1
790,Great jumpsuit even better in person elegant and stylish iam and lb m fits perfectly material is not see throug that was my biggest concern sooo happy that i got it,1
791,Love this shirt i have a bit of a tummy so i usually dont buy shorter shirts but with my high waisted denim and skirts it looks great,1
792,I was so excited when i purchased this top it was going to be my go to for running around as it looked super cute with leggings and boots the softness alone made me feel like i was wearing my pajamasso comfy that all changed after one washingit is now pilling and not nearly as soft as before makes me sad but it is going back,0
793,This shirt is like the best worn in flannel with a little feminine flair super soft and great length,1
794,Id give this dress stars if i could its possibly the best dress ive bought at retailer in years of shopping there the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage for anyone with a bit of a tummy the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch the fit is true to size the pattern is bohemian and elegant not hippy dippy at all im,1
795,I love this dress the fabric is creativechecked lace the silhouette is figure flattering work appropriate and can wear it for dinner with a change of shoes and jewelry,1
796,Usually red tops which are a true red are hard to find this is more red in person that in the photo great feel to material and the drape is wonderful sometimes peplum tops can make me look bigger than i am and lbs but this one has a nice slimming effect and the vneck is complimentary to a smaller bust b love it,1
797,Fits just like on the model even though im really happy with this casual summer find,1
798,This sweater is perfect for cool days the fit is true to size though a bit longer than in the photos especially the sleeves im petite i actually liked the length so did not order petite the sweater is a relatively soft cotton blend it is comfortable and the ruffle adds just the right amount of finesse the ruffle is stitched on all the way so it doesnt open in front which is a plus the blue grey is marled and more grey than blue the red is beautiful and as pictured,1
799,I love the colors and pattern on this dress and its nice that it has a lining so no slip needed the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however im pretty small up top and the neckline comes pretty low so i either have to wear my craziest pushup bra or get the top altered i havent decided what my plan is yet but will keep the dress for sure,1
800,I have the raspberry jumper and i feel like royalty in it the silk is luxurious and looks expensive when i walk if feels like it is fluttering around me like butterflies around sleeping beauty typically i am quite disappointed when trying a jumper and find that what looked amazing on the model simply makes me look goofy but this one is the exception i think the super long length although problematic as well as the soft elegant drape of he fabric as well as the angled cut at the bodice ar,1
801,This tee is so comfortable and stylish you can easily dress it up i love how the back covers your assets and the sleeves are long enough for tall girls a great buy on sale i bought a small and bought colors,1
802,I know its a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out but on the off chance any come back in stock or if you see one at your local store i urge you to try it on the fabric is incredible so luxurious it fits me amazingly i have a hard time with the whole tight chemiseslipnightie category of clothing as im fairly skinny but still curvy and while i love my curves i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when youre trying to look sexy this however is a godsend,1
803,I recently purchased this dress in the yellow which is not advertised online but glad i saw at the store because the color is vibrant but not too loud and really compliments my olive skin the dress ran a little on the larger side so i had to size down also you will have to either wear a strapless bra or go without because you cant hide bra straps as this is more of a halter look im and the length was perfect for me will be able to wear with heels or flats,1
804,I went a size down on this top it was to billowy in my regular size it has the elastic waist but it was bunching up too much in that area i love the embroidery it is gorgeous will have to hand wash for sure,1
805,This is more beautiful in person i love the detail and color i usually dont like ponchos but this ones shape with the square front definitely sets this apart,1
806,Ive been on the hunt for flattering cords for a long time and these fit the bill bought the silver on friday and am going to order the pink the silver is really more taupe as pictured so if youre looking for true grey this is not the pair for you but the fit is fantastic im athletic build about lbs and the fits perfectly finally cords that dont make my muscular thighs look giant,1
807,I love this sweater hoping to order the other color the weight of the sweater is perfect not too heavy i also really liked how the sweater lays with leggings because it is not bulky great sleeve length,1
808,Excellent dress for lounging in the house or for sleeping very comfortable and a little sexy at the same time,1
809,I saw this top online and loved it i wasnt sure about sizing and because i dont live near a store i decided to order two sizes im and typically wear an or medium in tops the in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders i sized up to a and it fit beautifully,1
810,Ive been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms back this one fits nicelyjust a pretty feminine happy summer top that still lets me be leggy i cant see them in the photos but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots very fun im and when i paired this with jean shorts everything below the crotch was visibleso perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics,1
811,Im with a b bra size and a size fit perfectly and could not have been more comfortable one big plus for me is that it is virtually wrinkle free i purchased the orange which is a lovely muted orange not neon or too bright and received multiple compliments when i wore it to work the first time,1
812,I have no idea why this has bad reviews how is there any left this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green i love that it comes with a cami its very flattering and not too wide or boxy the lace detail is amazing i bought my usual size and it fits perfect love this top,1
813,Although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist it is perfect many compliments the hem is so funalso other reviews mentioned the bow,1
814,Love this top love that it ia jersey knit which makes it comfortable love the print which makes it stand out love the design of a side bow i did not have an issue with the banded hem in fact i like how it makes the top more structured,1
815,Received this jacket yesterdayand it is lovelyvery well made with a relaxed yet feminine fitthe cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online was slightly disappointed with that but being more subtle will make it more wearableso no oh she is wearing that jacket againthe forest green is rich and elegantthe fit is true to size but this is not a fitted jacket it falls more straight but the peplum is a gorgeous accent a classic with impeccable quality,1
816,Im glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly i love the taupe color its feminine not overtly so and i can still use it as a neutral the quality is really quite good though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories without smooth edges away from the fabric its also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia,1
817,This shirt is perfect hangs nicely and i love the little longer sleevesbeautiful color too,1
818,I was wavering on this post purchase but then decided to wear it to a store opening event and double digit people asked me where i got it or commented that they liked it i guess i made the right decision the inside is a super soft gray jersey knit wears great with black,1
819,I love this top it is flattering in all the right places i struggle with shirts the are too flowy however this is forgiving yet looks more fitted and flattering i bought the shirt in blue and am buying it now in red i typically buy a large or xl in this shirt a large is perfect,1
820,I love this jumpsuit im usually a size small however i was a lot more comfortable in an xs the fit was comfortable and sexy i received a lot of compliments and a couple of i need to borrow that from you im only tall so it went down all the way to my ankles but i paired it with open toed heels and it worked the neck line is pretty high but you can adjust it to your comfort i highly recommend this jumpsuit even to the petite ladies,1
821,The price is amazing for this easy and flattering dress looks great as is or with a scarf sweater jacket you name it i just couldnt resist getting carried away with this one,1
822,Walked into the retailer store in new york while on vacation and saw this on display had to try it on immediately and loved the look received several compliments from customers in the store its beautifully made soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come you will need to size down cause it runs large i love it,1
823,I found this dress to be very short waisted much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses ive gotten from retailer it really could have used those inches above the waist just a strange fit overall,0
824,This cardigan is so fun to wear you can wear it like as it is shown on this model or turn bottom up and wear upside down as tag suggestion,1
825,I just recently purchased this skirt and i love itits cotton with spandex incorporated so its soft and not stiff it hugs your waist and accentuates your butt nicely the lace up is unique in design so it can be dressed up with a sparkle blouse or dressed casual in a tshirt im in height so the length is very flattering and it zips up in the back great color cream and excellent quality,1
826,This is a beautiful long midi blazer that happens to feel like a sweatshirt buy it youll look super classy and put together i wear to work and going out ive been noted to also curl up in bed wearing this because its so comfortable and i forgot to switch into a sweatshirt note im on the short side so the blazer ends up being a little longer for me i happen to like it because it gives it a little more formalness of a longer coat while still being spring weight jerseyterry on the,1
827,I found this dress on sale recently in store and it was in my size a p i tried it on and it fits perfectly for my d and ft frame since i found it in store and it is an older dress there are some frays in the threading probably from being shipped handled etc i still bought it for the sale price i look forward to wearing it out,1
828,I love this dress saw it online and went to try it on in the store the next day this dress is perfect the pattern stands out but isnt too overwhelming im lbs and ddd i bought an xs and i love the fit its just the right amount of fabric to be flowy without being excessive one thing ive found with flowy dresses is they make you look preggers if you have a large bust however this dress is nothing of the sort seriously if you find your size in stock snatch it up,1
829,This sweater is very pretty i had my concerns being that i dont normally pay for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come,1
830,As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back,0
831,This dress i received is stylish comfortable and very nice to wear i love the length goes just below the knee and i am so it is perfect for me i cant say enough about this dress as i cant wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know thank you retailer for this beauty,1
832,This is longer than i thought it would be but again im petite i ordered the grey and its more of a grey green color that is absolutely beautiful it is such a cute and easy top to wear,1
833,This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen the color and fit is exactly as on the model there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it it is tts in my opinion although the buttons on the back add a nice flair they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so thats why i gave it stars for design,1
834,Love this versatile cardigan have both blue orange colors theyre beautiful its light weight yet cozy true to size but the sleeves are a little snug so if you like roomier sleeves size up,1
835,This dress is flattering and seems to be made well the polka dots add interest i am usually a and did go up to a in this,1
836,This has a nice vintage cut and soft feel with the metal detailing of a blinded out rock n roll tee its perfect with jeans a leather skirt or even lounge pants its a great top to throw in an overnight bag for a weekend away because its so versatile,1
837,I will be living in these this summer i couldnt find them in my local store so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater theyve already become my go to pants everyone should have a fun pair of,1

840,Love this piece i hope to see more cute fun dresses like this from retailer the greatest feature is it is super comfortable it could be worn to a great number of events dressed up or down for any occasion,1
841,I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits i find them very flattering and just universally appealing this one has beautiful summery design as well i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit i normally wear size us size of this suit but this particular design was too small and had to exchange for us which fits perfect,1
842,Great top lately ive been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure good tops but in this one the xs was best i bought this in colors and theyre my go to tanks for summer the mint is a bit sheer but not bad i did not get try the yellow or white one,1
843,Love these shorts got pairs on sale just because its hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length,1
844,childsize not sure where this went wrong but its going back immediately always wear a in retailerpologist skirts this size runs at least two sizes too small the material is beautiful but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric so disappointing,0
845,I wore this top recently and received several compliments its a great top with the off the shoulder trend plus you can wear a normal bra underneath runs large so i recommend one size down,1
846,These are simply the best of everything i love about charlie trousers great fit classic styling with the pop of the unexpected the fabric is thinner than it appearsperfect for spring and summer the pattern of the damask is not overwhelming but it works very well as a neutral if you want to mix patterns which i do a lot or if you want to pair it with an ivory blouse and a simple blue sweater or jacket roll down the pants for a more professional look during the day roll them up for ca,1
847,Simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and its a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but im sure the regular wouldve been fine looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram,1
848,This is my first pair of pilcro pants but defiantly not my last i always have a hard time trying to decide between a regular length and a tall because at i usually fall somewhere in between i ordered the regular length and couldnt b happier they are just long enough to wear a shorter heal with or a pair of flats the beige color is really nice and pairs nicely with the sky blue mock turtleneck sweater i also ordered from retailer i love the retro s style too i couldnt be happier wi,1
849,I tried this on in the sotre in balck as i was planning on ordering the orangey onemy usual is or sometimes petites i thought the regular was sjut fine and flattering fabric is soft adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice no orangered though was not overly snug anywhere and i am a bit braod for my sizei deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month multiple purcahses and this was one of i had to pick if it goes on sal,1
850,Les fauves is another version of last years larkhill swing dress but better one the swing has less to swing but in a good way they reduced the voluminous amount of material while retaining the fun swing aspect two the dress is shorter so its more flattering to the vertically challenged like me whats the same still wonderful silk discreet pockets beautiful abstract floral print and those horrid little buttons that are difficult to fasten on the back of a tight neckband collar i h,1
851,I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat im short but the petite was well above my knee i could have worn petite small just fine it fit nicely in the bodice the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais,1
852,Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days i love the squishy soft feel of the material it works well with sweaters love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet i love how simple and practical this coat is the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head,1
853,The slubbed palette tee fits perfectly its very comfortable and looks cute with jeans ill be ordering more in other colors i really like that its made in the us too,1
854,Beautiful detail sweater is warm soft and very comfortable fits perfectly i was worried without having seen it in person that the lace detailing would be fragile but it is knitted into the underlying sweater material i have worn it no less than five times already and not a flaw or a pull in it,1
855,The fabric pattern is darling i wore it in amsterdam and was told it looks like a traditional folk pattern the dress is lightweight and is loose at the waist sometimes i add a belt to cinch it inlike another reviewer said the buttons do pop off easily i lost one at the cuff on the first day i wore the dress,1
856,Sorry but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large as for sizing i purchased my usual size small the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust love the highlow hemline and the back isnt too tight across my bum ill also note that im years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics the seethrough factor is not an issue with this buttondown im,1
857,These chinos are the best the fit is always true to size the quality is great and the new fall colors are beautiful my favorite are the plum these are my goto pants,1
858,Love these leggings soft cozy and yummy feeling cant wait for the weather to get cooler these fleecelined leggings will be a new staple this winter,1
859,This is my favorite dress purchase so far in the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful it flares out a little but not too much order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist or if you have broad shoulders the larger of your typical size range im typically a p or a p with a p hip measurement a middle range p is p is waist measument and a p bust measurement but my shoulders are broad and athletic p the larger,1
860,I purchased my normal size small i loved the colors in the purple which are more blue and vibrant red to me this top is a nice soft fabric it will pair nice with denim jeans,1
861,I personally like light garment and simple design for my daily dresses it meets my needsi personally recommend it to customers,1
862,Good quality fit and length love them,1
863,Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses however this looks huge the material is not soft so it doesnt fall well it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant,0
864,Dress really pretty and great quality slip is small if large breasted,1
865,This long sleeved tee is soft and beautiful the swing design is so pretty and flattering the seams along the front and back are a lovely addition i also appreciate the higher neckline which is increasingly hard to find in these kind of tees would love it in more colors i bought the black i tried the white as well but it was too transparent for this particular style and the tank top underneath gave it a sporty appearance not horrible but not what i wanted so the white went back,1
866,I bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months its so soft and cozy im tempted to keep it i got the xss regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist belly button and ive got a shorter torso and am i got this during the sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night more of a cab to curb piece,1
867,Love this sweater you can wear it with just about everything i have worn it with dresses leggings and jeans you can dress it up or down wonderful quality for the price,1
868,I bought this awesome jumpsuit and i love it i really dont like wearing one piece clothing but this one its just so comfy and it looks great i wear it with the straps or strapless and it looks different as you can wear it classy or casual and the best park it has side pockets the color is as the description navy blue and ivorycream pattern i wear a size and thats what i got when i bought this so pretty much to size for my liking,1
869,This dress first caught my eye online due to the price i resisted then i saw in store and tried oni decided to hold off for a sale but my will was getting thin once i saw it start to sell out online i had to take the plunge i knew this dress was a must have it is super flattering and comfy the best of both worlds im smallchested so both the s and m fit but the seam on the s fit a bit higher which was more flattering on me so s is what i got it can be dressed up or slightly down,1
870,I have been looking for lace shorts for years yes years finally found these shorts that are perfect the lace is sturdy not flimsy so they are not seethrough i purchased both the cream and the blue when they went on sale my skin is a bit tan so lightercolored clothing can be seethrough for me both colors are fantastic and i get compliments on them all the time especially the blue shorts plus they complement either a tshirt or a blouse i love the eyelash fringe at the hem such,1

873,I couldnt be happier with this top it is very flattering and not at all shapeless as suggested by another reviewerleast not on me yes the materiel is somewhat thin but it is advertised to be a tee shirt type material that is why it feels so comfortable on with nice stretch and softness i love the pleated back giving it neat detail and a added feminine touch i ordered the dark purple color and it looks just like in the photothanks retailer,1
874,I was so afraid to get a toosmall blazer based on other reviews that i ordered this two sizes up i am usually a or in a blazer and ordered a it was huge i then ordered a and it is just right its comfortable and chic and i love the blue and black combination,1
875,This sweater is a beautiful quality wellmade piece of art it looks on exactly like it looks online when i ordered it i was worried that my usual size xs might be too tight however it is a perfect fit it is fitted yet it still has a comfortable looseness with some extra room in the length of the arms for reference i am lbs the color is a perfect match to the pilcro serif navymarin leggings of course i am always apprehensive about stretching andor shrink,1

879,This top was supposed to be inches long in petite its actually inches long its also large in width hard to believe its an extra small petite,0
880,I am not a fan of unlined bras but this one was so pretty i had to try it the lace doesnt look cheap but overall i wouldnt have wanted to pay full price it fits well and the support offers a nice shape no cone i might go back for the other color,1
881,I am lb and an xs petitethe embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress but everything else was really unflattering the huge puffy sleeves especially another reviewer said this was more like a shift and she was right not worth the price on sale,0
882,This t shirt is very beautiful i absolutely love it it is soft and flattering and gorgeous perfect for work or play i washed it in gentle cycle cold water i meant to hang to dry but somehow it got in the dryer with towels i was heart sick when i saw it in a crumpled ball but it did not shrink nor wrinkle wow,1

885,These socks feel amazingi have them in both colorsyou would be surprised at the softness of these socks yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me i feel like these would last a long time with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spathese socks are softthese socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li,1

889,This blouse is romantic and timeless the tonal print is lovely the peplum cut flattering i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up which fits perfectly it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight thank you retailer for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath perfect for warm climates,1
890,The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward,0
891,When i saw this item online i ordered it right away loved the color and the oversized comfy look to it the pros very softthe color a deep cranberry as pictured the cons the low back in the photo the models arms cover it up when i put it on it looked like an oversized flap that stuck out on the sides and was very visible from the front and because the material is unstructured that made it look worse i loved it except for this one feature but because it was so detracting i had,0

894,Just received this dress in the mail its stunning the lace is just beautiful i ordered two sizes and had to size down a bit the fit is generous cant wait to wear this to my rehearsal dinner next week,1
895,Im in love with these tanks so in love that i bought four of them black grey blue and the black motif they are so flattering on i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own but also perfect for under a cardigan i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer which was made by velvet several months ago and it was much more pricey these are a much more affordable option,1
896,I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look but returned them because they fit weird too tight around the too high waistline and normally i like a high waistline fit ran small and the overall quality of the fabric wasnt as nice as i was hoping for pretty disappointed,0
897,Purchased this sweater in pink which is a beautiful blend of grey and pink i purchased my usual size xs and it fits great through the shoulders sleeves and body i did try on a s and the body was too boxy also i tried a couple of different ones in my xs along with other colors and found them to run a little differently so you may want to check this out the sweater is beautiful and easy to wear the zipper adds a unique detail which can be unzipped part way to show a tank or just to draw a,1
898,These pants are exactly what i expected true to size and color were perfect they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing perfect office attire or night out for dinner just add a fancier blouse ta da would highly recommend them,1
899,Ive been on the lookout for a great quality basic black and white stripe shirt its easy to find the super cheap ones that last you maybe four wears this one is great quality extremely soft and comfortable im usually a small in tops but got this in a medium so that it would fit like the model slightly loose i didnt want it body hugging so if youre looking for that fit go up a size it doesnt stretch out much,1
900,I loved this dress and the color i wanted to wear it to my nieces wedding i usually wear a medium but couldnt get it on the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didnt cut but the top was huge i really dont understand the sizing of this dress at all,0
901,Fabric is so comfy color is gorgeous fit is flattering for large chests,1
902,Tts im wearing a small the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants washed nicely layers flat to dry had to iron the shell underneath great for casual office,1
903,Dont pay attention to the lessthanflattering photo these jeans are super cute and very flattering they are actually long not ankle length as the photo implies high waisted with a s bell bottom vibe nice light denim for year round wear they fit like a dream,1
904,This skirt has a beautiful style cut and pattern i am so surprised it is on sale what a great price it has a medium sweater knit that is not clingy and has a slight flair looks great with boots,1
905,Love this can be a jacket or blazer syle fits well,1
906,I got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame but i had no problem with these at all i may go after the other colors,1
907,I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didnt need it on another visit i tried again and couldnt resist it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shortsjeanspants you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition,1
908,This product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing,1
909,Ive wondered abt this swtr but hesitated to order being it has dolman sleeves decided to wait for it to come in at the local store yesterday i spotted it in the store tried on the orange labeled red online i was really looking for the cream but the store did not have it well the orange is really much prettier in person fit is perfect in my usual size s overall body fit length is generous sleeves are wrist length im only most likely the sleeves will be shorter on taller,1
910,Took a chance without trying it on and ordered onlinei love everything about this sweater fit is on the spot details are pretty and wonderful try it you wont be disappointed,1
911,This sweater caught my eye while in the store shopping for a gift i am on the shorter size so i was worried that it would drown me it didnt it hits me mid thigh the sides are cut up high i will wear a cami or shirt under it super soft material flattering fit i have put on a little weight and this hides all the problem areas without looking frumpy thanks,1
912,This product is just what i wanted it was a great color and nice quality for the price it is tighter than the model but i am curvy and thats usually the case looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry,1
913,I cant rate this with enough stars or numbers great fit cant see up the sleeve perfect length just right amount of fabric for draping i am and lbs fits like a dream and when i got it home from the storeit goes with all things in the closet my one reservation is it only comes in one color lets get on it designers we need a lipstick red for summer and coral and navy and black and white i dont need any other top this one has great cool fabric and you dont need to wear,1
914,I was tempted to get this online but just wasnt sure i wanted to buy even with the sale because i only wear dresses to the knee and didnt know how this would look with leggings or jeans i tried it on in the store the next day and it was so cute there are long skinny black tassels in the front that you cant really see in the online pics that i love it looks great with my skinny jeans with tears or black leggings and boots i even have some cute leggings just past the knee that this looks aw,1
915,Got this in wine very pretty and soft but so sheer even with the dark color one would have to wear a cami returning for this reason having to wear a cami wrecks the otw ultracomfort,0
916,Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldnt be happier its stunning not sheer at all but light and breezy i typically wear a medium sometimes a small but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic which is what ive been looking for all spring the blue is even prettier in person a true blue a perfect find,1
917,I had been looking for this dress in xs the small ran large on me and xs had sold out online id been searching for it calling every store around and not having any luck when allison called me from store highland village in houston she had found the dress for me in the woodlands i was able to purchase it and i cant wait to get it it will be perfect for the hot summer here in texas thank you allison for such great customer service and retailer for employing such great staff,1
918,These are both adorable and practicaltheyre versatile enough to dress up or down and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures these will definitely be my goto tights this season,1
919,I get nervous ordering clothes online but that was my only option for this dress i love everything about this dress and i love the pockets,1
920,Awesome top slightly cropped great to dress up jeans or wear with pants or skirt for evening out,1
921,I am not sure why so many gave only stars yes this top is for a strapless bra my bra top where the strap starts was showing but so nice shape was ok for me it does go in at the hem givinng a bubblelike shape but its part of the charm i dndt experience the loose straps but didnt pay attention to that when i tried it on also didnt notice the stitching was red in the store but checked and yes thats true love itnot an online exclusive as it was in my store i pur,1
922,My favorite leggings they are feminine and perfect with a long tee the colors are vibrant the material is high quality plus theyre comfy i ordered an xs im and lbs,1
923,I love this dress i was worried it would swallow my petite frame but it is flowy yet flattering i have worn it to several different occasions it looks great with tights and boots and just flats the lace detailing makes it unique,1
924,These shorts are great perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up i love all the colors ive bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are,1
925,This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back,1
926,Not usually one for a turtleneck even a mock turtleneck but this so soft and did not fit super tight around the neck so i bought it then i bought the other one because i loved it so much my only gripe is that i wish it was a smidge longer i am lbs curvyathletic build c and the small fit perfect,1
927,This was way too big on me so i gave it to a friend not only does it fit her really well and look great but it has become her new favorite sweater love the casual everyday style and am tempted to order one in a smaller size for myself,1
928,I wanted to love this product so badly i ordered it in the mail and it looked beautiful coming out of the box i normally look really nice in grey but this color really washed me out and was not nice on the fabric is very sheer so you would have to wear it over a camisoletank top this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person large in arms small on body odd fit,0
929,I love these pants i have them in navy and carbon the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy they loosen up as the day goes on as well super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break,1
930,Oh i simply cant say enough about this dress its just so pretty ive sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress its a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft really flattering you can dress it up or down as well im glad ill be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket,1
931,I bought this in black and the checkered pattern love both very floaty and feminine fits true to size,1
932,I just purchased this dress yesterday in the navy for my anniversary next month i have to say its totally stunning on the embroidery is beautiful extremely figure flattering and the dress is very well constructed i have to disagree with other reviews who say it doesnt or wont work for bustier women i am a d tall and normally wear a size the fits perfectly and the deep vlike neckline creates a very nice bit of cleavage maybe too much for some at the office i would say but,1
933,This dress is great and looks even prettier in person the colors are more vibrant the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect most maxis are too long on me but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect my only complaint is that it is very low cut which i was unaware of standing up but when i sat down at a dinner party well lets just say i gave everyone a show recommend wearing a cami or something underneath,1
934,This dress has all the hallmarks of a classic the fit of the bodice is form enhancing but modest and the flare is very feminine and swingy i love the soft denim fabric though it smelled funny out of the package and i had to air it out i am dd and bought the size,1
935,This is a beautiful dress the embroidery is really lovely in person i find that this brand runs a bit small usually i am usually an but had to go up to a to fit my hips i am a little bit pear shaped so that might be why,1
936,These are amazing quality i agree size up to not have such a sheer effect i would not wear them as just leggings without a long shirt covering the buttthey are warm i wore them under some ski stuff kept me warmi also washed them on handwash cycle seemed to be ok,1
937,I love this cardigan i ordered the pink and its a really pretty color i wish it didnt run so big but xs will be cozy all winter,1
938,Love this top got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans shorts cropssome say its a little short and boxy while the style is cut larger i wouldnt call it boxy and i definitely didnt find it to run short a great staple wish it came in other colors besides white and blackgray,1
939,A beautiful classiclove the denim fabric in such a pretty stylethis top has a more flattering fit than appears in the picsthe fabric is soft and the fit very flatteringordered my usual size medium and fits perfectlyvery true to size,1
940,Normally i would not have bought this color and print it is just not a color that i usually wear but after reading reviews i ordered it online i love love this top it looks good is flattering and is a very nice and different color i wore it with berry leggings and love it the top is very comfortable can be worn with pants and leggings the only issue i have is that since the jersey fabric is only at the back and not in the front it pulls at the tummy section in the front and shows an o,1
941,I am a petite person with broad shoulders and got this in a size small i absolutely love it it is similar to how it looks online but is even better in person you could wear this with just about anything so glad i bought it,1
942,These pants are amazing i usually have a hard time finding ones to fit me due to my small size lbs but the fit me perfectly they are not too tight just slim enough without clinging to you like a second skin love the length hits just above the ankle bone versatile and comfortable however if i were any heavier i cannot say these pants would work i am fairly thin in most cases i would size up,1
943,This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections but not too heavy length as shown on model,1
944,Absolutely adore this jacket im typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be so perfect and beautiful the embroidery is gorgeous i feel so feminine in this coat,1
945,This top runs large i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review i ordered a small and it was the right decision i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso love the back detail and the print and color is really nice,1
946,This is a great skirt to add to your closet i love it it is comfortable soft and has detail to it i enjoy wearing it for work or a night out,1
947,Its a casual dress with a luxurious feel very flowy but the back panel gives it a bit more structure i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps i will very much appreciate it on hot days im anticipating a big of headache when ironing it but i appreciate that its not dry clean only im on the shorter side of average height and it hits me midthigh,1
948,Tts and very very sleek and flattering just love for summer nice light weight feel great on and not saggy nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue,1
949,This has a wonderful texture and feel to it the leather dots are supple and the tulle is soft and flowey its long more like a midi skirt and the color is more towards taupe than ivorywith a shimmer this skirt is very fun to wear,1
950,I bought this top in navy and am so happy with my purchase its pretty and feminine it looks great with jeans as well dressing it up for work very happy with this purchase,1
951,I saw this online first and didnt care for it then i saw it instore and purchased it with little memory of the online experience because the dress is that much better in person its nearly seasonless looks great with fall boots and has garnered many compliments this is one of those that the internet cant really do justice to i withhold a star for quality since the snapin keeps for the slip were confusing and maybe its just the one i bought one of the keeps was detached from the,1
952,Very pretty dress wearing it for a family beach portrait it may run a little big but not terribly it is also not super long as pictured im and its perfect with a flat,1
953,I tried this top on at store and didnt want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was it is even cuter on so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional off i immediately ordered it is flowy comfortable and fun wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest,1
954,As others mentioned the arm holes are a bit large but i didnt find this too much of a problem possibly thats because as a smaller chested woman i run into that issue regularly im and the size fit perfectly the length is at the top of knee,1
955,Like other reviewers i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it well i am very disappointed the colors arent as rich as the outdoor photo although theyre brighter than shown in the studio photos this is just not a flattering dress ive put it on three times and taken it back off the neck is too high the sleeves are too narrow and i have really skinny arms and theres no swing to it i am and weigh pounds and bought a size small which is what,0
956,Love these jeans flattering and comfortable great length for short girl worth the money,1
957,Very cute true to size,1
958,I desperately needed some new work clothes so i ordered this and a few other shirts online this was the only one that fit me really well and that i really liked its a bit pricey for a tanktop but it feels really well made the material is soft and comfortable and the ruffle details and the print are beautiful the small fits me perfectly lbs a and its not short like a lot of other shirts i try on which my coworkers probably appreciate since no one wants to see me flashing,1
959,I love these pants i vary between the fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom so many colors to coordinate with these pants teal green retailer yellow blacki am not fond of ankle pants prefer longer pants i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made removing the cuff tacks was a challenge perfect pants for those of us who have shape,1
960,Im in love with this top looks just like it does in the photos except the colors are maybe a little more vibrant its definitely boxy so you may not like it if boxy isnt your thing but i think the pattern placement really works with the boxy shape i usually wear a small in tops and the xss fits great its also machine wash and tumble dry which is a plus although i havent washed it yet unique chic and effortlessorder before its gone,1
961,These got me so excited for fall the teal is a color im really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these when they arrived though i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch the fit is snug but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable these will be a staple in my wardrobe i want to order more colors,1
962,The design of these ankles pants is very cool and the rise is perfect however the fabric despite spandex has absolutely no give from the knee down the extensive stitching probably contributes to the lack of stretch while i was able to pull them on size for lb i could not bend my legs at the knee comfortably with longer wear i think they would cut off the circulationplease post if these stretch for you enough with wear and become softer,0
963,This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable i got a size and probably could have gotten away with an but due to being busty on top stuck with the i love the length even though i got the regular and not the petite,1
964,Ive been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing i went with my pants size and it looks great i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering i found the size up was loose in the bust for me go for it its the cutest suit ever,1
965,This suit did nothing for me the top has zero support this would work for a younger woman who does not require any support and is smaller chested also the top gapped in the center it just did not fit right the top is very thin showing everything a light padding would make a big difference in this suit also i could not get a good fit as i tightened the top the back would ride up the bottoms are ok not renatkable,0
966,I love this top ive washed it a couple of times now and i can say it holds pretty well unlike what another reviewer said its very good quality for me it is true to size im lbs b and the small was perfect i wear it with a strapless bra overall a great purchase that i can pair with almost anything,1
967,This top is way more sparkly and festive in person i plan to pair it with black or charcoal gray pants for a holiday party but it would also go great with dark jeans it is super cute cant wait to wear it,1
968,I wasnt sure about this top online in the picture it sort of looks like it juts out after the tie but the reviews said it was really soft and flattering on i wasnt sure exactly how the sizing translated numbers vs letters so i ventured into the store i am normally either an xxs or xs in most retailer tops i went with size i think i would have been ok in the but it might have gotten a bit snug in the shoulder area sizing down and with the front tie it can be cinched in to create,1
969,I bought this top for my daughter and it looks beautiful its a pretty jade green color and has a nice flow to it the back is very flattering as well,1
970,The quality of the fabric is good but the fit is horrible unflattering and strange definitely a pass,0
971,This top is a must have for summer it is light and accentuates the figure im and many tops overwhelm me but this is shorter in the front and a touch longer in the back the cotton is very nice and it has a somewhat wider hem if you have hips this somehow makes them look narrowerif they had additional colors i would have bought them all im a c and the size was perfect,1
972,I was excited to see this top ordered it and was disappointed it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom i tried this on times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments no luck,0
973,I ordered this dress online the previous reviews were accurate that it runs small particularly in the waist i normally wear a or but i ordered the it fit my waist and hips but was slightly loose at the top even though i am a c i liked the look but it had a hole where the seams had come apart between the black stripe across the chest and the main fabric additionally the black squares were pulled in several places with threads sticking out i returned it immediately,0
974,The picture doesnt do it justice i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing the fit is true to size i am large chested but it fit comfortablei did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest still looks amazing i feel very feminine in this blouse good quality material,1
975,This sweater fits differently than it looks on the model in the photo it is more fitted less bell sleeve and the neck is less boatneck on me i am often between sizes at retailer but in this one i got the larger size and it fits well i love this sweater i just wanted to mention that i think it fits differently than what it looks like in the pic,1
976,I highly recommend this dress it is super flattering and i got so many compliments it fits like a glove and honestly made me look lbs thinner very romantic and has great movement the length is perfect since the top is quite modest its nice that its on the shorter side makes it a little flirty i wasnt sure of the pattern at first but it fit so perfectly that i overlooked it and bought it anyway by the end of the night i was in love with the pattern it really stood out and i can,1
977,This is such a cute jumper i bought it to wear to a beach wedding i took a chance trying on a medium im a true large and was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit very excited to add this to my springsummer repertoire,1
978,This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture the colors are soft and feminine medium fit me perfectly this is the soft cuddly sweater i have been looking for,1
979,I love this sweater coat the buttons make it more structured and practical when the weather is coolthe colors are even nicer in person the neutral yellow is sure to compliment a lotyou would be disappointed with this purchase,1
980,Im very disappointed in the quality it seems more like a pajama than a tunic definitely not worth dollars i plan to return it,0
981,I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color ladies with hips or a booty bewarethis looked horrible on me it clung to my butt and didnt hang nice and straight like it does in this picture i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it,0
982,This top is much more beautiful in person than in the photo the embroidery is exquisite and there is the tiniest bit of sparkle amidst the design soft flowing and flattering definitely a keeper,1
983,Got this shirt on sale and i hope they restock so i can buy more super comfy and flattering at the same time i have some extra baby weight and it camouflages that well im normally a but im an right now and the medium was perfect im and its plenty long enough to wear with leggings a great shirt and ill be sure to watch out for this one to come back please restock,1
984,Gorgeous color and great price but too low cut and because of the design a camis wouldnt work disappointed,0
985,Despite being a knit this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable,1
986,I tried this one twice in the same day the first time i didnt like it the stylist in the dressing room at the time dindt etiher but then my favorite stylist finally showed up and i tried it on again but at the time had changed pants made all the difference you really need hte right pants for htis but it is gorgeousi bought hte black color online i liked it better the white has stell colored polka dots so if you want more of a spring color also good for youstyle ca,1
987,The beadwork is gorgeous but the sleeves are so puffy it looks as though youre wearing shoulder pads the fabric of the shirt isnt that fabulous either,0
988,I love these they are so soft the high waist is awesome and fits like a glove they dont stretch out i wear with a heel and get tons of compliments they make my hips look smaller than they are,1
989,I walked into a local retailer store and saw these pants talk about love at first sight they have an amazing look and fit usually i have to buy petitesized pants but the length fit at my ankle and i like the look better than what is shown since it is still summer i paired the pants with a cute white tank and black flip flops but cant wait to mix it up with a cute bootie and sweater,1
990,This dress fits perfectly and is travels wonderfully through the seasons the color and cut is really flattering and flows nicely,1
991,Pilcro is an incredible denim brand and ive never been disappointed these are no exception minimal distress perfect length im and they hit just like the model great color and super comfy they have some stretch to them and definitely fit baggier so depending on how you want them to fiti sized down for a snugger fit these are fantastic,1
992,This top is super cute nice and light for the hot weather with a tts fit the model is wearing a lightcolored bra so it shows through but with a black bra there is no problem,1
993,Disappointing back is yellowish and looks strange the front view is cute but doesnt match the fabric on the back at all cant imagine why you would do that,0
994,Love this dress from the great fabric soft yet substantial thats similar to sweater material to the amazing detail of the flower design its really so unique and i mean that in a good way to the color a tan with gold flecking and lastly to the really flattering fit not to mention those retro bell sleeves all around a fun dress it was true to size and not too short hitting my height about above my knees,1
995,This is such a gorgeous shade of indigo i was instantly attracted to it upon trying on i was surprised at how soft the fabric was definitely a cozy sweatshirt feel in disguise i love the peplum detailing and found the xs to be just right in length to my hip and everywhere else i cant wait for it to cool off here in new england so i can wear this beautiful top i anticipate many compliments on s lovely top,1
996,I love this item they hang flow beautifully like the weightlessness of a silk skirtthe front peekaboo cut outs really make them a delight to wear show off some skinsomewhat transparenti topped it off with a lightweight tunic length for modesty but the placement of the painterly design really works in my favor so i could wear them with something shorter if i choose to like the modelheads turned as i walked by,1
997,Ive never spent this much money on a sweater but took the plunge using the retailer day discount still painful but hopeful it would be worth it i ordered the xl hoping to compensate for the shorter length and it fell just below my hip bones so that part was okay while this looks like the cashmere is on the thinner side so the garment flows nicely its not the weight of the sweater is substantial heavier and much thicker than it looks the color is different too its tan and grey not whi,0
998,This dress is really beautiful i was looking for something to wear to a summer oclock wedding and this dress will work perfectly the fabric is smooth and has a tiny bit of sheen to it which makes it look a little nicer and more formal however you can easily dress it down my only issue was the length im and this dress was way too long definitely need to take off about or inches i also had to size up i could have tried the petite but it fit so well everywhere except length,1
999,I usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue i am broad shoulders i ordered both the sp the mp i tried on the small petite first and it was too tight in the shouldersarm that was without lifting my arms forward or up i tried on the mp and it was perfect i would have to say this is my favorite fall top so far the color is very pretty more of a lavender than pink the lace detail is delicate and pretty the top is more like a tunic get the petite if you short,1
1000,I purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit i love the top and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style alas the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough even though these are very comfortable leggings i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue,1
1001,Super soft flannel material the colors are beautiful and perfect for fall its doesnt ride up the shoulders but stays in place offtheshoulder style i love it,1
1002,The picture doesnt do this blouse any justice the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop,1
1003,Love the contrast of fabrics thick and thin comfy like a favorite sweatshirt but with style can be worn both on a night out or curled up on the sofa watching a movie at home,1
1004,Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments true to size its not thick but its very warm,0
1005,This dress is beautiful and unique the cutouts and lace really stand out however the dress was huge on me and that is rare with moulinette souers i usually get a or p in this brand due to the bust sizing being generally smaller but the regular was huge and the armholes really big the petite may have been better but felt that it would have been too short while the design is beautiful there were several areas on the dress where the threads were unraveling for reference i am waist,0
1006,I am not usually one for super girly tops but i could not resist this top the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down i think it is extremely versatile it is a little bit seethrough but if you just wear a nude bra its perfect i usually wear a or but i got a in this top because it is a little tight in the sleevesacross the shoulders but if you size up you should be perfect super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out,1
1007,This skirt is beautiful fabric is gorgeouswith perfect amount of shine and luxury to it there is a life in this skirt it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way ori better say it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it unfortunately it stretched more than a full size and generally lost its shape now the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore,0
1008,I got this sweater in navy and it is much cuter than online it is a great transition sweater and also i can see it used on cool nights at the beach i have worn in professional environment to work as well as with a tee and jeans i love it,1
1009,Retailer has the greatest pencil skirts i usually get every year the pattern on this one makes it very eye catching with blue birds on green or tan background and black and white flowers in a tree pattern so it is versatile to wear with many colored topsi bought a large because they didnt have medium in the store it is a bit loose in the waist but comfortable the rest fits nice and slim i am usually an in jeans,1
1010,I took advantage of the sale this weekend purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase its so soft fits tts i just cant wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it,1
1011,Yay i found it my goto dress for this summer its perfect for casual daytoday stuff as well as summer festivals nights out travel etc i love the design length and fit its a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size the laceup front gives it a sexy corsettype bodice but in a very casual appropriate way i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages its flattering for us curvier ladies,1
1012,Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering paired with a skirt jeans or cropped black pants this top is perfect the cut in the front is not overly deep so a cami is not necessary i am usually a l or xl or in retailer tops and i have a in this top so it is sized slightly larger than usual,1
1013,This dress is gorgeous flattering comfortable and machine washablefor reference i am lbs and dd i got the medium and it fits great only flaw is that the armholes are a little large but not enough that my bra shows so i am okay with it,1
1014,Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe but it was not a deal breaker loved that it was lined and though feeling substantial was not heavy and thus comfortable in degree weather looking forward to wearing this again,1
1015,This is the softest cardigan i own perfect for lounging going to from yoga or dressing it up with a statement piece or a scarf ive worn it buttoned or open and receive many compliments i have it hanging on the inside of my closet door because i wear it more than anything else at the moment,1
1016,This dress is beautiful and timeless i wore it to a wedding and received so many compliments i love how i can also wear it to so many other engagements i plan to wear it for mothers day brunch a friends wedding shower and know that the clasic cut will be a staple in my closet for years to come the quality is what you expect for the price and is well worth your investment,1
1017,I love eva franco this is a very poor version bias seams are puckery zipper is bubbled felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed,0
1018,I love these pilcro pants i had them in two colors both beige and khaki super comfy and they stretch out a little around the waist with wearing however i recently ruined both sets in the wash because i used a stainstick remover to try to get some grease spots out of them the stain stick instead lifted the dye off of them now i have two sets of pants with odd light splotches on themso sad they arent more colorfast,1
1019,Just bought this and am in love with it its a really nice weight light for spring the drapey fit is very flattering its longer in the back than in the front and has a nice swing to it cant wait to wear iti tried on the tee in the lighter color and didnt care for it much i liked the contrast of the black and silver stripes,1
1020,These jeans are perfect in every way i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on they look great highly recommend,1
1021,Really great best nice substantial material and great fit will be able to wear with many things,1
1022,If youve been an retailer lover for awhile you have at least one of the left of center thermals every single year they come out with them and they are best sellers so when i saw this is couldnt believe it its just like the left of center thermal shirt but a cardigan soft warm but thin enough that it would be a perfect layer for the summer be warned that this fabric does grow with wear definitely size down a bit the body is full and the sleeves are fitted lots of stretch and very v,1
1023,The skirt is comfortable and as pictured it also ran tts im tall and weigh lbs i had the medium and didnt need to size up to a large when you put the skirt on a normal body it looks like you are wearing an easter egg and not in a good way,0
1024,I promised myself only one pair of joggers this year and these were the ones i went with in the blue motif for me the tipping point was the quality and fit of these were far superior than the others i tried while still being machine washable the fabric has aa little substance yet is still lightweight and comfortable the fit has a perfect bit of tailoringtapering to be ultraflattering while having the comfort of pajama pants the blue motif is adorable too love the geometric shapes l,1
1025,I love this blouse because its great for work with cardigan over it and great for going out with skirt pants or jeans it is tts and very flattering light weight and comfortable,1
1026,Amazing style great fabric and a dress for all occasions bought the black and love it,1
1027,Im a c and lbs the dress falls just below my knees perfect for the colder weather i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable i continue to find maeve dresses classic quality flattering and comfortable,1
1028,I ordered this blazer so i could look more puttogether for work but still feel comfortable it checks both of those boxes its almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure and has a great cutstyle my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes but the white part is actually a light heathered gray i think i would have preferred white but i still like it enough to keep got my normal size small which fit great,1
1029,Oh such a classic retailer look for summer a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric i was immediately drawn to it but wait there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist creating the look of an apron yes it looks like one is wearing a full apron or scrub dress why this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirtblouse combo,0
1030,This sweater is soft and comfortable its the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and in winter can be easily layered at its a little large and could have sized down to an extra small petite but still love it,1
1031,The design is very strange the inner slip is quite formfitting but the dress on top was just massive like a sack on the sides were tassels that i could not figure out what to do with they looked weird just hanging off the side so i tried to knot them like a belt overall this dress was not attractive on it looks much better on the model the coloring on the snakeskin print dress is also different in real life harsher red blue and white print not the dusty rose and plum pictured,0
1032,This dress is short but super flattering i was surprised when i tried it on instore that i liked it as much as i did the lace detail around the neck is unique and beautiful im dd and the small fits perfectly its easy to wear and can be dressed down with tights and boots or dressed up,1
1033,One in every fifteen items of retailer clothing fits this jacket is one easy to grab and keep chill away hood snuggles up as cozy collar when not worn up model in photo must have orangutan arms sleeves hit at wrist on this wearer with shortish armsboiled wool fabric is light which is great for layering lovely transition fall to winter transition piece statement jacket that will live on next season and beyondthank you rosie neira,1
1034,I look at the top quite a few times before i bought it i absolutely love it its a super soft thick cotton material it drapes perfectly and wears well,1
1035,Thanks to the vertical stripes the adjustable neckline the bow that cinches the waist and the free flowing skirt this dress is extremely flattering the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear eitheror depending on the dress style due to my hips i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me i just,1
1036,Lovely sweater its a new staple in my wardrobe love the fit and styling but what drew me in at first sight were the colors its warm and cuddly,1
1037,I tried on the petite size in my usual xs adn i actually have to go down to xxs i looked overtaken by the shirt im and lbscut is flowy and not close to the body sleeves are narrower but still ok with athletic builtcolor light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair but for my pale self the darker one was better but cant go wrong i ordered both colors and liked both of themruffle is a great addition too,1
1038,Weather changes during a day to extremes in nela lightweight cardigan for when little is needed thats pretty and practical if you take a close look at photo you will see the weave is open so could snag nothing hidden it is what it ispretty lacy feminine,1
1039,I bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever i let my sisters try it on too to see if they wanted it or liked it better but it was awful on them as well i ordered the xs in blue it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering i am and i love swing dressesi just dont think is cut well,0
1040,I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints i think its a lot of fun not so fun to put on but its worth the trouble i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself i also own the mona dress in p but i had to size down to a for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much,1
1041,This dress is very versatile it will be cool and comfortable in the summer but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket it can be worn casually with a belt or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out the black color is more like a charcoal grey which suits me fine grab it while you can its a good deal for the current sale on sale price,1
1042,I got the top in green it is very soft and comfy it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt,1
1043,I have pairs of these chinos i love them so much they come soft like a wellworn favorite but are high quality at a great price im typically a size i bought the size but think i could have gone down to a otherwise very happy with this purchase,1
1044,These are the cutest pants ever they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for springsummer sadly i have to return them because they are huge i generally wear an xs in retailer and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants i wish they made an xxs if you size down at least one size they are adorable,1
1045,Great dress fits perfectly will be perfect in the winter and with leggings,1
1046,So beautiful i got the xs and it fits tts it goes with everything perfect weekend addition,1
1047,This is so ridiculously soft and conformable it can be worn over workout clothes or with skinnies or leggings it looks fabulous either way i wear mine the way the customer photo is shown meaning folded over but it looks great either way the green is such a nice neutral it looks great with black or shades of brown tan or even grey the functional pockets are such a nice touchmy only criticism is this is a dolmanstyledrop hem sleeve which i am not a huge fan of bu,1
1048,I got this top in an xs and the fit is great the top is a little darker than pictured it looks great with white kaki and denim,1
1049,The dress is exactly as pictured i bought it for work and it is perfect the lining is the entire length of the dress and it hits just at the knee i would say it is true to size however it was a bit tight in my shoulders but i have very broad shoulders i received compliments all day and remarked to myself it was so comfortable it was like wearing pajamas,1
1050,I normally wear a size but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size and so i went with a size for this purchase they fit perfectly i would have liked to order the petite but it did not appear to be an option the fabric is very soft and stretchy they are little loose around the ankle but i have very skinny calves and ankles so that is not so surprising the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything i would buy these in other colors,1
1051,This dress is beautifully made but it does not flair slightly as in the photo it stick out like a tent it might be a good maternity dress the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture,0
1052,This shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain long sleeve black top look elegant the material on the shirt is pretty light so it is for fall or spring,1
1053,These were perfect in the legs nice and stretchy but problematic in the waist im generally a size but i had to squeeze to get them to closetheyve already gone back if you have a tinier waist theyd probably be fine,0
1054,This is a great looking top in person ive worn this with jeans or skirts for different looks and its cute both ways i would order a size up though as it is not a flexible fabric so the shoulderschest area need a little room to move comfortably,1
1055,I received this dress as a birthday gift and am completely in love with it there are some things about it that i wish id known but are by no means deal breakers first you can kind of see this in the model shot the keyhole neckline is not sewn shut at all its completely open it didnt cause problems for me but some women may not be comfortable with that my dress didnt have any zippers and so was a pullover the band that runs around the waist has little to no stretch so you have t,1
1056,I bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaidthis is true to size and adorable i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge adorable detailing on back and on shouldersits a keeper,1
1057,I wanted to love this sweater the color is gorgeous the pattern unusual it is soft and warm and would have gone with so many things but the cut is awful mainly the sleeves are way too big making me look misshapen and my arms look huge the body was a bit boxy but that would have been workable if the arms had been normal too bad,0
1058,I saw these in the store and was smitten ordered online and have not been disappointed love the pattern the feel and the fit comfortable fun and interesting the regular length ones are definitely fulllength on me but not too long i might have gone with the petite length except that they didnt seem available but am perfectly happy with the regular length,1
1059,What a sweet shirt the ski pattern is adorable and they have a cute cat pattern that ive only seen so far in the store the fit is small i sized up from my normal to a but could have even gone to a as there wasnt much difference between the and the except in length,1
1060,Cant wait to wear this during the holidays beautiful embroidery and detailing,1
1061,Great transitional top comfy and great fit i like my tops to be somewhat roomy and this was great in a small i usually buy medium,1
1062,Finally a swing top that doesnt look like a sack on me ive been wanting to partake of this current style but everything ive tried so far just looks dumpy on me not this top it is very feminine and flattering i am lbs and have a small waist and although this is a swing style it still shows my waist and doesnt overpower me it is also a lovely fabric especially in the soft pink which i got im thinking of going back for more colors,1
1063,Its really not in my typical wheelhouse i took a chance based on reviews the shorts are long and roomy enough and i love it with the longsleeves i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point thats a bummer,1
1064,A swing top by tiny done right this is a well made top that fits in all the right places no gapping arm pit the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size you may have to go down two sizes i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother,1
1065,Soft lightweight comfortable i wore this as soon as i got it and have received many compliments on the style and color super soft love the angled zipper and sleeve length is long enough to be comfortable great cool weather jacket,1
1066,Most often complimented item of this springs wardrobe,1
1067,This yellowmango color is so beautiful in person i actually dont have the best skin tone for shades of yellow but i couldnt resist trying this one on it turned out to be perfect the silhouette is very feminine especially around the neckline shoulders there is a lot of fabric but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive finally the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it looking forward to summer,1
1068,I love the flowybeachy look of this jumpsuit it is very comfortable and super cute my only gripe is that the hip part is pretty wide hands in the pockets you cant tell but if i were to get this i would want a xxs length was ok not petite since it is a flowy look colors are very nice too kind of s but i love it i think i will get this if it goes to sale even if it is a little big on me i am lbs d chest and tried on xs,1
1069,These pants are a must for any girls summer warm weather wardrobe i tried them on in the store and loved them but i am just over and they were too long in the xs even with inch heels so i ordered them in an xs petite and they are perfect with my inch heels i love that they are widelegged they look cool and are flattering i am a teacher and plan on wearing them to work during the warmer months with a nice solid tee and a statement necklace and of course heels i highl,1
1070,I debated getting this top and i am glad that i did i got the pink and it is a fun vibrant color someone suggested that if you are in between sizes go up i agree with that feeling however it is pretty true to size it is preppy cute and classic,1
1071,Way too much fabric sticks out like jodhpurs but from the hip eek might be a great dress in rayon or a drapey fabric but the extra fabric just piles up on itself the outer layer also doesnt feel like it will breath add the cotton lining and i think it will feel miserable in the heat of the texas summer returning,0
1072,This dress is truly a no brainer purchase it is a stunning dress with gorgeous embroidery beading and the color is just perfect for fall i am only and i went with the regular size since i dont like to go too short that said you can totally rock this dress with leggings and boots if it is too short i weigh lbs and i am normally an xxs but im glad i went with the xs since it would have been too tight at the top and should even be slightly loose fitting on the bottom love everyth,1

1076,Love love love like another chambray item i have they feel stuff and rough after washing but once you put them on they soften up and look great,1
1077,Usually wear a small sometimes medium bought this in medium and am very happy with it formfitting but not too tight would probably fit well in a small if i was in better shape it does show any flaws so the medium is more forgiving bought the black and am considering the neutral stripe this is a great medium weight top for cooler days the snap collar looks nice open i plan on washing on delicate and hanging up to dry i never dry clean anything except wool suits and coats,1
1078,This is a pretty blouse but everything else you wear with it needs to be sharp because it can be dowdy otherwise,1
1079,Wish i would have bought them in every color love,1
1080,I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasnt sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online but the print is beautiful its a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest i like that it has enough coverage at the top front and back the underarms do not fall very low and it is lined the aline skirt will flatter most body types the fabric and overall q,1
1081,I purchased this in london early april and i wore it to a summer wedding it was perfect and hangs very nicely the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture the front slit goes up to about the knee but doesnt split apart when walking which i appreciated the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve a definite keep,1
1082,Super cute great for a casual summer day fabric is nice and light and honey color goes well with denim kaki or olive green runs a little large but still looks good especially with fitted jeans or capri pants,1
1083,This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs ones cure beautifully the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting i am lbs tried it in the navybeige color in size s and size xs and i found size xs fits better the fabric is soft and stretchy and it drapes well because i am petite the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt it goes all the way down to my mid calf unfortunately the petite xs is sold out so i have to settle with the normal size xs sti,1
1084,Love this its heavywarm stylish and a great throw on any outfit oversized style,1
1085,I like the light fabric and embroidery on a otherwise hard look bomber feminine can be worn casually with jeans and a tshirt or over a dress lovely on every note fit i ordered botih the xxs p and xsp had tried on regular xs in store tried on the xxsp first and kept it didnt try on xs p since the fit is loose bomber on me i like it a little more fitted there is enough room for a sweater i am lbs dd in waist arms were not too snug either,1
1086,I was very excited to order this top in red xs so cute but it was huge shapeless and support thin it had to go back i shouldve looked at other reviews,0
1087,I tried this skirt on in a size medium i am usually a small inches around the hips and butt but there were no size smalls the medium looked good but the waistline may have been a tad loose the texture of the skirt is wonderful and it is lined overall the quality seemed good and it had a nice heft to it the only thing i might say is that is is quite longcloser to my ankles and im just shy of and leggy to boot i wear a inseam with flats with tall boots on you saw j,1
1088,I really like this dressshirt its great for layering super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this years pregnancy weight gain i think it will be so cute with some leggings and bootsunfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size this may sound weird but ive tried on an and a and the ability to reach forward didnt change between the two sizes i just returned the and am hopeful the i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back,0
1089,Beautiful dress but has an unflattering fit i purchased an xs and its past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy would be a perfect maternity dress though,0
1090,Ive always had great difficulty finding a pair of shorts that i like the fit of most are either too short too thin too low or too tight i have athletic legs that mainstream fit doesnt work well with for the most partfortunately that was not the case with the neda shorts i was first drawn to them because of the striking but subtle pattern and they also fit well with a good length and a structured fit they have a mediumhigh waistband and a slight stretchiness and the fabric,1
1091,Cutest dress i own very flattering makes your waist look tiny,1
1092,I absolutely love these pants they are super comfortable lightweight have big pockets and are so cute can wear them anywhere im taking mine to india next week,1
1093,Ive been looking for a leather or faux leather jacket for years and years and this is the first one that ive ever loved so much the style is edgy and modern yet still feminine and flattering love the cut of the jacket so flattering looks amazing with dresses skirts or denim i got the dark red color and its much more brown and neutral than it appears online i would love to get the tan color as well but its currently sold out in my size the faux leather looks believable and expensiv,1
1094,Absolutely love this sweater because it is so pretty while being soft and comfortable i am and purchased the smallit falls a little below my hips while the color matches everything the pockets and details add a nice touch and the longer sleeves are cozy the only drawback is it pills and sheds,1
1095,This is huge i understand thats the style but it looked like i was wearing my husbands size xxl i tried to imagine a really cold day when all that extra fabric would be nice but then it started to itch and itch and itch,0
1096,I love this dress i didnt think that i would feel at ease as it is very formfitting but it is so comfortable and warm it is dressy yet casual i have received many compliments,1
1097,Very nice longsleeved shirt the fabric is soft and warm you can wear it on its own or easily compliment with a jacket,1
1098,The xs was too large on me and im not a tiny person while the dress was beautiful on the model in person it had way too much fabric and fit rather tentlike the fabric is gorgeous and the dress would have worked if it were more of a fitted style and had half the amount of fabric on the bottom not flattering at all,0
1099,This is a really well made great looking blouse the details are charming i like that it is a good weight not too sheer the sleeves are perfect i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try its a keeper,1
1100,As soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath it does run large but thats my style i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties can be dressed up or down highly recommend,1
1101,This is such a lovely dress and it looks great on like other customers i like the petal hem and the top part which is stretchy is soft and not clingy i think the only drawback is that the color isnt as rich a green as it looks in the pic ive attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposesill be wearing this way into the fall,1
1102,I love this unique shirt the only thing is is is really wide like a babydoll top fit i tucked mine into skinny jeans,1
1103,I was really looking forward to this dress i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture it came wrinkled but i think even pressed it would fall weird the side swoop falls funny and you can see the seams underneath and the top front falls funny not quite sure what to do with it it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down again maybe if you get it pressed that would be better the back is still beautiful though im lbs ordered a maybe on someone talle,0
1104,Love the shirt fits great and is so cute a must have for fall,1
1105,I love this ankle length pant it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee i can wear this for seasons,1
1106,This is a beautiful highquality little black dress it actually has a little weight to it but nothing bothersome i usually take a medium across the board but i had to size up to a large this is dress has more of a straight line versus aline and i have wider hips so the large fit really good its beautiful and versatile i just wore it to my high school reunion and got compliments great purchase i would highly recommend,1
1107,I saw this dress in the store tried it on and love it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly this dress fits great and flatters my full figure size to plus it has pockets the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer from fun,1
1108,This shirt is simply pretty its light and dresses up a distressed pair of jeans,1
1109,I added this to my cart on a whim and what a nice surprise the color is gorgeousthis dark plum color is a great alternative to grey black or brown im planning to wear it first with a cream sweater a mustard colored scarf and a brown leather jacket i am a pearshape and this skirt works very well to structure and minimize my bottom half it also isnt as short as i thought it might bealthough i like the previous reviewer plan to wear this with tights and boots the only negativ,1
1110,My daughters and i all wear a size small and are heights range between and this dress was sloppy on every one of us i dont think a size x small would have made a difference the length is all over the place im not sure how or where you would fit a bra into the picture on the positive side was very soft it may work as a beach cover up,0
1111,This is the perfect simple tank for summer not clingy and hangs really nicely but not so billowy that you cant layer a nice wrap or cardigan over it fabric feels like a great quality i got it in white and its a bit sheer but i typically layer my tanks anyway tempted to get this in every color,1
1112,I bought this in both colorsfor it is perfect for meit looks great with jeans and then dress it up later with pantsthis is why i love retailer,1

1116,I love the way the neckline is open not too low it also falls on your hips just rightgreat buy,1

1118,Poor quality i expected much more from the material,0
1119,This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year it is double breasted a stretchy cotton which i love i am a big fan of cotton it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white the navy in the regular size small i am of small build at expected that the sleeves cb a little long i avoid ordering petite size jackets bc sometimes they are snug in the shoulders ok so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips but arms were bagg,1

1124,Love the high waist prewashed softness and relaxed fit i normally wear a in pilcro but sized down to a for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that wons slide down because of the high waistline i would never tuck anything in so it doesnt matter that its high waisted but i dont have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top worth every penny,1

1141,Bought as a gift really soft and cozy i am sure she will love it,1
1142,I found the fit of this dress odd i typically wear a or in dresses the fit across the chest but the armholes were large so wearing a bra would be a challenge i am a c so i need some type of support i also thought the fabric was a bit flimsy for the price i am a huge retailer fan and usually leave glowing reviews but sadly i left this one in the store,0
1143,This is an amazing dress beautiful fabric and color comfortable too its like wearing air sorta chameleon like because this print literally goes with anything and looks unforgettable on its slimming too i got the large and it flows so nicely over my body the back is completely open it closes with a tie at the neck and the waist that drapes beautifully and looks great from the side view the fabric is a bit sheer so i ordered the white cotton slip by this designer which is slightly snu,1
1144,Length too long and waist to high these are not sized for petites,0
1145,Perfect way to add warmth in transition weather,1
1146,I love these pants waited for them to go on sale and totally worth the price i wore them work and received numerous compliments great for casual friday at work or sunday brunch with the girls cant go wrong with antro,1
1147,I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress unfortunately this dress missed the mark in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white well it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink bright baby pink even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink huge disappointment my other issue is with the length of this dress the description says that the,0
1148,Wore this dress for my bridal shower and got a ton of compliments it fits great and is very well made,1
1149,I was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful bright colors tried it on and it was becoming comfortable and perfect for my laidback lifestyle i just bought it a week ago have worn it three times already i bought the blue,1
1150,Oh boyi didnt get this one and it runs small too bad,0
1151,I just received these pants and i am very pleased they are a little longer than i expected them to be but that actually works out well because now i can wear them to the office,1
1152,I was headed out of my local retailer store when i spotted this beauty i had been looking for a dresstunic like this for some time i got the lovely soft greywhite combo and it is lovely on normally an xl in tops from retailer the large in this holding horses tunic fit perfect also a note for women with bigger arms and shoulders this should work well for you as this is usually a problem for me and not the case with this piece easily dresses up or down both jeans and leggings work well,1
1153,This jumpsuit is so so comfy i cant wait to wear it def runs on the large size,1
1154,I was undecided whether to get regular or petite i am but i didnt want it to be sloppy long ordered the petite xs as other reviewers suggested ordering down and its perfect length falls on me same as the model above not heavy and very soft casual but not sloppy sleeves are a tad long which i prefer,1
1155,I tried this dress on in the store but decided to think about it because of price i ended up buying it later on line i usually wear a medium lbs wide shoulders but got a small in this dress it does run the risk of looking like a sack but sizing down did the trick the easy going loosness yet elegance is why i like it it is so comfy but looks lucious i plan to wear it often this fall and christmas,1
1156,Love love lovethis is true retailer the color is lovely and its so soft i love the seams in the back and the overall raw seam style,1
1157,Trousers fit tts with nice thick fabric and great fit the length was perfect for my height they are flattering very nice quality,1
1158,Love this top and the fit is very true to size i am and and ordered a medium the fabric weight is just right and not see through the top did not gap and the length falls just over tummy without being too tentlike too snug or too long so can be worn inside or out wish there were more color choices to order from it was touted as red motif but i would call it more redorange i cannot wear orange but it is redenough to pull off on my skin tone with the white background the sleeves,1
1159,I ordered this dress in oatmeal the minute i saw it online im and lbs and my usual xs fits perfectly i would say this dress will be the most flattering on a long lean body type it will show bumps and bulges i will wear it asap with booties and a jacket and it also looks great with flip flops or sandals for the summer very happy,1
1160,This is so comfortable i had to buy another one looks great under sleeveless sweaters interesting texture adds interest,1
1161,This dress is gorgeous it swings beautifully its soft its incredibly flattering i would say it runs big i ordered an xxs petite normally i would wear xs petite and it fits great for reference im and a dd finally a loose fitting dress that doesnt make me look pregnant,1
1162,Im and the p fit like a glove i have a bigger chest and there is no pulling on the buttons the colors and fit on the dress are perfect i had so many compliments when i wore it,1
1163,I saw this on sale and it looked lovely online i really wanted to love it when i received it it looked great but once i tried it on it bunches up in the back it looks awkward the lace and small details are pretty but the fit is just off returned it in the store,0
1164,I was a bit skeptical about this lovely sweater but now that i have tried it on with a pair of skinny jeans and tall boots i am sold it is so soft and full of movement it has a very unique design the purple color is gorgeous and inviting i will enjoy this sweater all winter long i am usually a smallmedium and the medium fits a bit big but looks beautiful on the neckline does fold in and adds to the appeal,1
1165,I fell in love with these trousers as soon as i saw them online i am a big fan of essentiel antwerp their designs are unique and bold these trousers definitely fit their aesthetic the print is darker compared to the picture making the green more of a dark olive and the blue almost looks black they have an elastic waist so that helps for some of us who have a wider bottom they cinch back in once they are buttoned at the waist so it doesnt make your hips look wide the fabric is soft and,1
1166,What a fun print to have on a dress let alone a sweet off white lace confection like this one i really love the design and all the nice high quality touches because i am busty and there is no stretch i sized up my only wish was that the look of the skirt wasnt so innocentthe flounce looks a bit juvenile especially at my age ill try to figure out how to flatten it maybe wet the skirts like a regency lady here are my stats since i purchased p dd,1
1167,I found this today on the one and only rack i absolutely fell in love with it i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly other customers were asking where they could find it in the store i highly recommend it can be dressed up or down,1
1168,Description is wrong not a swing tunic more long and straight keep that in mind when buying this if you have hips this might not be the top for you,0
1169,This sweater is just as pictured the fit is true to size though it is a looser style rather than fitted sweater it is short though not cropped and the sleeves are too long but it is still flattering it hits at the top of my hip and it looks great with highwaisted flares the scallop detail is perfect just enough interest but not overbearing the material is soft and heavier than expected it is a good weight for fall i wish it was made of natural fibers instead of synthetics but,1
1170,Love this dress i wore it with black boots and got so many compliments super comfortable i feel like this dress will never go out style,1
1171,In a sea of dresses this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store i am a pear shape and ended up trying both the medium and the large taking the medium home it was super flattering on and was an appropriate length to pair with tightsheres where the problem happened i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving i put it on and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist riiiiiiiiiip the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband so disappointed,0
1172,I bought these pants in the wine color and i love them i found them to be true to size i always wear a in pilcro and these were no exception i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am but i think i prefer this these pants can easily be dressed up or down have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats super cute,1
1173,These jeans are really soft comfortable and flattering but only after you go a size down all the other pilcro jeans ive bought have been a consistent but when i got these they were baggy i exchanged them for a and they were just the ticket,1
1174,I was waiting for this top to go on sale because its one of those tops that you can probably only find the right weather to wear it once a year so i was so happy i could order this ahead of time and pick it up in the store the same day,1
1175,This is a gorgeous top very well made with a classy design it fits true to size from the lower chest up however at about the midbelly range the shirt widens out and basically allows a month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in size xs i was so sad for the price i cant justify taking it for alterations it would have been the perfect top,0
1176,This is a beautiful color top it can be dressy or casual but the design is spectaculari paired it with one of the new retailer pencil skirts and everyone in the store looked iti wish they had other colors,1
1177,As of late its been difficult for me to find clothing at retailer that fits truetosize im and lbs and ive had to return several pieces because they were too big on me this versatile piece fits truetosize i purchased an xsp like the previous reviewer ive tried this with a couple of different longsleeve shirt and tights combinations i think this will work in the spring and fall too as the material is in between heavy and lightairy great for work,1
1178,First off these are great because they are not so tight like all other work out crops that my anatomy is not a mystery to people around me i have an athletic build and these pants are awesome in that they hug the body lightly they are so soft and comfy also perfect for running and the gym and apres whatever i bought a back up pair,1
1179,Agree with above review these are described totally wrong they are not rise they are very high rise so much that i didnt even try them onthe color isnt good either it looks like a cheap levis color or just not a quality denim if you like high rise you might like them i cant comment on fit,0
1180,Completely oversized top size medium was swimming on meboxy baggy shapeless what more can i say even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo returned,0
1181,Ive never spent this much on a pair of jeans but per another customer review that they were worth every penny i took the plunge so glad i did and also glad i sized down one size be careful when you put them on i keep putting my toe through the hole at the knee,1
1182,Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white flowing and delicate it is not seethrough so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun lovely top,1
1183,I wear this top all the time perfect with jeans and cant wait to wear with a skirt in the summeri am and have the xs which hits in a great length just as pictured i bought at full price so for the sale price you are getting a great deal,1
1184,Great buy i bought the cream jumpsuit im small on bottom and larger on top this was perfect shouldnt fit tight should flow has lots of room it is linen adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit legs are wide and flowy casual but classy both sides have about buttons at hips great addition to any closet unique in its own right,1
1185,Beautiful blend of colors and the texture of the shirt is so softperfect fall weather garment,1
1186,I didnt really understand the other reviews until i received mine in the mail i love cloth stone and this is just not up to their normal quality i bought the blue and yellow colors of this blouse its very soft but the blue already had strings coming from under the arms and i hadnt even tried them on yet material is super soft but thin cut is weird under the arms and tight sleeves are also tight i am usually an xs or s in cloth stone so i ordered smalls i just fit the arms but t,0
1187,This skirt is so soft and warm looks gorgeous with middi boots or ankle boots colors are beautiful and the length is perfect to take you into spring,1
1188,Fits great love soft material love with skinny jeans brown boots,1
1189,Works great on my frame is pretty and feminine great with skinny jeans and booties,1
1190,Love this dress it can be worn in cold or warm weather with tights and boots or sandals and bare legs the fit is roomy and a little longer in back it washes nicely without losing length,1
1191,I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large i am also pretty busty to boot but found there was more than enough room the length was still a bit long for me however it does hit on my where it does on the model the top is wonderful quality thick and not see through at all i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress,1
1192,The fabric of the pants is a great thickness so the pants have a very nice look the fabric is smooth not jean material for me this is nice because though they have weight to them the pants are not hot and can be used to dress up or down much more versatile than jeans these pants are very fitted through the hips but then fall very nicely i am not a big fan of capri length yet i really love these i have already enjoyed wearing these out and they look fabulous with any type of wedge or heel,1
1193,Love classical look and this dress may look great on not so much curvy shape price is great with extra off so considering to get dark red one as well now,1
1194,I just love this dress the color the quality the design all great sizing can be tricky however i sized down due to reading the other reviews and im glad i did it fits perfectly this dress does not have a zipper on top so if you have broad shoulders it might be a little harder to squeeze into,1
1195,I really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress instore and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online the label says machine wash it also says lay flat to dry so i was happy about that i tried this in xs regular first photo with camisole which was too lowcut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo im a aa lbs which was better higher vneck mainly and shorter length although i couldve gone with eit,1
1196,I got this in blue and also in white both size medium its a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different howeveri cant figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white but it does so consider this when you order depending upon how you want it to fit im keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way definitely not with leggings,1
1197,This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast i purchased the red and hoped that it was more of a rust colorlucked in the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layeringwhich is alway a plus i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of themin fact the stripes do the work and disguise and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker you wont be disappointed,1
1198,Loved this top online but when i tried it on it was shorter than expected so only fitting for high waisted bottoms and much more boxy than it appeared online i wish to high heaven that this top came in a more normal cut hip length and slimming the fabric and collar are beautiful,0
1199,This is a stylish blouse with classic features as well as quirky features such as pleats and gathers very flattering fit,1
1200,I am curvypetite this fits great is true to size is super comfortable and lined with cotton very pretty and well made,1
1201,Light and flows so nicely a great lengthnot to short or long great with shorts material is lovely,1
1202,Love love love this jumpsuit i cant wait to wear it in the tx summer it is super fun and elegant you can dress it up or keep it casual i am and wear a it laying quite nicely and doesnt require you to wear heels with it,1
1203,I so loved this dress online not so much in person first of all it didnt fit my build im with a f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering mainly im returning it because of the fabric the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed basically its the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful why they made i,0
1204,Saw this tunic on line and loved the color combo tried it on at the store and found it to be true to size for me im a dd ft and the regular size fit fine i was curious to see if the petite size would fit best with the loops for the tie belt being a little higher but none were available still the regular works well excited to wear when the weather gets warmer like the model with white skinny or cropped jeans and wearing it open as a duster with a tank or cami seems very ve,1
1205,I bought this for a wedding i will attend months from now when i saw this dress on sale i just need to get it it was simply gorgeous it fitted so well it makes one feel so special i like the addition of the belt,1
1206,This is a great every day dress the buttons in the back make it very figure flattering and i love the long sleeves the fabric is light so ill definitely be wearing with leggingsits a little tight in the shoulders which is pretty standard for this brand for me,1
1207,Unfortunately i will need to exchange for a bigger size i am pounds i normally wear a or a i ordered a and they are a bit too tight i am worried the will be to big but love the pants enough to give that a try excellent quality,1
1208,Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top the waist has no stretch and their isnt a zipper you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders so cute in the pic but not realistic going back,0
1209,Saw this in the store in pinkvery cool dress but i want black so im ordering it the fabric was almost lacelike it comes w a slip it was sort of swingy and designed to be aline loved it the bell sleeves totally make it,1
1210,Maybe i shouldnt have sized up to an xl but im not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit the vee is quite low and im busty itll be really low if youre smaller on top the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me not tight at all its almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view i looked like a really wide green apple i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i wouldnt recommend it,0
1211,I love this dress it is the kind of dress that i dream about the feel is young and carefree typically i love swing dresses on the tall thin models pictured but when i try them on i simply look frumpy this dress is an exception i have the lilac version and the fabric color and pattern enhance the boho pixie fairy aesthetic for reference i am lbsaverage build a little busty dd only the was in stock so that is the size i ordered even though i wanted to try the the has en,1
1212,I bought these cords in navy the color is beautiful and the fit is great it is a very slimming fit i am usually between a and i ordered the and they fit perfectly,1
1213,I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly that i dont have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up but these are perfect they are made with a bit of a stretchy material yet keep their shape well i am pounds athletic body type and got a size the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couchquiltpurseetc as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans,1
1214,This product is perfect for early fall wear when the weather is a little cooler a shell worn under it will be fabulous,1
1215,Im in love im in lovethis dress was gifted to me because i was gawking at it so often i love it i am petite pounds and i could do either the small or extra small the small was a little more comfortable because the extra small was a bit tight in the armsbut i went with the extra small anyway in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it many people even took the extra step in compl,1
1216,Great layering top so comfy feels soft as my pjs bought it in colors,1
1217,Love the gorgeous mustardgoldenrod shade but its unflattering to my skintone makes my olivetan look more sallow all the versions of the tied dresses that holding horses has come out with are fantastic in fit and flattering to the tummy if you are bustybroad backwide rib cagesize up if you have generous hipbum curves give both your regular,1
1218,This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i cant wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots its not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well love it,1
1219,Adorable soft top for the fall i wanted to love it because of the colors and the fact that it is so retro it was just way too big for me im always a medium but in this i probably should have sized down i still gave it stars because it is so cutejust didnt fit me sadly i will be returning this,1
1220,Love the color of this shirt i wear it under a brown leather jacket i purchased in store,1
1221,These jeans look amazing on hug every curve in just the right waythe long length with flareadd a platform heel and i look like i have legs for days and my booty will definitely turn some heads total splurge but for a great pair of jeans totally worth it ordered my usual size and they fit like a dream hope they dont stretch out after wearing a few hours the amount of stretch feels nice so i think theyll continue to hug your body if you want pair of flares in your wardrobe,1
1222,This looked like a simple chic blouse but the fabric felt cheap to me like thin lining fabric the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering,0
1223,I love this blouse the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time one of my favorite retailer purchases ever,1
1224,Really fun comfortable pants i havent worn them yet as its hot here but i cant wait i tried them on with wedge sandals a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says italians do it better and a jean jacketim loving the look feel of them bring on the cool autumn days,1
1225,Matronly and unflattering i think this may work on a very tall and slender body type,0
1226,This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time it runs true to size im lbs and got the xs petite wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it,1
1227,I love this top it is the cutest top ive purchased in a while the colors are so fun and the cut is flattering it will go with plenty and will work for day and night for work and on weekends you need to get this top before it sells out retailer please get this top in more patterns,1
1228,I could live in these jeans they are so comfortable they are have the perfect amount of stretch and the fabric is so soft i was skeptical because that usually means they lose their shape and im yanking on them all day however i have worn them days now and on the third day they may have stretched a little in the waist i am normally a but can get away with sometimes i chose the and felt the fit was perfect by the way im wearing the jeans with the cubanas ciara glitter boots,1
1229,I love this dress and received many compliments when i wore it the pink is beautiful however it does run large so i will need to exchange it the little square at the base of the neckline was crooked on the one i received might not bug anyone else but it bothered me,1
1230,This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things,0
1231,I sized down from a p to a p because i like a less loose fit if you want a slight baggy look then go with your usual size i love the style contrasting hem color and slight distressing look great for end of summer into fall,1
1232,I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear itbut when i washed it according to the directions on the tag it shrunk a lot the sleeves are now too tight and it is much shorter thinking about returning it to the store but in any case i cannot wear it again,0
1233,I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit feel and overall look at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits attractive sturdy and very comfortable to wear even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up weddings parties etc,1
1234,Love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric for the first few wearings i was in love then it began to pill horribly would not recommend my mother said thats going to pill up and i ignored her and she was right,0
1235,This sweaterjacket looks just like the photo in real life but the inside is so scratchy i physically recoiled when trying it on as the interior of the sleeves feels like sandpaper unlined and uncomfortable no thank youshould you choose to proceed i found the fit tts im wear an and the medium worked for me,0
1236,I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard small chest rounder in the middle and hips like whoa but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering love the quality and feel of the fabric ive worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath but then again it isnt a piece i plan to wear to work im usually a sz and got the medium regular which is perfect im and the bottom hit,1
1237,Soft comfy great fit this is the perfect cozy item for fall and winter looks really cute with the sleeves rolled or cuffed slightly the fabric is patchworked with linen and a terryjersey material im usually a medium and the medium fit great slimming lines and does a great job of being swingyflared without that tent look,1
1238,Love the fit doesnt cling to my midsection and detail on sleeves is very pretty fits true to sizei got the black but want to order it in other colors as well can be dressed up or down,1
1239,I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints the quality is excellent this top runs very large as in three sizes too large for the record i am a and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like im pregnant with twins also the layering looks nothing like it does on the model it looks sloppy unkept and a general i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist otherwise it just doesnt wor,0
1240,I havent worn these yet but i wouldnt wear them just to lounge in i wear an xs they fit good tts they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice doesnt bunch like some do the material is soft hangs nice doesnt seems like it will wrinkle love the pattern of the black print ones its black tan white kind of a paisley print i think it looks better on than in the picture,1
1241,I love wearing this pullover with leggings and boots its soft comfortable and loose fitting,1
1242,Cmon the accent is wrong a simple google search would prevent this,0
1243,I tried it on and it fit like a glove im only and i can wear with heals or flats great built in bra im a c cup and ive got a bubble butt very flattering on my figure quality worth every penny many compliments work appropriate or a luncheon my fav retailer purchase by far,1
1244,Cup size is really small for a medium no way to adjust the back strap ended up giving it to my daughter cute but so poorly executed,0
1245,I ordered top and pants online as seen pants are of good quality and hang beautiful i love the color and quality of the fabric nice and vibrant nice fit at the top into a flowy drape the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size love the outfit for my upcoming island trip,1
1246,Gorgeous color flowy fabric unique design this top is a winner i dont even mind that ill have to wear a strapless bra with it a little bit on the larger size but not too big in my opinion,1
1247,I waited six weeks for this dress to arrive and was so disappointed loved the skirt part of it but the top which i guess i didnt see in photo was pleated as well made my bust look huge and it puffed out on sides would have been a wonderful summer dress flowing and cool,0
1248,I was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck that being said i was so disappointed in the fit i ordered a size and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides made no sense hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit order up for length down for arm length,0
1249,I seriously love this skirt i bought it for my college graduation and i was complimented by everyone that saw it not only that but it is beyond versatile you can dress it up make it casual or make it professional it is extremely ideal especially for the price it also is the most comfortable skirt ive ever worn so thats a plus,1
1250,Dolan is my go to for comfy pretty practical dresses im lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand i bought the taupe not my favorite color but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry summer must have,1
1251,Holy cow i just got a new bathing suit so i cannot splurge again but this is flattering i like the more tame colors which doesnt scream look at me lets be honest there are certain times of the month where wed rather crawl in a ball and hide the design along the sides is absolutely flattering and slimming on anyone i also like the skintonecoral detailing around the top of the breast that extends all the way around the back retailer is really winning with their swimwear thi,1
1252,This is about the cutest thing sincewell i dont know but its pretty cute yes i agree with the other reviewer who said it looked better in hand than on the web has cute soft ruffle just above hip and the stripes are soft pastels the buttons at the nape of the neck are sweet theres the wordsweetthats the perfect descriptive for this quirky laid back feminine piece ttsnothing weird or uncomfortable about the fit but it does seem a bit shorter than the picture shows i am lbs,1
1253,Cute kitty sweater im feet and went with a regular size xs instead of petite and it hits perfectly yes its itchy it wool but i plan on wearing mine with a highlow tee under it so cute,1
1254,Like the other reviewer said the print is more beautiful in person i am usually a small in meadow rue and this fits well in a small my only issue is that the lining hangs out from the bottom and hangs out unevenly hopefully i can exchange it or get it sewed up evenly,1
1255,Lovely blouse very well made i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing right now somewhere between a d and c the medium was a little roomy for i couldve easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size quality fabric very comfortable yet dressy id definitely recommend this blouse,1
1256,This dress fits and hangs so nicely it is so versatile as well dress it up or down,1
1257,I typically wear xs or s or zeros but i got this in a m it doesnt look big it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small its soft beautiful and warm the hood is so cute the detail is just so good i love it over top of long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs,1
1258,This dress didnt do much for me on the hanger but it was on sale and thought i would try it on in the store so glad i did definitely cuter on than just hanging there the back has a belt feature that adds a little structure the colors are nice and bright will be good for our hot austin summers,1
1259,Grabbed this tank on sale today in the green color great tank it is not thin like some other retailer tops it actually is a double knit fabric which hides those imperfections we dont want anyone to see or worry about the top runs a bit on the full side so if you are in between sizes i would go down one this top is great to wear under any open sweater for the entire fall season the green color is a jewel green so the top does not look summary at allit is extremely comfortable a,1
1260,Bought this back during an retailer event because i was in the market something long oversized to wear over leggings so when i saw this i thought it could fit the bill i read the reviews knew it was more of a soft tshirtlike fabric and is short when belted so because im i was soldi bought the xl because i have wide shoulders a dd chest size when i got it home i was in love rich garnet so soft comfy then i tried buttoning it it was just a bit too small pul,1
1261,The blouse is lightweight and is double layered meaning a light layer over a lower layer its not bulky and not super flowyjust enough im a bit busty and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great its figure flattering and not boxy may be a tad short for taller women,1
1262,I ordered a size and it was huge on me very loose fitting dress i didnt like the material either,0
1263,I bought two of these in xs i am and lbs i started with the size small but that was to big so down to a size xs and that was perfect the color ivorywhite is really nice is not see through i wear nude bras and it goes with everything i also didnt see any loose strings falling out of it like another reviewer saidquality material the burnt orange is really nice too perfect for fall love the pockets just make sure you size down one or two i am usually a size medium to a lar,1
1264,I really loved this skirt on the model i ordered it in my typical and it fit well the green was adorable and the buttons are rose gold which is quite pretty i did exchange this skirt for a only because the was just too short for me if the is a bit longer but not terribly huge in the waist i will probably keep it i was surprised by how large the a line felt but i think i can get used to it it really is very fun and very easy to dress up or down im really hoping the bigger si,1
1265,This is one of my favoriteit is timeless for sure,1
1266,I bought this top on a whim its not my style but wanted to try something different the fabric and print are amazing so unique soft subtle and delicate great fit as well my only complaint is not the fault of the top but if you have a bit of tummy the fold at the peplum really brings it out so youd have to wear highwaisted bottoms or suck it in the hem is also really flowy more so than shown in the pictures theres a lot of fabric so it kind of ruffles more at the bottom rath,1
1267,This actually might be my favorite thing that i have ever owned the jacket is so beautiful and so cozy jacket i agree that the pics do not do this amazing piece justice for reference i am lbs and bought the large to allow a bit of room for layering,1
1268,This tank fit perfectly and goes with everything will be purchasing in more colors,1
1269,Love everything about this top the ruffles give the top a great edgy style will look great with some skinny jeans and boots,1
1270,I bought a similar shirt from this same manufacturer in blue and ive returned for another i love it because you can layer it you can wear this over a colored shirt and the color will show through the designs in the yoke it looks great with bright colors yes it wrinkles easily but i am hoping that it will wrinkle less each time it is washed,1
1271,This swimsuit is super cute and retro the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass sinspired look great for us ladies without a lot up top i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit i love the back coverage too your butt doesnt hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdyi was worried about sizing when i first ordered it based on what everyone said i went with a,1
1272,These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up love the pom poms,1
1273,Comfortable but if you put in the dryer even on low it will shrink a little so beware,1
1274,So im not sure if its just my body type or what but this did nothing for me the bottom which i thought would be too big was actually too small in both the small and the medium im a size bottom and then when i sized up to the medium it was still too tight and then the top was loose i just think this one is going to take the right body type it could look really beautiful on the right person just not me,0
1275,This is my new favorite white top in my closet the loose fit flowy quality fabric and effortless versatility are spot on for anyones wardrobe i took my usual size s i wouldnt size down in this because although its roomy in the torso the sleeves and shoulders fit perfectly on my thin arms everyone should have this beauty,1
1276,I am about athletic build i purchased this dress for business meetings and such i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it luckily this is the case here too the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love nice fabric good quality happy i bought it,1
1277,This is a beautiful piece but not if you need a hardy sweater the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw but it is lightweight and delicate i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness i had to say no i will watch for sale,1
1278,I ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy the navy blue underlayer is so flattering and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely the shape and pattern are forgiving this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue if youre between sizes especially armwise id order up otherwise just get your regular size the body is flo,1
1279,I splurged on this top and was sadly disappointed im a d and the l was so tight i couldnt get it over my chest also the arms were super tight and the length is nearly cropped and the fabric is shiny the picture makes it look like its matte if it did fit like the model i wouldve loved it the print is beautiful though bummer,0
1280,This top is absolutely adorable i cannot express how much i love it paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring this can easily transition into summer its actually cuter irl than in the picture if you are on the fence about this get it you wont regret it,1
1281,I was really excited about this sweater but the fit was terrible the sleeves were the right size but the body of the sweater was a tent absolutely no shape they must have clipped the sweater on the model for reference im and pounds and ordered a size small,0
1282,I ordered this shirt online and just received it in the mail the floral design is nice but the mesh fabric in the back is low quality and cheapens the look of the shirt especially considering the price most disappointingly the neck hole is almost as small as the arm holes with no zipper or button opening i could not fit my head through the opening and thus could not even put the shirt on needless to say i will be returning it i ordered the xs so it is possible that larger sizes do n,0
1283,Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like im pregnant not that theres anything wrong with that very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf,1
1284,The jeans are even better in person great fit and the color is nice my new fave,1
1285,Yes may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt but this is one is worth it i can wear this with everything i bought this in grey and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day one of the best retailer purchases ive made in a while,1
1286,I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xss although its wool i didnt notice that is was itchy usually wool bothers me i am of small build but i did like the long oversized look i admit i am drawn to the print anyways i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xss it was the same probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xss in a few wks since the invent,1
1287,Received this dress for christmas and fell in love the detail and fit is perfection the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow its very flattering overall a great little dress,1
1288,I bought this top in taupe and love the style its not too boxy or long cotton is always a plus and i just wish there were more colors,1
1289,Love this dress perfect for spring and fall great material and well made lovey design the dress has a built in slip,1
1290,Soft and flowy fit is great quality is great i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well i havent worn a dress in years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first highly recommendi paired this with short black suede boots and black tights many compliments even from my husband and he doesnt usually pay much attention,1
1291,Ive been looking for a cozy sweater dress for a while because everything always seems to be so form fitting im between an xs and a small and i got the small for this and its just a little roomy so its perfect fabric is pretty thin so it drapes well and it wont be too warm,1
1292,Bought this based off the reviews here but this was a miss for me the colors werent as vibrant as pictured and the waist in this dress is huge not flattering and it went back i buy an retailer dress every week so i just exchanged this one for another one i loved not hard to do at all,0
1293,This is a beautiful top but it runs largei am exchanging for one size smallerit is worth the effort of exchangingwell made beautiful lace,1
1294,Perhaps i have gotten too used to flowy shirts or the cut of this was not right for me but it felt too fitted around the rear end and the shoulders didnt lay right on me sizing up would have only made it too big in the shoulders so i returned i am lbs c curvymuscular frame and ordered a size small,0
1295,The quality of the garment is higha nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern but the cut was totally off for me im usually an xss and was swimming in the xs the arms in particular were huge and drapey and the whole thing just hung on me for reference im lbs,0
1296,I am pounds i purchased this in a size small it is flowy and not too short it has a comfortable but still feminine and beautiful fit one of my favorite new blousesthe red print is gorgeous,1
1297,This jacket is really cute i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried its perfect very fitted and cropped but will look great to throw on over a dress for reference im foot inches and a c lbs slender but athletic medium was perfect,1
1298,I think this blouse looks better in real life than it does on line and im glad i decided to try it on i bought an extra small in the red which i think is the best color the white looks like a nightgown too bad there were not more darker fall prints because i would have bought more than one i think this style would look best on someone that is tall and thin a petite person might get away with turning it into a dress i would buy a longer version of this as it is it is a fun feminine casu,1
1299,I first saw this vest displayed in the window and admired the colors and weave i couldnt get it out of my mind so i had to make a special trip back to retailer to buy it it is soft and drapes well looks amazing with denim and boots i think it will be my favorite fall purchase,1
1300,Love this tank i am petite and this was the perfect length for me i wore it with white jeans and a blazer love the print,1
1301,Oh this skirt is gorgeous but i feel it runs small in the waistim sending it back and ordered up im happy i did as today its sold outbeautiful and vibrant colors very well made just wish some of the retailer sizes wouldnt run on the smaller side,1
1302,This sweater is adorable i got it in the grey pattern its got a great forgiving fit lots of stretch with a hilow waist in a thick soft knit and quarter sleeves the contrasting collar and cuffs add interest its great with jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks i cant wait for the weather to cool down so i can wear it i might get it in more colors too its a great basic,1
1303,This is such a great piece throw this top on with a pair of skinnies and some booties and youre dressed it walks the line between too tight and too loose beautifully for my figure love the contrast lining it washes beautifully i hang to dry i wore it twice the first week i owned it size s was best for me im lb b and generally a size,1
1304,This is a great easytowear dress with lovely beaded detailing all over the front bodice and ladder lace trim running the length of the sleeves easily dressed up or down i usually wear petites but ordered the regular size based on previous reviews and the slightly longer length was perfect for me it hit just above the knees there were a few beads that were coming a little loose so i did have to secure those but it wasnt a big deal for me as im pretty comfortable with light mending et,1
1305,Im not much of a chino girl but these fit like a favorite pair of jeans and with heels still look really polished love them,1
1306,Nice work top i ordered the slightly yellow ivory print which is beautiful and the print placement perfect even better its work appropriate the cottonsynthetic blend has stretch without stretching outsize i ordered my normal size small for retailer brands like meadow rue im approx lbs d narrow shoulders short arms long torsofit the sleeves are slightly long but the buttoned cuffs rest at my wrist the fabric blend allows this top very good drape i like,1
1307,As someone with a large chest and a smaller waist i found this top incredibly unflattering and i like swingy tops it was too short too wide in the hips and too tight in the bust the pattern and fabric are very pretty though,0
1308,Many internet reviews note that byron lars dresses run large and suggest that women and under should size down and go petite i am and pounds and the petite size was too snug across my back and too short when i sat down when i stood up i had to pull the dress down as it would bunch up around the hips therefore the size regular ended up being a perfect fit no alterations needed i was searching for a dress for an upcoming wedding and for vacation and kept coming back to thi,1
1309,Love another pair of ag stevies,1
1310,Quality of this dress is excellent i ordered it in blue and the color looks exactly as it does online and the fit is exactly as it looks on the model i am lbs with an athletic build and ordered a small,1
1311,I received this tank today and i fell in love with it immediately i am petite b lbs and purchased this in the only size left which was a small yesit is very billowy but i do a half tuck into my pants and that solves the problem perfectly and looks great i have very well toned arms and the way this is cut just accentuatea this yay the fabric is soft and the overall look is super feminine so very happy with my purchase plan on wearing with jeans shortscropped jeans,1
1312,I wore this dress for my small winter wedding and it was perfect i thought it ran a little large though because i had to return it times to get the right size once i got the right size it fit perfectly i loved the champagne color and shine,1
1313,I was sooo excited to buy this top and it was such a bummer this top hangs so poorly and is so droopy under the arms its clearly poorly made and the sizing was way off on me i ordered my usual medium and it was so large and wide that i had to return it it weirdly fit perfectly in the shoulders and arm length as mediums do for me but was so wide and unflattering for my figure and athletic i really wanted to like this top and considered ordering a small to see if it would fit better bu,0
1314,These jeans are fantastic ive worn them once and got many compliments definitely keepers i am and weigh about normally i wear a but i sized down based on reviews to a they fit perfectly at the start of the day but as all jeans with a bit of stretch do they get bigger as the day goes on but because theyre a boyfriend cut it all works really happy with this purchase my only regret is that i didnt get two pair,1
1315,This is figure featuring without being too tight it fits exactly like the picture it is a bit pricey but can be dressed up or dressed down and is perfect for hot summer days as well as worn with a cardigan i love it,1
1316,Love this jacket it is soooo soft and goes with everything you will want to wear it every day loved it so much i bought my mother one too,1
1317,I wanted to love this top but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the grey that you order is much much lighter grey in addition this shirt is super boxy thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in going back disappointed,0
1318,Love this hoodie so soft and goes with everything highly recommend for comfort and style great company,1
1319,I ordered this top in rose the color is actually more of a cream with navy and yellow stripes but i could tell that from the photo when i was ordering the fit is true to size and the cut is very flattering excited to add this gem to my summer wardrobe,1
1320,The beaded shoulders make this a unique tee shirt it turns an ordinary tee shirt into a more eyecatching one i bought different colors and love them i prefer the little boxier fit as it is very flattering the material is a nice weight not too thin,1
1321,I absolutely fell in love with this dress in the store and immediately scooped it up in black wore it times on hot summer days and it was perfect very comfortable easy to throw on and dress up or down i decided to hand wash instead of dry cleaning as i usually do and after hanging dry it became significantly more translucent than it had been before i can no longer wear this dress because you can see everything through it its as though the fabric completely changed after being wet,0
1322,I bought this dress on a whim i am so glad i did got it in black it is stunning and comfortable,1
1323,I wanted to buy my usual mp but was sold out and so was normal m i got the regular l and it fits like a shift dress and does not enhance my curves it looks like a luxurious knitted sack but i mean that in a good way it is very comfortable does not cling and reaches just below my knees i do worry about the stretch factor as other reviewers have noted but since i just received it we will see i do not like the sheer sleeves i wish i could take them off i do not like the button loop at the,1
1324,Absolutely love this dress maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses the dress is soft and flowing the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you i recommend trying on a dress by this maker their cuts are consistent so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online this is a keeper and can be worn year round,1
1325,Im not typically a fan of pilcro pants compared to paige or other brands like j brand however these simple black skinny jeans were just what i was looking for they hit perfectly at the ankle and look great with a bootie they are quite stretchy and i like my black jeans truly like a legging so i sized down sizes im typically between a and and i purchased a in these initially they were snug around the waist but eased with wear the material is flexible yet sturdy,1
1326,Love this coat super soft and cozy did not realize the sleeves are built in to the jacket wasnt too excited at first but once i tried it on i fell in love great quality,1
1327,This product is awesome im a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me they are tight enough that they dont wind up sliding down around my ankles but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends,1
1328,This is a great top easy breezy and perfect for fall in miami perfect top for spring too love the whimsical pattern a great addition to any wardrobe,1
1329,Really cute skirt love that it has hidden pockets in the front ended up just being a bit too wide on me cant size down as fits everywhere else will look great on someone just not me order true to size fits great,1
1330,I purchased this dress for myself however when i tried it on at home the length was too short i gave the dress to a relative who is petite and the dress fit her perfectly,1
1331,Beautiful emerald green color in a lovely silk i suggest one size down if youre small chested as the arm holes will fit more snugly,1
1332,I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav transform any outfit it has an oversized fit,1
1333,This is a beautiful and comfortable top the brocade front panel is a nice take on a traditional pattern but in bright colors with a metallic sheen the knit sleeves and back are a stretchy nubby complement overall a great piece and perfect for the holidays,1
1334,I actually love these jeans i feel they run true to size i actually love the button detailing at the bottom makes them unique and different from the other jeans in my closet i can wear them dressed up with heels or wear with sandals,1
1335,This is a great fall shirt great for dressing up casual wear,1
1336,Love love love its the perfect cozy comfy piece for a bitterly cold day and the color is such a nice shade for the dreary winter,1
1337,I was so excited when these pants went on sale tried them on instore and ordered online tried both medium and small and they both work thanks to the elastic waistline they do run very long so if youre super tall these are great otherwise prepare to wear very tall heels or get them hemmed,1
1338,I ordered this after falling in love with the nearidenticallypatterned red linen shirtdress this dress has almost exactly the same construction but the cloth is slightly heavierweight and there is no slip because the fabric is thick enough to not need one a few other reviewers mentioned that the cut was illfitting or unflattering obviously that depends on the wearers build this dress seems cut for relatively smallbusted people so i lucked out i love the classic aframe outlin,1
1339,I received this coat as a th birthday present from my mother and i have to say this is the best present she has ever bought me the inside of the jacket is the softest sheerling ive felt and is pure bliss to wear around town the coat is actually a lot warmer then i expected which im not going to complain about the print is lovely and i appreciate the faux leather edge on the cuffs giving it a more finished look the fit is fantastic im a bit curvy and the cinched waist with the belt g,1
1340,I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me i wasnt expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer d and it fits perfectly the material is a touch thin but thats okay with me since i dont want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway i also dont find this top particularly see through as its black and will wear a full coverage bra wit,1
1341,This shirt is really lovely the fabric is soft and comfortable and the embroidery is very well done it looks great with jeans and adds a little feminine touch to the look,1
1342,I bought the blue white one and it is so very comfortable it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings great quality at a good price,1
1343,I am somewhat of a perennial saleonly retailer purchaser often even when a promo code i dont buy full price lol when i saw this top i decided it was worth it i got the penguin print my yearold squealed when she saw me pull it out of the box thanks retailer for your woodlandinspired prints that enamor my little onemaeve tends to run big so i went with the in my opinion it fits true to size i probably would have liked it just a little bigger maybe the would have been bes,1
1344,Not only a beautiful knit but can be worn as both tunic and dress on my short frame it does not look like a sack tent when worn very soft and flattering collar is styled well and can be shaped different ways pattern and color combo is the similar to the exquisite eira dress i am and i chose the regular over petite i only wish the sleeves were longer,1
1345,I bought this dress for an october wedding in savannah ga i love it can be dressed up or down im and lbs and bought an xs like other reviewers said its a little tight through the arms i probably could have done an xxs but wouldnt be as comfortable id recommend this dress to anyone looking for a versatile dress for fall and winter,1
1346,I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that ive received this dress im appalled by all the positive reviews this dress is hideous in person seriously hideous and even if you can get past the drapery fabric its incredibly restricting the picture online is so misleading the dress isnt even an ivory its more of a pea green so disappointed,0
1347,Stunning very well made the colors are so vibrant and stand out without being too flashy the cut is a bit strange but it works runs true to size i took my normal size i rarely buy anything at retailer full price but i made an exception with this one a must buy,1
1348,This dress is amazing quality with stunning details its flowy and absolutely beautifuli plan on wearing it whilst im in the depths of the mongolian mountains while singing operatic ariasi ordered a size two regular even though i am petite for the sole purpose of dress lengthin the picture the dress comes down to an awkward length on the model the sleeves are and it doesnt look as good as it could if the length settled down to where their ankles are or if the sleeves reache,1
1349,So ordered online tried this on boyfriend asked me if i was buying maternity clothes back it goes super cute but huge,0
1350,With a skirt so vibrant its hard not to feel happy wearing it i tried this on in store following a spring fashion show while i usually need petite sizes for lengthproportion purposes im slender build the regular size was a great fit and length any shorter and it may have taken a bit of the elegance away from the skirt and i dont necessarily mind a shorter length but this was beautiful as it was the price is a bit steep but the quality of the material justifies it the one,1
1351,I had high hopes with the other positive reviews but it didnt work on me nice stretchy fabric and nice length but it was bunchy in the front and didnt lay well and didnt do my bust any favors maybe better on those less pear shaped hopeless on me,0
1352,I love this top tassels are not too big material is thick i wish is was a little longer though,1
1353,Im an xl in retailer tops and to be frank sometimes some of the xl are too fitted and i return them i bought this blouse in size large and it fits loose everywhere it drapes very nicely in the front and back and the arms fit loose im making a point to say this to let people know to size down i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model but for me it hits at a nice length i have a short waist and am busty the lace doesnt hit my neck,1
1354,This top is lovely its got a decent length to it so it can be tucked into nice pants or a skirt the gold beading design on the shoulders is a little heavy which can sometimes cause it to slipsag off the shoulder not entirely off but enough to reveal a bra strap for a kind of offshoulder look its very flattering if you tuck it in or even if you dont i got this top in red and its lovely a little more towards than coral side than crimson,1
1355,Super cute dress but the waist band is very large and bulky,0
1356,I really liked the style of this dress the top was nice and stretchy and the bottom is so soft and silky i love lace and thought that was a nice detail for the top the colors are a little brighter in person the red in the pictures here is more of a hot pink in person im planning on buying some hot pink flats to wear with it at a wedding this summer one reviewer said she didnt like the placement where the dress fell i have a short torso and long legs so i like to try to emphasize a,1
1357,Really nice green blend of colors fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket is a bit itchy need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath,1
1358,Very comfortable and love the color im a bit curvier on the bottom and the small still fit me fine,1
1359,After a rough day at the office i went into my local retailer to seek out some retail therapy i stumbled upon this skirt and knew i had to try it on though its more than i normally like to spend it was well worth the price material is lightweight and comfortable yet substantial enough for work fit is spot on i have wider hips and a smaller waist which typically makes me a size and thats what i bought the color is a gorgeous mustard yellow that can be paired with all sorts of colors,1
1360,I am and weigh around and the medium fit me perfectly hit me just below the knee cap its cottonlinen but not as prone to wrinkles as i thought it would be its double lined made from a quality fabric thicker but still very much breathable will see how this holds up in kansas citys degree summers but so far mids its been just fine id definitely recommend this skirt the only thing that this skirt is missing is pockets,1
1361,This dress is beautiful and extremely flattering i have an hourglass shape and this dress highlighted that perfectly the pictures online do not do it justice,1
1362,I love this sweater jacket found it on the sale rack in a medium and fits like a medium would fit from my adored retailer i am inches and dd chest and curvy lbs the knitted detailed collar is a show stopper and what makes this item look like an an old school retailer item the color is really not orange but more of a vintage rose with hints of rust and soft shades of pink i love this color and i think it would look beautiful on many skin tones i paired it with a pink blouse from anth,1
1363,Good quality shirt cute design and not sheer not quite as loose and stretchy as most of retailers shirt but good fit,1
1364,This dress is more beautiful in person loved it fits true to size i had to return it because it was to long for what i needed,1
1365,This tank is an easy piece to add into your summer wardrobe and its amazingly affordable i dont think the material is too think like the previous reviewer i chose the petite size and it sits well at the chest and is a great length not too long but still able to front tuck i bought two colors and am interested in all the rest,1
1366,I love the ethnic colors the creative woven design of this garment thats what attracted me in the first place however some of the metallic threads had snagged i thought the loose weave acrylic yarns would lead to more snags it would eventually stretch out of shape also its very big too bad it doesnt come smaller in the online picture it must have been gathered clipped behind the model because it really doesnt fit close like that the long armholes are not visible online as,0
1367,This is instantly one of my favorite dresses but please note it runs large size down i am and regularly a size i tried both of those sizes on in store and picked the it was perfectly form fitted and the perfect length when i got home i realized i had been reading the uk sizes on the tag and really bought a size no idea how it fit me i have never purchased a size in my life i am adding a photo so potential customers can see what it looks like on an average sized person,1
1368,I love this gown so much i would wear it everyday if i could it is cozy beautiful and feels special like an heirloom the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft color is much prettier than the photo picks up i love this gown my favorite hands down,1
1369,Love the colors and top part but it runs extremely large and there is way too much fabric it is almost like a moo moo had to return,1
1370,I own several of these tops and i love them i am lbs and i wear a small i bought the gray and white stripe and the ivory and black stripe and they are very flattering the front hits me at the same place as it does on the model and the back covers my butt i own several of the solid colors in this style as well and they are just as great this shirt is so soft and comfortable you wont regret buying it,1
1371,I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it,1
1372,This tunic is very pretty in black it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely im so i ordered the petite but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings with jeans the petite length will work well i recommend using the size chart provided i general wear an xs but ordered the s based on the size chart its a perfect fit,1
1373,This top is such a great investment piece looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time it is pricey but you will not regret buying this goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time,1
1374,I love this unique tshirt the fall colors and ranchers theme are perfect with skinny jeans and boots a western look thats feminine the shirt is very soft ordered my usual size small a little long but good for tucking in,1
1375,Green feminine and flattering love this dress,1
1376,I ordered a size in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great i am lbs with bust the sleeves are the perfect length i couldnt be happier with this purchase,1
1377,I am i bought the charcoal gray in a large and i love it fabric is super soft hangs beautifully no weird spreading across the chest like the previous reviewer i have long arms and the sleeves are long and hit me mid palm just like the model in the photo i have worn the sleeves rolled up and down and it works recommend this for a casual comfy top with interesting design,1
1378,For me this top ran true to size im so glad i ordered it in my normal size because the spandex would have made the top way too clingy for me i am normally a medium on top and bottom i ordered this in a medium and do not find it large at all if you are going for a fitted look sizing down may be best but i didnt want it tight on me its a little looser than what is shown on the model but it still fits very nice and not sloppy i am not a fan of baggy tops i have no issues with,1
1379,Gorgeous dress ordered the orange in an xs im usually a small in retailer but the reviews accurately assessed this dress to run large im about lbs and this dress is just above my knee very flattering and feminine only issue is that the bottom is a thin material that can be see through in the right light,1
1380,I felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes i am long lean and broad shouldered i normally wear a m but ordered a l it still fits snug so ive exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape as pictured on the model material and color of the red motif is darling light as a feather will take me spring through summer,1
1381,I saw this dress several times and never try it then i finally put it on omg i love it it does run large i am usually medium but the small size is perfect on me i visually like the blue color but the orange one is cuter on me the length is great i am its right to my lower ankle so i dont need to wear heel the quality is very good its a great weekend dress,1
1382,Is not a place i want to be even if the style of a sweater is great yes this sweater is very cropped but i think itamps definitely intended to be worn off the shoulder to drop the waist a bit itamps the itchiness that makes it an immediate ampquotnoampquot and thatamps coming from someone who has serious fiber itch tolerance,0
1383,I agree with the previous reviewer that this shirt is way to sheer at least for me if you dont mind wearing a cami under it or your bra and skin showing in the back especially then it might be for you i did not feel like it was very good quality either the print is really cute but then it did not button all the way up and i like the option because i think they drape better when they have buttons to the top wether you choose to button up,0
1384,Just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much ive had the black and white for about years now and they are still intact only the buttons fall off once in a while but thats when im being aggressive and on the go buttoning the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection,1
1385,This dress had so much potential looked cute when i received it put it on couldnt wait to take it off its shapeless top heavy just overall unflattering the material could be cuteon a totally different dress dont waste your money,0
1386,The colors are vibrant and the beading is beautifully simple and nicely done i waited quite a few months for this dress but it was worth the wait its loose fitting but still gives you some shape without looking like you are wearing a potato sack,1
1387,This top looked so cute on i loved the color and the way it looked on my body as cute as this looked tied it could also be worn open as well with a tank top loved it,1
1388,The shirt is cute but there is no way that the length posted on the website is correctits a crop top this was returned,0
1389,Flattering fit and neckline too thin to wear without a cami or tank underneath for me but i was expecting that great goto tee,1
1390,Comfortable the color was great just as it looks in the picture nice design,1
1391,The floral print and colors are so pretty for summer that its tempting to layer this over a seamless tank and wear it out,1
1392,Absolute best pair of yoga pants they are the softest material so comfy im lbs with a curvy figure and the m fit perfectly,1
1393,I disagree with the other reviewsthe colors on this dress are great bright against the black and the studs are super cute and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch fun dress i think its as fitted or not as you want drives me crazy when people get hung up on their size to judge clothes go up or down if it doesnt fit the way you want i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly,1
1394,Adorable denim dress fabric is lighter than i imagined but is very flattering perfect length this is not a form fitting dress at all so if youre going for that pass on the dress or possibly order a size down,1
1395,Love this tee purchased the blue and white i usually wear xs in many retailer items but opted for a medium in this tee so it would fit loose works good not fitting too tight i like it because its a tee shirt but its a little dressy great for going out to dinner etc,1
1396,This is one of my favorite sweaters of the season it is warm and cozy and looks so cute with jeans its definitely a little shorter on me than it looks on the model even though im only,1
1397,I bought this in the dark gray and its got a lot of blue undertones to it its beautiful and flattering in my regular size not too fitted not as loose as on the model but still roomy enough ill take the advice of a previous reviewer and wash only the armpits when needed this fabric is so delicate im afraid it will shrink if i ever submerge the whole thing in water its a gorgeous piece and im happy to have it for the remaining cool days of the season,1
1398,I bought this online days before my trip to seattle i read the reviews so was aware it runs largeand it does i practically lived in it the whole time i was there its very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal ill be back in it some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but didnt like the ties hanging loose i just looped each one and it works great it really runs large i bought their smallest size and had ample room,1
1399,I love these pants and wear them all the time i wish they hadnt been discontinued,1
1400,I love love love this skirt very flattering i am with a waist and ordered a size based on previous reviews yes it is snug through the hips i think it will stretch a bit with wear however i imagine curvy ladies may want to size up sadly i was not blessed with much in the way of curves the material is thick the skirt is lined the print is beautiful this is one skirt i was happy to pay full price for rather than risk missing it,1
1401,Runs a little big but cute and comfortable also shows bra straps a bit on each side even when i ordered a size smaller overall very happy with it,1
1402,This coverup is perfect for the beach or the pool it is see through,1
1403,Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding unfortunately the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else it fit well but was poorly made based off other reviews this isnt the first time this has happened with this dress not worth the risk at all,0
1404,Not your classic sweatshirt can be worn with black grey mauve,1
1405,This is an amazing sweater thick but not overly thick the material is beautiful and the colors rich i love the collar and the way it closes as well as the pockets and the back being different from the front i hope it washes well i bought the moss it fits nicely and is very slimming i highly recommend,1
1406,Lovely holiday blouse flows at the bottom but doesnt bell out like some tunic blouses the arms arent cut in to much and i found that flattering to my shoulders the velvet and trim is strong and solid while the bottom half has a sweet little polka dot finish charming and romantic,1
1407,I didnt pay much attn to this online im not much on front hook tie closures well saw today at the local store decided to try on both the s m i am usually a s in tops but the m was only a bit more roomy longer than the s so i went with the size m i thought the styling of it paired well w the pilcro cord skinnys i had on looked much better than the pics online i have other pilcro skinny cords jeans in vs colors so i think this top will work out well for me love the sleev,1
1408,Soooo disappointed in this dress the colors are beautiful for fall the fabric feels luxe the slip fits perfectly the dress however is a hot mess it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flowy aline dress huge everywhere under the arms and waist and hips its just an enormous tent i am lbs i ordered my usual size small i looked shapeless in this i cant think of any body type it would flatter potentially women quite far along in their pregnancy,0
1409,My new favorite sweater for layering perfect color length and fit i am and purchased my usual small if youre on the fence about this one i say try it on its totally worth it,1
1410,I want to address that with lightweight but not too skimpy for the summertime and the stress works perfectly i got the red in a small and although one reviewer said that she did not like that the top and bottom are two different materials i actually think its super cute not sure if i would pay the full price but the off sale made it worth it,1
1411,Im normally an xs and i bought size and it fit great very slimming and looks great with white capris,1
1412,I honestly just love the hanky panky brand i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie but the quality fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it this piece is no exception i dont normally purchase lingerie like this but saw this chemise and decided to try it just as the other pieces from this brand its comfortable and gorgeous so high quality and classy its a great cut the fabric is clearly lace but beautifully done and the feel is lov,1
1413,Too big and its not secure enough to wear for swimming,0
1414,The pants are pretty and run true to size but the fabric is bathing suit like very thin and sheers in the butt when you squat i wouldnt recommend for anything but waking,0
1415,This dress the picture doesnt do the dress justice its so beautiful well made and unique lots of beading and detailing for the price im super happy with my purchase,1
1416,I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy this dress had a lot of potential i was drawn to the print but the material is awful so thin and scratchy immediately went back,0
1417,My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them baggy in the behind and sloppy looking they are going back asap,0
1418,I picked this maxi up in navy to go with my summertime capsule wardrobe that i will be doing extensive travel with this summer this dress is well made and fits my frame in a size m perfectly lbs c it is substantial enough to disguise any backside indiscretions and the halter style front does not expose the girls i do wear petals with this dress to ensure that i dont put on a show especially in air conditioned rooms this launders easily and doesnt look rumpled and wilted after,1
1419,This is such an amazing take on a white blouse its fun and still polished the fabric is so soft and so easy to dress up or downthe arm holes run a little small but the cut of everything else is amazing,1
1420,Love the way these pants fit love the length love the cut just the right amount of flare normally i am a or in citizens jeans i considered the in them but the legs were a bit tight was just about perfect and the best partthey are finally on sale i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt,1
1421,I love the fit and the color i would buy this tshirt again in other patterns and colors the fabric is thin and lightweight but i knew that when i bought it apparently nothing this is a problem for some others i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it to preserve the fabric i hang dry after laundering the colors have not faded and the fabric is holding up well i am weigh lbs and do typically wear size medium,1
1422,I love the design of this top short and swingy with a cute mock turtleneck and interesting textured pattern definitely runs large if youre between sizes definitely go for the smaller one it also has pretty large armholes so you can kind of see your bra from the side,1
1423,This arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online im a curvy gal so i honestly wasnt feeling like this would look good on me but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to itlike it would be rainproof the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion even cuter than the blue side the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj,1
1424,I own a couple of bailey dresses and am a huge fan of their comfort and ability to flatter my figure when i saw this one on a special promo i knew i had to try it on once i did i knew it had to come home with me i wore it to a work event last night and look forward to wearing it on a date night soon i am a s or m and took a s in this dress i went with cobalt and paired it with gold jewelry as in the photo,1
1425,Love this fits great warm and soft would recommend,1
1426,I purchased this dress for a summer celebration i am petite but ordered the dress in a misses size one size smaller because i wanted it to hit right at the knee rather than the shorter abovetheknee length pictured i loved all about the dress the fact that the colors are more vibrant than in the picture and that is has a beige slip i dressed it up with gold chandelier earrings and nude sandals and got compliments form almost everyone i am planning to dress it down with espadrilles,1
1427,I bought this outfit online on sale so i only paid but i think if i saw it in person first i probably wouldnt have purchased it while the design is cute the fabric is beyond cheap its not just polyester its like a plastic polyester i think if you dress it up with high heels necklace armful of bangles you can probably distract from the fabric lb purchased xs and its a little big still,0
1428,On a positive note the dress was very well made great quality as usual from retailer however this dress looked like a sack i believe it may have been the combination of the drab color and the sack like shape very plain and unflattering for reference i am lbs c so i do have a shape it just did nothing for me it had to go back,0
1429,Love these lightweight pants theyre beyond comfortable and the print is darling hope this designer has additional pieces next season,1
1430,I havent worn it yet i tried it on when i got it and like it alot,1
1431,I bought this top for work and going out it is a beautiful top that goes with many items in my closet like my red blazer grey blazer red cardigan etc it is very flattering the arm holes werent too big fit tts,1
1432,This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo absolutely garish the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties it just looks cheap the skirt is an antebellum nightmare i did not even want to try it on its that bad i considered adding a photo but was too horrifiedfor reference im approximately the height size of the model but it was shorter than the photo depictes i wanted to like it,0
1433,Nice basic topi will get plenty of use out of this love the neckline,1
1434,This is one of my favorite pieces simple classy and cozy,1
1435,Went to the chicago michigan ave location and found this gem in the take a peek section i think thats what its called anyway been looking for a plane white top to wear with a red lace pencil skirt and this fit the bill wore it today with a grey midi skirt and sneakers and looks adorable it does flare a little and makes me feel like im wearing a maternity top but i dont care i love it went back to another retailer location and purchased the lilac one cant wait to wear that one,1
1436,This is truly the best black dressyou can wear to sooo many things a long time keeper for the closet i felt it ran a little bit bigi am normally an i bought both sizes and kept the but felt i could even get away with a but didnt want to pay shipping again for another size i am and lbs it is truly a flattering dress for any figure,1
1437,I wore this dress to nyc on a date it was perfectlight flowy and lovely the peach and green combination is really pretty and i love the hemline which is longer in the back than in the front i can only say one thing as i was walking down the street with my boyfriend a total stranger and not a crazy person came up to us and told us we looked beautiful enough said,1
1438,I really wanted to love this shirt the fit was great and the fabric just felt beautiful luxurious soft and flowing but the collar was frayed in addition the little keyhole area fabric also had to be carefully handled to make it look smooth and not like bad workmanship i put it aside to return it then this morning went to have another look at it wanting to talk myself back into it but i cant overlook the fact id be ordering a new shirt that would look timeworn it may be only this,0
1439,These jeans are my new favorites very flattering cut and color and very high quality ive worn them a ton since i got them and they havent stretched out or lost their shape at all only thing i would caution is that they run small for reference i wear a in paige denim a in citizens and was perfect in these,1
1440,I fell in love with this dress when i saw it i love the colors and pattern ive just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame im a size right now i do like it with or without the tie for different effects one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only i usually dont buy dry clean clothes but might make an exception for this one,1
1441,I received this as a gift it is a very pretty top but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasnt torn completely you could see it fraying the sales associate said they get many returns on this item,0
1442,My new favorite i wouldnt have thought twice about this dress handling on a rack in store but after seeing so many cute pics of ladies in this dress i caved i needed a petite so ordered a sp and xsp the length on both is perfect im and both hit above my knee in front and hit at in back and on sides i didnt try on a regular in store but based on the spxsp im pretty sure thered be too much material for a petite frame the xsp is cut slimmer and if i had a tiny waist id proba,1
1443,Great jacket warm as a coat yet thin enough to wear indoors i dress up with a fitted dress or dress down with jeans very versatile and comfortable i always get compliments on it,1
1444,I am a sucker for a peasant dress i love anything i can toss with a pair flats and head out the door but this dress is ridiculous i look like a schoolmarm the white bib collar takes this dress into costume territory i love one september and have many items from the brand that i wear regularly so im bummed that this wasnt what i expected i knew it would have flow but its more billowy than i wanted stay away unless you want to look like a little girl on the first day of school,0
1445,This is probably my new favorite bathing suit the colors are a tad different than in the picture but still really pretty,1
1446,Fits perfect tank top or bath top swings nicely and not too tight on top i ordered large and am a d sits perfect not long not short,1
1447,I purchased this top in the black color and absolutely love it it is very fun and can be either dressed up or down i would wear this to work as well as out and about around town it is worn loose so i ordered a size down i cannot wait to wear it through spring and summer,1
1448,This sweater is the kind of find i hope for when i browse the retailer website or walk into the store i tried two sizes i sometimes wear an s and sometimes an xs these days and after trying them both i felt that with this sweater it was better to err on the side of snugness the hooks and eyes pull a bit but i wont be fastening this all the way to the top the smaller size works better to hug my waist before the peplum flares out the color is a dreamy pinky nude more pink than nude an,1
1449,Looks so fun and whimsical on love love love this for photos especially,1
1450,I noticed the reddish one actually barneypurple in my local store and had to try it one since i like this cut of dresses from my teenage years the color was my main concern but this proved perfect overall it is low cut in the bust but a scarf can fix it for us modest girls there were quite a few loose threads on the lace and stiching that i had to trim off for the reference i am lbs and an xs was perfect,1
1451,Loved it i am curvy and it is very hard to find a dress that looks easy and at the same time shapes you the various cuts of the different prints are placed in the right place in the body easy dress and beautiful there should be more dresses in this style in different color combos,1
1452,This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami skinny jeans and boots im wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline my only slightly negative comment is about the quality the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut still keeping it though,1
1453,This sweater is a perfect transition piece the material is really soft while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesnt make you look like a big blob,1
1454,This top fits exactly like the last photo which was my hope it is not as slim as the other images its a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size and the mock turtleneck is not too high the fabric is thick so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall,1
1455,Love this tank its nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms its very forgiving if you have a midsection its soft and great colors really nice for spring casual looks,1

1459,I am in lust with this fabulous dress its a feast for the eyes its so busy and detailed yet it all works fit on me is perfect i did not have to size down or up my upper torso is larger ml than my bottom half ms i also have a square waist this dress makes me look like i have an hourglass figure i love it as much as the mona dress another point goes to ease of putting it on i own six byron lars dresses and this is the easiest one to put on just zip up and go,1
1460,The fit on these pants is just right for me i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs these pants dont gap in the back as fitted pants often can easy to dress up or down the color hasnt held up as well as i hoped so take care when laundering,1
1461,Saw this in the store and just had to have it beautiful design fits perfectly looks nice with a belt as well,1
1462,I just saw this in the store and loved it it is shorter than pictured on the model but its not short with a long shirt underneath ill wear it with leggings the color is beautiful the size does run large i normally wear a large at retailer and i got this in a medium i cant wait to wear it all fall and winter long,1
1463,I own another dolan dress which is virtually the same as this but has long sleeves i wear the longsleeved one whenever i give presentations or readings the material is absolutely genius for travel just unpack shake it out and youre good to goi love the sleeves on this shortsleeved version im fairly fit but at my age im not excited about showing off my arms the drape is beautiful and i can wear high heels bootees or flats with it i bought the red sometimes you cant tell if the c,1
1464,This was so unflattering the bust was too high so it hit me weird on the boobs the green was a beautiful vibrant color but the fabric is so delicate that one wrong move would cause a snag,0
1465,I own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite the ombre design makes it stand out the embroidery is beautiful these are usually tops i throw on during my time offweekends and i have received many compliments on this one tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller,1
1466,I purchased the mauve dress from an retailer store last weekend during their off sale i absolutely can not say enough great things about this dress it fits beautifully the pattern on the material is so pretty and feminine once i got home from the store and tried the dress on again i immediately purchased the black one also i had to have it in black too such a great dress to wear to parties date night friends outings we are going to california in september and will be wearing these,1
1467,I just received this jacket in the cream color it is so cute you can change it from to full length sleeves i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper i love this jacket it is a good cross over from athletic to cas,1
1468,Ive been eyeing this dress for weeks finally i took the plunge and bought it the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful i know many of the reviewers said it was running large but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l no stretch im normally a size and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips definitely more of a shift than a swing however its still just lovely looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow,1
1469,This shirt is a ive been looking for an off the shoulder top that i can wear a bra with i almost never spend full price on retailer items but this one is worth every penny dont hesitate just buy it,1
1470,The sides scooped up a bit too much on me i was hoping to be able to tuck this into a skirt and wear to work but there were definitely some gaps that showed the side of my midriff back it goes,0
1471,The most amazingly versatile cardi youll ever own it goes with everything from boyfriend jeans and booties to black chiffon pleated skirt its soft and feminine and makes you feel like you look like a million dollars definitely worth the price,1
1472,Cute denim shorts that roll up or down perfect with everything,1
1473,Super comfy easy to put on and super cute you can dress it up and dress it down im usually a size s and the small fits fine but i think the xs would have fit better,1
1474,Great hopes but a sorry disappointment at this price one should be able to expect better pattern alignment as shown on model the pattern in the garment i received was poorly matched on either side of the button placket i am and ordered xxs garment was significantly oversized i would have had to order one and probably two sizes smaller to achieve a decent fit because of the oversizing the shape is more boxy than it appears in the catalog photo sadly this buttondown has to be retur,0
1475,Awesome light shrug goes with so many out fits over tees and dresses tts get one orange color is a pretty neutral,1
1476,I love this sweater its so fun and quirky and shakes up a regular sweater a little large but it fits the style,1
1477,First mermaidish skirt ever thats flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body the material is lightweight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment the color is a rich deep gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it runs large so size down,1
1478,I loved this shirt when it first arrived and i couldnt wait to wear it after one day of wear i went to hang the shirt back up and it was ripping on both sides of the middle back seem this shirt was not tight on me at all very disappointed,0
1479,I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying for a basic top like this but for the sale price they are great comfortable lightweight and flattering the black is a little sheer but nothing a tank underneath cant solve a good buy,1
1480,I adore these little joggers i was immediately drawn to the color army green and the little details i carry all my weight on bottom so i dont often wear many retailer bottoms im usually a i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised they are absolutely perfect they fit a little baggy as joggers do and go with just about everything mine did loosen a tad but not like the previous reviewer i highly recommend these cant wait to wear these throu,1
1481,Super soft comfy underwear i sized up and they fit perfectly normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit they dont ride up i ended up ordering more pairs super comfy without being too mom like,1
1482,I love how soft and substantial the fabric is the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully the ruffle detail is very flattering i have broad shoulders and this top looks great,1
1483,A great little dress that can be dressed up or down,1
1484,I am lbs and bought the petite which is what i normally wear and it fits perfectly the quality of the fabric and stitching is good not great and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment but for me the style the fit and the fact that it doesnt seem to show wrinkles at least not before washing turned it in to a keeper for me the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it i tried the ada belt with it but found i,1
1485,Love love love this dress fits like a glove beautiful details amazing quality im so happy with this dress and know ill have it for years,1
1486,I got this in black it can be casual or dressy very lightweight comfortable and flattering i collect black tops since i rarely wear any other color and this is now one of my favorites i think it looks totally different in the black than it does in the other colors more refined less casual this runs quite large i am a but needed the in this top,1
1487,Really love this bathing suit it fits very well definitely dont need to size up for this one flattering to my mombod and breasts that have seen perkier days excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer,1
1488,I absolutely love this tunic and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in the mail i thought it looked really cute in the photo here but its even better in person and is extremely flattering on so happy,1
1489,I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list im so happy with it its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso the pattern on the front is very flattering,1
1490,This beautiful soft swingy dress is oversized on me usually when someone reviews that a dress runs large but their body type is opposite mine i pick tts and of the time im right not so in this case the outer dress is very wide and the amazing super stretchy under slip is too large also debating on sizing down because of potential shrinkage after laundering i bought m and my stats are dress ends just above my kneesagreeing with the previous reviews th,1
1491,This top was a big disappointment i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size neither of them fit well but one was cut much smaller than the other ive had this problem with all of the numericallysized buttondown style of maeve tops i dont understand why in size this keeps happening thats why i purchase two of each usually one fits and the other doesnt this time unfortunately neither worked they both were too tight in the armsshoulders,0
1492,Super soft light fabric this dress is perfect for work or the weekends this brand is new to me but ill definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future,1
1493,My sales assistantstyle consultant watched the dresses i had collected to try on and how they fit and she brought this dress in with a silk cocoon wrap for me to try on i took one look on the hanger and made an assumption it would be too snug highlight every bump and i could not have been more wrong this dress is wonderful on it is the most flattering thing i have now in my closet you must try this on to see how flattering it is i am still stunned with how it looked and made me feel,1
1494,Love this jacket its soft and a beautiful shade of ivory perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans while still maintaining an elegant look,1
1495,Yes it runs a little large i usually get a s or m in tops but for this i bought a s i am lbs and i did not get the petite i feel like the regular hits me at the same area as the model in picture i went into retailer looking for a dress and walked out with this vest too had to have versatile stylish pockets good quality,1
1496,These pants are the perfect color and i love the detail of the zippered pockets i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well they were slightly loose but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small after an hour of wear i was swimming in these i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly um saggy i am inbetween a and and since the pants are detailed as slim fit i thought it,0
1497,Beautiful in every way you can never go wrong with black and white very lightweight since its not a lined dress so its perfect for our florida heat,1
1498,I completely agree with the other reviewers this top is easy to throw on with jeans or trousers and so comfy im with a ddd chest and i ordered in my normal medium which looks fantastic and if i wanted to i think i could have sized down for a more form flattering look but i love the ease of this top,1
1499,This top was very cute but super short and i am a short waisted petitie personthe waistline hits above your belly button looks very silly,0
1500,Ive already worn this dress times and i bought weeks ago easy to wear comfortable and flattering i love and wish it was available it more patterns,1
1501,I saw the colorblock horizon dress in my local store which sadly no longer carries petites in the redblack color combination and loved it the colorsblocking the fabric the length after ordering a few petite sizes online the only xsp was the greenblack although not what i would normally where colorwise i love this dress and the xsp is the only one that fits this dress runs large and on a smaller frame the sp looked shapeless and unattractive perfect length and attractive vneck that,1
1502,I paired this gorgeous top with a black vneck cardigan mother lookers and black booties and felt and looked so totally feminine and amazingi honestly lost count of the compliments that i received beading is sewn on tightly and the stitching on the embroidery has no loose ends i am and took the regular size small highly recommend,1
1503,I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber which i find holds up best over time i am b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs it fits perfectly i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern so cute it is slightly short on my frame so the shirt tail hems peeked,1
1504,I was really excited about this top since i have others from retailer that are similar in styling unfortunately it just didnt work out i am petite with a short torso and ordered my usual size and it was way too short in the front the top was also boxy and didnt sit right it just wasnt flattering cute top on the hanger but just not on me,0
1505,The photos online make it look like a comfortable relaxed lightweight early fallspring cardigan when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no shimmer as far as i can tell i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out but it didnt work it looks too rumpled and i dont want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed,0
1506,Wanted this dress several months ago but it was out of stock finally was able to order and very glad i did it is perfect it fits exactly as i had hoped the length is great right above my knee and it hangs beautifully looks great with my caramel colored boots and i received many compliments just hoping they do some more drop waist dresses especially for summer,1

1508,I absolutely love this sweater first of all its extremely comfortable i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off its cute as a casual around the house top but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with this sweater is definitely cropped in length which i normall,1
1509,I bought this shirt in every color i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is it is very versatile i wear it at networking semi formal events dinners going out with friends and everywhere i feel awesome with it,1
1510,I love this sweater it is very lightweight the knit is a wider weave so if you are cold natured be sure to layer and bring a jacket the fit is great it is very flattering on the back is lined and has the gray fabric that shows past the sweater hemline which adds to the uniqueness this could be dressed up or down i paired with a white tee and dark jeans and flats but will wear it next with nice pants and maybe a white collared blouse very happy with my purchase,1
1511,I purchased this jacket in the beige color from the black friday sale and have already worn it several times it is comfortable warm and stylish i love it so much i got it as christmas gift for a good friend and my sister as for sizing i do find saturdaysunday brand runs a little big i typically wear medium or size in tops and bought the jacket in a size small,1

1514,This blouse fit better than i expected looks great with jeans and is an easy go to top,1
1515,Nice fit stretchy fabric but they do not stretch out of shape or so much that they are too big after wearing for a few hours very true to size and great length i am going to buy another pair because i know once i wear these out i will want a backup,1
1516,Im extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive the pattern ans styling are slimming most importantly they dont slide down during your workout im and a size and the large fit perfectly,1
1517,This shirt style is boxy however the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable i love the look of the cuffs this is a fun shirt to wear,1
1518,The fabric colors and concept are fabulous but the pleating is overdone is it looks huge not swingyi am and lbs and even an xsmall was too billowy to be cute too bad its otherwise so great,0
1519,I purchased a medium i am lbs and it fit perfectly the navy is pretty dark almost black the fabric is very soft the cut is more form fitting in the top and then comes out to an a line it is not as bulky as some swing dresses in the photo it almost looks like a handkerchief hem but in real life it is less pronounced i have no negatives i would consider getting a second pattern if it goes on sale,1
1520,This is a very cute fall dress that can be worn in a myriad of styles from styling it with a pair of wedges and dark tights to donning a bolo and ankle boots heads will turn when you walk into the room,1
1521,I found this top to be quite flatteringthe slight give in the outer straps is necessary to allow for arm movement without issuei did not find it to diminish the aesthetic valuei purchased it in white and loved it so much that i ordered the black alsonot much of a pink person or i would have gotten that one tooclassic with a bit of a casual edgea must get,1
1522,I love this top and cannot wait to wear it the material is a nice weight the color is pretty and the fit is very flattering and comfortable be aware that it does have an elastic waist and the design is very delicately sewn and could tear easily,1
1523,I love this skirt i usually dont buy skirts of this cut because they make me look hippy but the fabric is so lightweight and flowing and yet it has structure the colors are great and go with many top options i wear it to work and casual outings it is my favorite clothing article in my closet right now,1
1524,Ive passed this dress by a number of times online but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo based on the reviews i ordered my regular size medium it fit perfectly i do think the cut is on the trim side but it isnt tight or fitted i probably couldnt eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress the fabric is buttery soft the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so,1
1525,Super cute blouse great with a jean jacket sleeved or sleeveless pleating is neat and a nice unique detail without getting to full usually a or small in blouses bought the xs made this decision based on the arm hole openings seemed a little large and set low on the small,1
1526,Great dress that is very flattering works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels perfect for travel because the material doesnt wrinkle would highly recommend this dress,1
1527,im tall lbs and d and the size fit me perfectly with just a bra on underneath when zipped up i plan on wearing tank tops or thin tshirts under it and leaving it unzipped im normally a size but at retailer im a in their jackets thin with a thin lining but stiff enough to hold its shape the front zipper also helps give firmness to the front edge the fabric is white with lots of beige embroidery and lace holes i have a feeling thi,1
1528,I got these jeans on sale and have been very happy with them they seem to go with everything just a really nice basic skinny jean to have lightweight with a little bit of give they fit tts for me and hit about an inch and a half longer on my legs than the model in the picture im ive had them for a couple of months now and keep expecting them to show some wear in the knees bc of how often i wear them not yet any marks on them have come off easily in the wash overall very happy,1
1529,This dress is so flattering and comfortable i got the green which is not too green this is the perfect dress for a spring day and can be dressed up or dressed down,1
1530,Looks professional but wears like a sweater so comfy,1
1531,I love the coh fleetwood jeans and since i was looking for a pair of notsoskinny skinny jeans i thought these would be great but unlike the fleetwoods which are a substantial weight denim these are very soft too soft and bag out in the first minutes the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering maybe if youre looking for jeans you can lounge in these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats,0
1532,Such a cute skirt but impossible to get on ordered in an xs i have a waist but could barely get it past my knees to step into if you have any hips at all unfortunately this skirt wont work i was tempted to size up but once i got it on it fit great in the waist and already had too much material to size up to a small,0
1533,I absolutely love this dress its great quality and fits perfectly,1
1534,This is a great cut and looks good on it is a very poor quality material it balled and frayed in two wears i returned it to the store,0
1535,I wanted to like this so much its a great good girl dress church dress however it makes no sense its a summer dress with massively thick lining that snags im petite and busty and it made me look and feel very wide,0
1536,I cant say enough about this sweater it light delicate soft vintage chici could go on and on buy it already,1
1537,I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra its soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it its comfortable so thats a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though,0
1538,Great color and fit and feminine,1
1539,I bought the red cardigan because i didnt have anything similar and was so pleasantly surprised by the fit and design that im going have to buy it in whatever other colors are available its very versatile looks great tied in front in back at the side and has a tiny bit of flare at the bottom so its more feminine and flirty than your average cardigan i have a few tops by this brand and have been really happy with the quality and design,1
1540,Love the skirt colors are nice fabric is thick enough to go to fall but not too thick for summer ti is short so has room the colors are somewhat brighter in person but not summer bright more fall bright not sure htat makes sense love the flower pattern it is pretty but strong at the same timenow on to fit the waist is the small part my usual was snug on the waist but the skirt was perfect everywhere else not sure about sizing up yet as it may flare out too much will g,1
1541,I love this top i typically wear small in most retailer tops and decided to size down in this to an xs and im glad i did well made and cute floral design that can be worn year round,1
1542,Great style can be dressed up or down,1
1543,Saw this tee on line and thought id give it a shot the fit is very complimentary and the material is heavenly i get lots of raves about the casual yet pretty style too great shirt,1
1544,So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived i was sooo excited but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt with my long torso things are generally too short on me im a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under bucks i say that yet im not sending it back,1
1545,I love these jeans perfect amount of stretch perfect color perfect weekend i bought two sizes smaller than normal a little snug when they come out of the dryer but within an hour they are the perfect fit,1
1546,This dress didnt work for me at all im ft tall lb i usually wear size l but based on the reviews i ordered an m the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy color is about the same as pictured also length is appropriate dress is very thick and warm the fabric however has no stretch at all dress is very specious and shapeless there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders sleeves i thought that area was tight snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe,0
1547,I took advantage of the summer tag sale and bought a few tops including this one ive been eyeing this online for quite some time so i was pretty excited to get it at such a good price it came in the mail the other day its like christmas morning when you see an retailer package at your door however this time wasnt so great the top is fine average at best the top fits true to size maybe its the pattern or the cut but it didnt work well on my body i recommend trying this on first,0
1548,Very pretty and delicate top it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered bib style the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton just that part the back could be a little thicker so more durability still as it is its a niece piece and good qualityi find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin,1
1549,Cute and comfy seems to fit true to size flattering and roomy on top for my ddd shape but doesnt make me look pregnant or fat overall which sometimes happens without a waist to define shape super cute,1
1550,This will be a favorite sweater this winter it has a loose but flattering fit i purchased the red a deep rusty red and it fits me exactly as it does the model picturedslightly loose but flattering mid hip open neckline you cant tell in the picture but the neckline is rolled i am lbs just a bit fluffy the small fits me perfectly i think that you could size down from your regular size if you prefer a closer fit the sleeves are at the top of my hands just below the wri,1
1551,I purchased the gray motif with the bright flower design i have owned many blouses in my lifetime but i must say this is one of the best fitting and most attractive of most any i have ever owned it falls just right on my body and is smooth and luxurious with a silky feel the cuffs fall on my wrists just perfectly the color is just right for my fair skin and light hair this was my first order from you and if this is any indication of the quality and fit i will receive ill do a lot more ord,1
1552,I was a little apprehensive about getting this dress without any reviews but i am really glad i did first it looks exactly as pictured maybe even more beautiful the material is nice and flowing and very light so its going to make a fantastic summer dress there are two layers an under layer which can be completely detached from the pink silk top layer the reason why i say true to size is that even though the pink silk layer is pretty loose the bottom layer conforms more your body i,1
1553,Im on the smaller end of the bust spectrum even nursing im a cd at my fullest i adore this suit there is zero support so if you need that move on dont buy this i love it hides the post partum baby puff pattern detracts from flaws deep plunge is modest yet still sexy and its super stretchy and easily be pulled aside to feed a baby underneath theres a fabric bra insert so if you bend over nothing can be seen which i like havent worn in water or waves yet but fabric feels awesome,1
1554,I bought this item in green and then ordered it in red very comfortable fabric and flattering by itself or over leggings these tunics will be staple in my closet i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses but i ordered a small to have it a bit more fitted instead of baggy good decision,1
1555,Love this t i now have all the colors it is so soft and comfortable great with jeans or dressed up with leggings and boots and when i feeling lazy i just keep it on and use it as a night shirt to sleep in its that comfortable i found the size to be spot on,1
1556,Too much material everywhere i am lbs and i ordered an xs as usual i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors nice green slip though i will return it asap this is superugly,0
1557,I got the sweater in red id call it more orange its a bit of a baggy fit not tight which i love i feel like this will be a perfect cover up for cool summer evenings i got a medium i go between small and medium and i love the fit i could have gotten a small but i liked it looser the buttons are special too,1
1558,I absolutely love this dress beautiful prints and design i would say to size down though as it is rather flowy i am normally a small and went to an xs and it fits much better this is definitely a keeper,1
1559,Love this shirt can dress up or more casual wish i would of purchased all colors,1
1560,I have had this shirt for a little over a month ive wore it maybe times and there is a small hole in the middle of the sleeve on my shoulder its not even on a seam so i cant fix it i expect much better quality from retailer dont buy this the quality is very disappointing which is really unfortunate because this is a very nice fitting shirt and goes well with pencil skirts,0
1561,Hi i bought these in moss for both of my daughters they love them the material is substantial and washes beautifully the fit is straight up and down and is not forgiving on figure flaws i would recommend this to a thin figured girl,1
1562,I needed an outfit for my sons christening weeks after he was born one thing i have to keep in mind with purchasing items now is how well they work for easy breastfeeding this jumpsuit was perfect dressed up with a cropped tuxedo jacket cute shoes and jewelry i felt so chic and not only did it fit my new postbaby shape but was awesome for nursing him when needed i felt comfortable all day and look forward to dressing it down for less formal occasions the material is so soft and i,1
1563,Lovely material and the white is like a milky white which i love it hangs beautifully irons well and fits great i am an a cup lbs and ordered the small ive already received a lot of compliments on it,1
1564,This is very cute its lined its smocked its longer on me than the model in the picture i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees which works well for me it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer,1
1565,Did not work for me whatsoever the stripes were adorable but the piece just didnt fit like on the model the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didnt make my figure look the way it normally does aka i looked frumpy and chunky which im not going back,0
1566,I really love this jumpsuit i purchased it for my honeymoon and my husband loved it i am and pound and i purchased the petite xxs it fits very well it is a comfy thin and lightweight material not too fitted but definitely hugs my butt and thighs more than my stomach and chest i absolutely love this jumpsuit colors are more brilliant in person the only reason i put stars for the quality is because the first piece i ordered had a defective snap i reordered the jumpsuit aga,1
1567,I was walking to the fitting room and i saw two of this dress on a rack an xs and small i could tell by looking at it that it runs small so i grabbed a small to try on i didnt want to love this dress its expensive but i did it is so pretty and flattering i wish it were an inch or two longer but its ok with tights in the fall will be fine not sure i would wear this to work as i am a teacher and it is too short for me it definitely runs small i am between a and a so i took t,1
1568,I ordered a small im usually a petite small i like my tees not fitted i will exchange it for an xs soft it has like the look of a seam down the middle of the back i barely noticed it i think it makes a plain tee shirt a little unique good quality percent cotton its a white tee soft,1
1569,This is so comfortable and flattering and hides everything but yet is fun i actually love to wear it with jeans and it goes great with a really great piece of jewelry,1
1570,I love this despite the split sleeves the day it arrived i paired it with a black boucle midi skirt from retailer jewelry and mid high black slings and we to out to dinner with friends several people complimented me so it must have looked as id hoped i have worn it one other time with straight legged pants and a cashmere cardigan and felt comfortable and a bit more dressed up than usual slacks jeans and shirts it is soft feminine and comfortablethe ubiquitous dress it up or dress it,1
1571,Bought the aqua because sizes were sold out the bright color will be a welcome change this winter among all my neutrals its lovely soft wellfitting and i only hope we have a few days in the south so i can wear it well worth the price would be a lovely wardrobe addition for any age changed by what its worn withshoes accessories,1
1572,I absolutely love this dress its a great summer dress thats flirty and fun i feel this dress runs pretty true to size except in the bust area the buttons at the top pull a little bit on me unless i wear a bra that pushes the girls up and together im a ddd just so you have an idea im about lbs and im a in dresses im usually able to get away with a i have a bigger bust and bum but a super tiny waist im just barely able to get away with wearing a in this dres,1
1573,These pants are gorgeous they are not a denim material more like the softest khakis youve ever felt theyre very flattering and hug all the right places i am a in pants and the feels great a worthy investment,1
1574,This too is so beautiful in person there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming i love this top with business attire and denim fits tts,1
1575,I bought these pants on a whim while i was at my local retailer i was so delighted after trying them on because ive never tried on a pair of linen pants that i actually liked they definitely have more of a flair leg rather than straight leg like the picture suggests i wore them for several hours at a party and they didnt stretch that much on me i agree with the other review in that they do get a little wrinkly but not much more than what i would expect from linen fabric im so t,1
1576,Loved the fit the size was true and it felt so soft on,1
1577,The pictures online do not do this justice i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe it can actually be worn ways i like closing the closest snaptheres two in the middle with a skinny belt over it and a slip dress underneath this way the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking think s glam it can also be fully closed like in the picture or left ope,1
1578,I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too the weight of the material makes it hang nicely there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style i got many compliments of this top,1
1579,Beautiful choicebeautiful fit for my daughters slim body,1
1580,I bought these a great alternative to black jeans but they are headed back the texture is nice but lets call them what they are thin leggings not worth the price in my opinion honestly i cant seem to find a pair of pilcros that i like so id spent the extra money on a better pair of black jeans,0
1581,This top is even better than pictured the colors are brighter though still natural this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it i ordered a large my usual size and would say its pretty loose but doesnt look ridiculous it just hangs well and fits the way it should the fabric is a little thin so youll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you dont want your bra to show through,1
1582,I definitely would recommend this top when i put it on i felt it was true to size and fit me very well sometimes my retailer tops tend to be a little roomy but not in this case the fit was very nice and its embroidery details make it a special look that i can throw on with my jeans and still look put together i know this will be a top i wear often,1
1583,I loved this top so much i bought both colors soft and warm without being too thick or bulky,1
1584,These are lovely dressy pants but they act larger than they need to even for the model above see photos i usually order size in pants and size in these fit at the waist but felt bulky below partly because of large pockets made of the same material another detail to note there is metallic thread running thru out the material glinting more than the photos show the golden vertical leaflets dont show as much because of the overall shine so i will return these lovelies because,1
1585,The colors and design of this dress is stunning i am usually a large in retailer clothes this dress is true to sizethis can be worn as a dress with boots or flats or even as a tunic i purchased a scarf to also wear it with this is one of my all time favorite retailer pieces dont hesitate,1
1586,Great shorts ive been buying these for the past few years each year i add to my collection with new colors i have pairs now perfect length and can be rolled if needed to show some more leg,1
1587,This is a great staple for laid back weekend wardrobe the inside of the pullover is soft like sweatshirt material and its comfortable enough to sleep in also cute enough to wear out with jeans i would definitely recommend this sweatshirt im typically a size in retailer i ordered this shirt in a size and i love the fit,1
1588,Fits great and the material feels great on going to buy a second one in a different pattern,1
1589,This is such a fun happy dress i saw it in the store on the rack that has online returns so there was only one available to try on it was a size and i usually wear a in retailer brands i loved the dress and tried it anyway and it fit perfectly which is why i think it runs a bit large for reference i am and lbs hourglass shape but a bit fluffy in the tummy and upper arms it has an empire waistline and a zipper in the back it is so light and airy and super comfortable it ha,1
1590,I love this top so much i bought it in colors the material is so soft and comfortable has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks just wish it wasnt dry clean only,1
1591,Quality piece except the fit is way off i have a c bust and long narrow torso larger on the bottom i ordered the small i frequently wear a smallextra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area however the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my foot frame i marked it as running small which it does on top but then it runs very large on bottom wanted it to work but didnt,0
1592,I bought these and returned them almost immediately the material looks nice but itchy and heavy the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear,0
1593,The most beautiful top in my closet and i have a huge closet of beautiful clothes hope retailer carries more peasant top by this brandstunning,1
1594,I love this shirt i wore it to a friends baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it the neckline and shoulders and very flattering but then im not very busty so maybe thats why it worked for me the material is handwash only but well worth it for such a unique pretty top i also didnt get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff,1
1595,Dont know why but i didnt have high expectations for this dress turns out its uber flattering makes my waist look tiny accentuated bust perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking top half unlined and a bit thin color is almost pearl very very light gray im between xss b lb and went with a small hits an inch above knees sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett,1
1596,This is such a lovely piece i usually wear a medium in moth i am pounds and the quality is exceptional i highly recommend this sweater coat,1
1597,The colors of this top are even better in person the blue is easy to pair with denim and there is no need to accessorize the print does all the talking it is a bit wide on the bottom and the print material is pretty thin it definitely looks like something not everyone else has worth the splurge,1
1598,I bought this top in ivory and love it im lbs and dd i usually wear a small or but sized up to a i have no issues with the fabric this is a steal for the sale price,1
1599,As others have said this is even prettier in person beautifully made colors are really pretty its unique and special in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium depending on the cut i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i dont need it it doesnt run large its just that i wanted it to be closer fit as ill wear it with skinny jeans or leggings,1
1600,These pants are just what i wanted to work out in something bright cheery and feminine theyre super comfortable and fit perfectly im typically a so i ordered the xs and they are just right,1
1601,So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite i didnt have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot the dress came today and it fit great i am so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable the material and cut is great this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition,1
1602,I thought i would love this shirt because it goes along with my style but i returned it immediately it runs so large the colors are faded and the trim of the shirt curl over so it looks cheap and frumpy i do not recommend this it hits in all the wrong places,0
1603,This top fits so well and looks much better on than in the picture,1
1604,This shirt is a simple but versatile top it goes anywhere with anything so its a great travel piece im curvy on top but short waisted and this shirt does a good job of disguising that figure flaw i got loads of compliments from men who liked the femininity that stops short of sugary as one guy put it its quite comfortable and doesnt bunch up when one sits down i wore it with copper jewelry and that really made it pop a great piece for ones wardrobe,1
1605,This dress is very pretty versatile and high quality im planning to wear it to a wedding with the holiday season coming up i will definitely get to use it as well the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part its very soft i usually wear an xs petite this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but its manageable i have this dress in ivory top,1
1606,This is a delightfully soft and fluffy sweater i might have bought it if my store had the petite size the white was pretty and a good weight not too light or heavy and comfortable it would be fun to layer over various outfits it did not seem to shed,1
1607,It was huge material looked good but was too bulky will be returning it,0
1608,I sadly only noticed this top once on sale i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big i would need the petite so i had to leave it behind lbs dd but it is adorable can be dressed up and classy casually with jeans or sweetly so many ways love the subtle polka dots oh well i am sure i will find something similar i love,1
1609,The material is so thin and so itchylike other reviewers statedit itches so bad and feels like sandpaperi thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,0
1610,Really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews even with the sale price and addtl discount its basically blouse fabric with design and detailwork of a much more expensive blouse the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily if it were black you could probably get away with it but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle sad to have to send it back,0
1611,I absolutely love this dress i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments i have also worn it over leggings and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals even though the material is somewhat thin i did not have to wear a cami with it the fabric pattern is really cute,1
1612,This dress is magical i wore it to a christmas party and felt like the belle of the ball my dress swirled around me as i spun on the dance floor later i spilled a tequilaginger all over the front i was devastated but it almost instantly dried and there are no stains you cant even tell i spilled it is handwashable which is great as well i am and lbs the xxsp fit like a glovehighly recommend any other dress would have been ruined but this one was literally magical,1
1613,Saw this in the store and had to have it after i tried it on its shape is unique its very floaty and looks awesome with skinny cropped jeans chunky sandals the empire does hit across the breast line not below i thought it added to the different shape didnt look odd on me i am so it might overwhelm a petite frame,1
1614,This dress is so pretty in person the colors are great the blue and green and just beautiful in person the fit is tts i happen to have a blue belt and could style it just as the model has but really it doesnt need it it is super flattering even without a belt i am just a hair shy of and i cannot wear flats or it would drag the floor but adding a wedge is perfect to keep it off the floor no hemming needed i dont usually pay full price but i am glad i did in this case,1
1615,Truly adorable as other reviewers have mentioned much better in person than as pictured the ivory has black khaki and light pink polka dots it is great with a pencil skirt or pants,1
1616,Loved this dress it does run a little long even with high heels i am and probably would have beenbetter with a petite size often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit not sure if i will hem it the print is pretty however busy i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic i added an black belt w,1
1617,This ran a bit small im normally a this was a and just fit the pattern was very digi the length was shorter than i hoped im and the fabric while structured was just cheap and acrylicfeeling pass,0
1618,The top is adorable but probably better to wait for a sale as the full price is a little high for a simple top like this i got the print one and its very true to size,1
1619,Maeve did it again great material vivid color and amazing fit i tried this dress on weeks ago but didnt purchase when i saw that they were having a sale i couldnt get to the store quick enoughladies if youre bottom heavy like i am then this dress will make you look awesome,1

1621,So glad i bought this its beautiful and being on sale made it even better good quality and versatile highly recommend,1
1622,I wasnt sure about the dress on the rack lace can either look amazing or make you look like a doily it was on sale so i figured why not lets try it on it is gorgeous on true to size i am usually a and the fits me perfectly the quality and tailoring is amazing it is a heavier dress with the lace and lining so it may not work on a super hot day overall i love the fit and quality of the dress i love it even more on sale,1
1623,What a beautiful dress a size fit me perfectly lbs i have a small ribcage so it works on me but it might be too tight for someone with a larger one the fabric is of amazing quality and i was so glad to see there is a liner under the skirt the top has some delicate beading which looks great but i am concerned it will fall off at some point i have found that retailer clothing tends to have loose buttons and beading i have not washed it yet so i am hoping it holds up otherwise i am,1
1624,I caught a sneak peak of this beautiful dress on a local retailer instagram pageand i was so excited when it arrived at my store i love this dress i went with the black because i loved how bold it was its ultra feminine and flowy the slip underneath has the prettiest embroidered print and the overlay is light and airy the bottom is hemmed with a little lace peekaboo and it is wonderful i tried this on in both a l and an xl the xl fit well but the dress was a little long on top so i wen,1

1628,I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends a great value if youre looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of you can wear the two pieces separate or together i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing,1
1629,This casual top is adorable a great top for jeans linen pants or shorts it would be cute with skirts too i love the heavy feel of the fabric too many fabrics today are thin andor clingy this is soft but is substantial it works well on my bodytype tall thin without much figure its not cheap but something ill likely keep for a few years,1

1631,If there ever was the perfect feminine dress this would be it,1
1632,I bought this jacket in green and it is beautiful the green is a trueforest green sizing is accurate my only wish is that they offered more colors and the snaps were double faced so you could snap the collar back,1
1633,This is beautiful the colors are rich though the pink is slightly more noticeable than the model image the length was just shy of my knees at and the fit was overall swingy i am happy with my normal size s though i would be curious to see how the xs fits too i suspect that it would be too tight in the shoulders but fit everywhere else better one major difference that slightly annoys me is that the sleeves are not long as shown in the model shot the flared portion starts at about m,1
1634,I love the design on this top its a little thin but its held up great with a few washes,1
1635,I love this tshirt the moss green color is just what i wanted cute fit and true to size purchased the medium bc i like tshirts to be a little loose,1
1636,Easy to wear but still has a lot of style i see this becoming a new basic,1
1637,After reading all the reviews i thought i would have to size up went into my local retailer and found this dress in a size burnt orange color last one in stock it was still marked so i think thats why it was still there i crossed my fingers and tried it on it fit perfect not to short or tight in the upper sleeve im so maybe thats why the lenght was fine on me if you can find this in your local store try it on its really cute and comfortable i also have the front lace up j,1
1638,Id been eyeing this for months loving the look but afraid itd be too young for me im i tried it on in the store and loved it with one caveat it hangs rather like a sack so i think it needs a belt for waist definition with a belt it looks great my measurements are and i wear a medium oh and contrary to what other reviewers have said i dont find that the fabric is too thin or transparent,1
1639,I have been looking for a cuddly yet nice looking sweater like this one for a long time i love anther as they always deliver what i am looking for,1
1640,I love this vest and could not leave without it the color and lining just make it perfect so stylish and comfy im always a and a m in this was perfect the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down i am big on the bottom the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest love love,1
1641,The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color not black its also perfect for spring summer and early fall super comfy casual yet elegant size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe,1
1642,Love the pattern and material not thick for spring and summer like the fit and style im ive purchased regular not petite front and side zip with internal button charlie trousers earlier this year and last year got a size i vary between size and in the front zip trousers and they stretched out and got a little loose after fitting perfectly so i got the side zip in size those were tighter initially and stretched out but are still snug with this particular p,1
1643,Beautiful dress i ended up getting it in both the red and the green the fit is absolutely perfect and it flatters pretty much any figure one thing i would say is that you should get your exact size if possible i ordered it online because it was so pretty in the p i happened to be in the store the next week and i ttried on the r in the store just to see how it looked and it was awful i was so disappointed but then my dress arrived in the mail and the p fit me perfectly im so glad retailer,1
1644,I saw this jacket in stores but did not buy it i went home but could not get this trendy jacket out of my head i returned to the store the very next day and purchased this item i am very pleased with the quality and think that the fit could go well on most body types i got the denim color which may not be the best color for all but i love it because denim is timeless and very versatile i would suggest this to anyone and could not be happier with this go out and buy it now you wont re,1
1645,The design of this dress was very off for my lb d frame its lowcut and tight in the bust but then very voluminous and unstructured around the hips making me look wide there a belt didnt help much the fabric is nice but the overall effect of the dress was frumpy,0
1646,The shape is awkward too loose not flattering my body just disappears under all the fabric and the bird print wasnt as cute as online returning this one,0
1647,I bought the navyivory patterned one in size i loved the details of the faces so much that i ordered a second one in the same pattern on sale now i see theyre still available on clearance so i have a rd the ivory with pastel stripes the length is perfect its comfortable washes well and has personality i love these i should have bought the other whimsical prints ive had good use out of them this summer and will in the colder months too,1
1648,Awesome jeans cute and comfortable size down as they run a little big,1
1649,I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail when it arrived i was very disappointed the color is more mauve than dusty pink and the fabric is stiff and wrinklednot at all what i expect velvet to be flowy and soft the fabric seems very cheap for the price point i usually like floreat but this one is headed right back to the store,0
1650,I purchased the gorgeous green color i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when its cooler outside the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it,1
1651,Not as pink as pictured online definitely more of a pale peach fits loose so im glad i went with my normal size or would seem boxy cute top and will wear it around town running errandsinstead of my activewear,1
1652,Super easy date or work dress its a little small in the bust so i had to size up but otherwise a great fit,1
1653,Love this top off the shoulder fits great little extra room around the torso than id love but still absolutely in love with this top the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing love the colors for fall ordered a small and im lbs and i ordered a small,1
1654,This is so pretty in person and really nice quality with soft velvet stitched on beading is very firmly sewn on great fit runs a tad small i am a curvy size but as with many flowyswingy retailer tops i needed a small to not be swimming in it perfect with skinny jeans and booties and cant wait to wear it this holiday season,1
1655,As other reviewers said this top is rather boxy but i assumed it ran big ordered a size down i love it i ended up buying it in both black white personally i dont find it too short it hits on me just below the waist of my jeans it covers up my tummy which no one needs to see but still looks youthful the little ruffle detail front seam take it from boring basic to something special enough to feel put together by just pairing with cute jeans i generally wear a dd bra,1
1656,Runs a bit tight around upper arms love the collar,1
1657,This sweater is stunning it is extremely well made tons of tiny little embellishments that get noticed even by the most discerning eye ive received so many compliments on it if you want it to fit generously or with extra roominess i recommend ordering one size up it fits true to size,1
1658,Love this layering piece a little low cut for my personal comfort but a tank underneath works great,1
1659,I adore these jeans i bought them in a size but probably could have gone with a i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased the fit is flattering the color is perfect i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits the waist is a little higher than im used to but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the sagging out issue that my older paige skinny jeans havei love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes mo,1
1660,Wasnt sure what to expect but i like it ordered size large and its a perfect fit the color is a blush beige it falls at the top of my hips i dont think you need a camo under it because the holes are small its a sweater type knit thats substantial but not heavy love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length,1
1661,I have trouble finding pants that are long enough and also narrow enough on my hips these fit like a glove and never stretch out,1
1662,Love my jeans fit great and very flattering they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit receive compliments every time i wear them if they go on sale i will buy another,1
1663,I love pajama pants by this company i have a couple now and they are all so soft and lightweight,1
1664,Pretty obsessed with this top it feels like a cotton poncho its definitely made to be oversized and flowy it even hangs off the shoulder some it does run very large im normally a medium to a large and i purchased the xs never ever an xs normally even still its loose as its designed to be so definitely size down sizes other than that super comfy and a casual top that can be worn to make my leggings and flip flops a little more fancy would also be nice with jeans for a casual,1
1665,I love this shirt i ordered a medium and the sleeves were very long and the shirt was wide in general i returned it for a small and it is perfect size down i love the comfy gauzy feel of this shirt,1
1666,Love this sweater lightweight comfy and does run large i usually wear a size or lxl in sweaters cause i dont like them to fit tight i read reviews and ordered a medium and its perfect cant go wrong i ordered the red but am now thinking of ordering the grey one,1
1667,My imagination went wilt with all of the possible combinations for this vest dressy and casualwith jeans or slacks long or short pencil leather toobest gift to date,1
1668,The lines on the dress are lovely the material is a nice thick jersey which can be bodyhugging but mostly on top it falls beautifully and looks good with heels and flats and boots i am xs or s depending on the dress and i got the xs in this one,1
1669,I didnt mind the scratchiness others proclaimed this garment had but it is made very tight in the arms and across the back looks great from the front but uncomfortable,0
1670,Beautiful color gorgeous chic design and great material,1
1671,If you look closely at the photos the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth the sweater fits tts i am lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath it is a midweight nylonviscosecashmere knit with understated black cotton rope snails on the pockets theres nothing boring about it as is often the case with longsleeved navy blue cardig,1
1672,I was feeling defeated in my search for a dress for some upcoming holiday parties while shopping today i saw this dress in the dressing room as another customer was trying it on she was a shorter petite woman and this dress looked amazing on her it instantly caught my eye and it looked great on her i went and was lucky enough to find a size lately ive been closer to a sadly and was worried this was going to be another bust im and much curvier than the woman i saw in the dressi,1
1673,Just received this and absolutely love it i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same since online exclusive which it does this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees a fence and sheep on the sleeve very cute its a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off,1
1674,Great fit smooth comfortable material wrinkles but nothing an iron cant fix beautiful colors i got both the teal and the black,1
1675,I have several lilka pj bottoms and im glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection tts soft flannel striking colors only wish they had pockets,1
1676,This is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions two other people in my family own this dress and love it its now my turn to add it to my collection the dress is quite long for my frame so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing very elegant a little chanel like and by the way the belt is included as another reviewer,1
1677,Love all pilcro this is no exception very flattering slim fit but not skin tight comfy,1
1678,Dress looks beautiful but the fitting is very off i ordered a size which is the dress size i usually wear im and lbs the chest area fits perfectly but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose i exchanged it for a the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose if i ordered the p i have a feeling it would be too tight it feels like its meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen also this dress is very stiff cant d,0
1679,This dress is so pretty on i almost didnt try it on because on the hanger it didnt look like it would have any shape well it is super drapey and flowy and it looks great on almost swing style it is doubled up on fabric and with the longer sleeves i was scared it would make me too hot but the fabric is light and breathable it will be a perfect transitional dress for fall and early spring fyi the eyelet strip on the front and back are see through didnt realize that the first time i,1
1680,What a perfect summer dress after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and its perfect the slip is a little snug on the hips but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger i cant wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer,1
1681,I love love love this dress i am lbs and got an xs its just barely small on me but works great it looks amazing and i cant always wear maxi dresses they dont always work with my body type this one is perfect the color is gorgeous i highly recommend this dress,1
1682,This really was nothing special for there are much cuter tops at retailer it wasnt particularly flattering as it was very boxy so it added volume it was soft and felt like decent quality which was nice i agree with another reviewer that the ruffles feel too big overall this was just a miss for me,0
1683,I ordered this blouse because it was such a good price on sale but should have paid closer attention to the reviews the slits on the sleeves are much more noticeable than in the photo and the blouse just didnt work for me something about it reminded me of seinfelds pirate shirt i appreciate retailers return policy i took it back to the store and got an immediate refund on my cc,0
1684,I ran into retailer to actually return a dress and saw this hanging in the petite section and had to try it at almost i can sometimes go between regular and petite sizing and thankfully i could grab the petite with this dress they didnt have the regular size its airy and summery i love the design of the swing its loose but not tent like the length came to about inches above my knee its not see though at all i had black bottoms on and you couldnt see them another plus it tha,1
1685,Very comfy and warm i love this i bought the xs even though i am usually a s or xs,1
1686,Great dress needs a tank top underneath but has a great shop,1
1687,This dress is loose unique and super cute youll get noticed in this dress i ordered down a size,1
1688,This is a very flattering top im pretty flatchested this top doesnt look too bad i love the subtle peplum it makes it a bit dressy im lbs got the xs,1
1689,I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress this was not it completely see through i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip its an odd design absolutely not worth the price i purchased the smmd and i could have for two of me in the dress returned this piece without looking back,0
1690,I was so excited to try this sweater on when it arrived but to my disappointment it was overly large i was pratically swimming in it really love the design and the way it looks on the model just didnt work out that way on me,0
1691,My daughter tried this on in the store yesterday and loved it it fits perfectly true to size the quality of the fabric and style is lovely a fun jacket to layer with,1
1692,This is such a great addition to my fall wardrobe this is so cute im and this fits perfectly i dont usually do well with some of the cropped pieces but this one has such a complementary cute the sleeves are just the right length ive had lots and lots of complements on this one its a keeper,1
1693,Loved this cute dress so easy and simple to wear i wore it with tannude sandals to keep it casual for the race track in saratoga so comfortable for this price it is a must have,1
1694,For reference i am about lb typically wear a size luckily they had it instore around me so i as able to try it on i read the reviews and first tired on a size down but it still didnt look quite right on me i was daring and tried on another size down and im glad i did there is no lie that it runs large its a beautiful dress and heavy enough to wear into the fall i will say it does still have a little tenty shape to it but its just the style of the dress,1
1695,This top is fun to wear looks great with black grey or my wine color jeans love it,1
1696,This is a great skirt and i have received so many compliments wearing it its soft as butter and adorable with the ruffle on the bottom i do find it runs small i usually wear a in jeans or a small in various tops and bottoms and occasionally find i can fit in a or xs but i purchased a medium in this skirt this is a very versatile piece so far i have worn it to work im and its not inappropriately short at all with tights heels and a jacket but im excited to style it for,1
1697,This top was just not flattering im and medium build and the m was very bulky and the fabric didnt fall in the right places made me look very round and im not so its definitely going back,0
1698,Purchased this in green and love the color it drapes well not too long on me and hung just past my hips it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath overall very happy with this purchase,1
1699,I love this suit the fit is incredible im unsure that the fabric will stand the test of time but i got it on sale and i dont know about you ladies but ill do anything for a great suit,1
1700,Very sheer inexpensive material even on sale im returning it,0
1701,I purchased this sweater in red its a deep rich color and although i usually opt for black you can see the beautiful details on this sweater much better in the red i love this item,1
1702,The shirt is beautiful but fits much too small the stitching limits the space in your shoulders and the hem too short a petite frame would be able to pull this off but i am a medium and the shirt didnt work in every direction,0
1703,I looked at this dress for a long time before i purchased it because of the money i wear a size p was entirely disappointed in the style and construction of this dress for one thing the lining is bulky and you could never wear it in warmer weather without burning up the dress as pictured looks very feminine and light weight silk but there is just too much material going on thick and heavy the overall fit was too big and very unflattering,0
1704,I thought the dress was ok but was surprised by the cut away triangles of material right under bra band on the sides of dress i will send back also a bit too high waisted for me other than that the dress is as it appears,0
1705,This top is my favorite of the season planning to order in black too,1
1706,When i was finally able to find my size available online i didnt hesitate i am lbs d and size jeans i originally ordered a smallwow was i surprised it was too small and cropped i returned and ordered a medium received todayand i have to say i was super happy it fit perfect in fact it fit much like how the models fit in the photographs,1
1707,Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer and ordered the light blue its tempting to get the red as well the fit is great i am and the length is perfect the skirt has weight i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again,1
1708,A great casual top for warm weather the linen ensures its structure stands out and the structure gives it more interest than a plan tee does a fine job of hiding minor midsection lumpiness can be dressed up a bit if worn with linen or cotton trousers i bought the yellow and was pleased to find it wasnt too transparent i bought the small and found it tts for an american small bigger than a uk or european small a versatile keeper,1
1709,I absolutely love this dress very well made fits like a glove and very flattering the fabric is stretchy which makes the fit perfect and comfortable i will be wearing this to a graduation and im sure ill find many other occasions to wear this dress,1
1710,Bought the gray online just to try it and ive already worn it times very soft love the flowiness and the scoop in the back gives it a slightly less casual touch without losing comfort the only concern i have is that it may pill up a little and not sure how it will hold up in the wash im lbs c curvymuscular frame and the size small was perfect true to size,1
1711,This darling dress has a fun boho vibe to it and the colorpattern would flatter a variety of skin tones a long necklace is a must with this dress it has a flowy drape below the waist so its a generous fit i purchased the medium,1
1712,I got this for my daughter teen who had been wanting this plaid look but didnt want to look like a lumberjack this is feminine and can be dressed up or down it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable she will get a lot of use out of this purchase new item but black friday discount yay purchased in red color,1
1713,I absolutely love the color cut and style of this maxi the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering the color and design is gorgeous as youd expect from rana gill i got my normal size and it was perfect i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress,1
1714,This sweater is so cute and seems high quality i would love to keep it but it is way too cropped for my taste going down just below my mid section i wish it had been cut longer i would have kept it,0
1715,This duster is light weight good for a inside a chilly restaurant but not really warm enough for cold outdoor winter weatherreally punches up a black on black outfit polished artsy interesting look runs large has a feel similar to a swing coat with less swingive received many compliments on this piece wear it with confidence it is on the bold side,1
1716,I love this sweater because it is so versatile it looks casual with jeans but i plan to wear it to the opera with dressy black slacks the beautiful black embroidery is unusual and asymmetrical in back,1
1717,I ordered this dress for my daughter she wore it to a wedding and it was beautiful looks just as it does in photo fabric is a nice weight and hangs great my daughter had her hair done and look right out of an retailer catalog well made true to size beautiful dress,1
1718,I love this jacket im tall lbs waist and a d i normally go for an medium and i bought a medium i love it slightly cropped barely snug fit but i can still snap it closed totally warm enough for california fallwinter i like that the sleeves dont have sherpa in them make it easier to layer i bought the silver corduroy and its less white than the photos but it still fits the bill perfectly love that its machine washable too it also has pockets,1
1719,This is a great summer dress i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies i kept the l because the fit was better the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful lots of compliments it is lined highly recommend,1
1720,Absolutely love this suit the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to it does not ride up at all which almost never happens with swim suits im going to order this in a different color next season i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments,1
1721,This pants the worst short that i ever hadi bought this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost colori was really shock definetly will return it to storefyi i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry,0
1722,Tried this on in the store in a small im a size in most retailer dresses and it was enormous im short so i knew id need a petite size ordered a petite small and the length is better still a lot of fabric but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top im a full d and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust definitely size down in this or youll be swimming in it,1
1723,Im so glad i bought this the picture doesnt do it justice its lightweight flowy and super comfy ill be wearing this all the time very lightweight so it doesnt get hot love the material its soft light and flattering color says light grey but it does have a bit of a bluelavender hue to it as another reviewer said i love cloth stone and this is one of my favorites well worth the money,1
1724,This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house its a really warm dress too so great for colder weather probably would not want to wear this dress in warm tempsits so comfortable and its made with high quality material im curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist its a pretty straight cut,1
1725,this was actually at my local retailer store it reminded me of another online exclusive that was a dress and had the same flower shapes but the color was a soft pink this is exactly like thatpros it is so lovely with the pleated front,1
1726,I ordered the ivory in size xl it is such a cute comfortable top all of the details are welldone the quality of the material is great too its a flowy fit after washing airdrying it does shrink a bit great tee for summer,1
1727,Im a sucker for beaded detailing so i couldnt resist this blouse its so beautiful and fun i cant wait to wear it,1
1728,I found this in your store and had to have it i wore it on a date night and received more compliments than i can count the attention to detail makes this jacket special i am ft inches lbs and a fits but a is perfect for a sweater underneath i actually went back a bought the other color worth every penny,1
1729,I am in between sizes and styles after having a baby this dress looks great on my curvy figure and enhances my look with the cinching of the belt and the detail of the flutter sleeves perfect length and really fits well i am very happy with it,1
1730,Love the design and print absolutely beautiful bathing suit would size up on the bottoms top is true to size,1
1731,I love these jeans they are flattering and dont sag after wearing them for a hour or two they look great with flats or booties,1
1732,A great white blouse i expected this top to be sheer and yet its quite opaque i bought the white in a size small i find it true to size and the silhouette is very flattering relaxed yet super polished look,1
1733,I have a love and hate with fit and fashion i love super beautiful clothes that are comfortable to wear normally i am the one everyone keeps asking where did you buy that and i inwardly roll my eyes because my rule of thumb is dress with the most comfortable thing i can now im also a full figured mama these outfit made me look chic parisian and made my derriere look like it was very attractive i have a long torso and a long neck and long legs and it hid my flaws so if you want to look lik,1
1734,These are my favorite flare jeans they have that lovely s style and go with everything and look great all year round the fit is perfect my all time favorite jeans,1
1735,Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee it was baggy hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless,0
1736,Love the material and how the back is longer than the front adds style,1
1737,I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly it is a clingier top but i didnt find it too much so the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be it has substance also it would be great for traveling because it doesnt wrinkle at all love that,1
1738,I really like this blouse its hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves dont stick out and look weird this one does not have this problem it is a bit sheer but i dont mind wearing a cami with it it is flowy but not boxybaggie has a very nice flattering drape im lbs c petite frame the regular fits great im often a petite especially in pants and long sleeved tops but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length,1
1739,I absolutely adore this top the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews i am glad i did so i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders however it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material therefore i feel a large feels like a medium in the,1
1740,I absolutely love this top i often shop the sale items first but when i saw this top in the store i didnt hesitate to pay full price the material reminds me of vintage clothing it is a dry clean only item but is so special that its worth it the colors and construction beautifully lined bias trim are impressive and this top looks better on me than on the model,1
1741,I was hesitant to buy but this tee is easy light and fun to wear the fabric is light but not see through in the slightest the construction is perfect it is tts for an oversized tee,1
1742,This wool jacket actually feels more as a cardigan its a little too thin for a jacket but looks about the same as pictured its very pretty i ordered a l and it was true to size sleeves are cropped the wool material is surprisingly soft and comfortable very nice and colorful addition to my closet recommend,1
1743,Bought this top in black and i love it fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine the top is very flattering and looked like the model the front is shorter but very flattering love it,1
1744,Im lbs ordered small fits perfect super soft denim love the color love the worn in feel,1
1745,I got this in white and was surprised to see that it fits me i am very petite but with a d bust and purchased the xxs this fit me perfectly the fabric is soft and kind of silky the straps were not too long the hem hit just at my hip line i am buying the other color,1
1746,This is a thick material but it is also airy i got the white and dont have to worry about it being see through it is a little boxy but the hem hits a good length and doesnt bother me really great for work in the summer and going between really hot and really cold temperatures a good basic piece that can be dressed up or down that is definitely worth getting,1
1747,This is the most beautiful dress ever im very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest this dress feels like it was made for me i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made while the lining might be too short for tall girls being only the lining is perfect the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so,1
1748,Finally received this in the mail today and was very disappointed i am swimming in the xs lbs the colors are much more vibrant that shown in the pics the green is a bright kelly green the red is much more red than rust colored etc and its a sweater coat for the price i was expecting it to be lined and higher quality i dont doubt that it will be warm but cant justify the price its going back to the store,0
1749,This this you have to buy i just tried it on in our new store the other night and am in love gorgeous details went into the sweater coat its thinner than most which is nice when you want to look lovely but dont quite need to bundle up i plan on purchasing after christmas if its still around,1
1750,This top is lace done extremely well i love the silk the double attached layer and the length dress it up or down this top is a definite show stopperit does run small in the arms though size up,1
1751,The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back so it is so comfortable i agree with the previous review i am not thrilled about the hook and eye but it still looks cute with a tank under it i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white it looks great with skinny jeans or pants,1
1752,I ordered these culottes because they looked comfortable yet elegant they are indeed both,1
1753,This vest is not only stylish and beautiful it also has pretty specks of blue and rust and other colors will go with so much i love the collar not too big not too small just right frames the face nicely can wear with dresses can wear with skirts can wear with jeans can wear with cords the list is endless this will make any outfit look pulled together the accompanying belt or sash hits at hip level i personally like it more at waist level so i remove the belt and wear without it f,1
1754,This top is gorgeous and beautifully made however the fit leaves a lot to be desired the other parts of the straps pucker out and do not lay flat on your skin i tried to make this work but just couldnt so its going back,0
1755,Ok this shirt is like my dream its large comfy but sexy with the back dip as a larger chested lady g i really appreciate having a tee that i can easily throw on and look put together clearly this is a larger styled swing tee but its one of my favorites paired with a cute pair of boots and easily worn with a jacket it can tend to fall off the shoulders so id size down ill probably pick up the grey too,1
1756,I ordered these joggers in holly size m for reference i am lbs i have a small waist with thicker thighs and bum i was worried that these would make all my flaws stand out as so many joggers in the past have but these are not that way at all they are so comfy and just right they could easily be dressed up or down these joggers could quickly replace your everyday jeans or black leggings habit to add a new more stylish twist,1
1757,Very flattering fits tts love the colors does not give any lift up or support to breastsi am a c and i was fine with this it is so flattering to back and overall a flattering fit i was ok with my breast not being supported and uplifted if you want support this is not for you it does look exactly as it does on model in regard to coverage showing some cleavage but very little i am lbs and not very fit and took a medium my husband really loves this suit and gave it two big thum,1
1758,This is a perfect late summer into fall top you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeansbooties for the fall its slightly on the roomy side i am usually a medium and i had room but i think thats just the structure of the shirt off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place,1
1759,Love these pants very flattering not much stretch the rear waist band is elastic with minimal stretch and not visible to others they are long but wearable with the right heels,1
1760,I got this top in white and absolutely love it the top can be tucked in or worn out it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans cant wait to wear it,1
1761,I bought this top in black and it fits my body type really well it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently the black top is really slimming and is a great cut i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me but this top is definitely a great length,1
1762,I love this jacket and the price was a great bonus it fit perfectly and is nice cozy and warm well made and the beige color is great,1
1763,Beautiful dress not lined but the fabric is sturdy enough i do prefer a slip under but that is my preference for most things great for dressing up or down so comfortable,1
1764,Love this blazer combines a chic pulled together look with super soft comfortable material will be great for the office and the weekend runs a little bigam typically a large or xl so i ordered the xl and had to exchange for a large might have actually been able to size down to a medium but didnt want to deal with the back and forth again,1
1765,Love this piece lots of versatility and the pattern is lovely wear it alone or with leggings and boots,1
1766,I adore this top the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt thats been worn for years it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders it still works and looks just fine im broad in the shoulders and well endowed but the large was perfect,1
1767,I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the off dresses promotion a few months ago i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it but hemmed and hawed at the original price it was a splurge even at off but as soon as i put it on i was in love this dress is so soft i wore it to see some old friends and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was the material is thick enough to have a decen,1
1768,A perfect goto top looks great with jeans dark faded or bright white top it with a cardigan or wear it bare it offers a flattering fit with its highquality textured fabric i normally wear a small or medium top an extrasmall fits me perfectly,1
1769,I was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering whatwasithinking when you try it on later when i bought this once i tried this on at home i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing theres so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back i wanted to love t,0
1770,I actually like the fit but i guess it depends on your overall body type i too ordered a small and medium i actually could fit the small but preferred the room in the medium the movement on these are spectacular and the material is light and cool,1
1771,I loved the contrast of the front panels and sleevesback of this sweater it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed but overall this is a lovely sweater,1
1772,I love this top i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price great quality unique and great fit i look forward to wearing it all year,1
1773,Great petite maxi im and it skims the top of my feet soft fits great and went right into my suitcase for my upcoming trip can dress up or down,1
1774,This coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the madeline stories she just got her first paid internship in the city so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate after all a girl has to make a good first impression,1
1775,This sweater is such a cozy knitted dream the mixed knit contrast trimhood adds enough visual interest to keep it unique from other incarnations out there its a little open work but still snuggly warm with layers the fit is very roomy but not sloppy looking thats why i picked runs large as youd have to size down for a somewhat slimmer look if i could afford to buy the other color now i would i wish retailer would commission a green version and a brown version red too what the heck,1
1776,It looks adorable in the picture but just not flattering in real life too much fabric in the skirt that flares from the waist in a bunchy unflattering way makes a slender but curvy figure look boxy rather than enhancing curves its a pass love the blue print though,0
1777,I want to be the person who lounges like the modelbut this was huge and more woolfeeling than the lightweight shawl i was hoping for i am an got the xss it was the right sizei returned it,0
1778,I saw this on one of the gals at my local retailer and fell in love it is the coolest bomber and i instantly fell for it i went with my normal l and i will be wearing this all fall and winter long its just so unique and eye catching,1
1779,I am in love with this piece i am long waisted and large busted so finding a jumpsuit to fit me can be challenging having said that i sized up when ordering this wrong ladiesno needi had to reorder my normal size and even that was roomy but in a good way as i prefer belting it with my huge concho belts i purchased it in the rasberry and i am still scratching my head as to why the black sold first the red is stunning and i find it more versatile going from casual to dressy and this,1
1780,I ordered this dress and loved loved it beautiful great fabric the length was even perfect for me and im i am usually a size but ordered up to a because i am a little woman with the exception of my chest i have ordered dresses before from retailer where i had to order certain dresses a size larger and they worked unfortunately this time it wasnt to be tried the dress on and it fit nicely until the side zipper got to my chest area i would have ordered another size lar,1
1781,Stunning cardigani love it they only had a size l on sale so i purchasedim so glad i did could have gone with a m though maybe even a s but that would be cutting it especially since im ft in lbs compliments keep coming and such a great piece to have in my closet,1
1782,Found this jumpsuit in standard size smallred motif pictures dont do it justice instore and to my surprise it actually fit of course it was billowy since im short lbs and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet which i dont mind i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest areanear my armpitslike normal women usually have ladi,1
1783,This is just a really fun jacket agreed with the previous reviewer that its not the most functional but guess what this is super cozy its lined with the softest faux fur its quilted in an army green and it has the best trim along the arm they couldve cut corners on the quality here for instance with the beading or the material on the trim however they didnt cut those corners instead the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive cant wait till the weather g,1
1784,I love this top yes it is quite transparent but just needs a light colored cami i like the reversible scoop and vneck tanks at retailer its incredibly soft and light for summer time the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern i also really like the sewn in vneck line it gives the shirt a more professional touch ill be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer,1
1785,Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on especially over dresses but also anything it drapes beautifully and i love the button closure detail it is definitely a thin soft lightweight knit but i think that makes it practical for yearround use much like other items by bordeaux,1
1786,The online picture does not do this skirt justice its very pretty and unique in design i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture this is truly a pretty pencil skirt,1
1787,I am years old and enjoy retailer so much for uniquenessthis dress is not flattering in the photobutit is great on a curvy figure and i plan to wear it anywhereeverywhere i canso flatteringfrom the bust to the smaller waist though mine is definitely not small but the skirt thenflares deligthfully the fabric is not heavy not too light just greateasy going lengthwear as is or add a crop belt etcagain the photo does not do this dress justice,1

1789,This top arrived by mail this morning it is beautiful even prettier than the picture fits true to size and is wonderful quality cannot wait to wear it when i leave on vacation this weekend,1
1790,This dress is very versatile it is comfortable and very flattering the armholes were not too big you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show i purchased the redpink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches it accentuates the best part of the leg it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes it is a classic style not trendy so it wi,1
1791,I love lace dresses and this one is no exception great construction and color i paired the dress with a plum colored blazer and i really was pleased at how well it all went together im about and im normally an or at retailer my fits great and is not tight at all so im thinking it may run a tad bit big,1
1792,This twist front top fits true to size it is perfect i really love the ruched sides i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy this one is perfect it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navyperiwinkle and they are so cute together cant wait to hit the beach,1
1793,Love this sweater very soft and can be dressy or casual,1
1794,I want to wear this skirt every day its so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing itcan dress it up or down its pretty darn fabulousi highly recommend it youll be grateful and feel pretty,1
1795,Very comfortable nightgown love that it had pockets fit is as expected,1
1796,I bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer even though i am normally a smallsize at lbs i opted for the because i am busty d this was the right call the dress is comfortable flattering and i got lots of compliments its a keeper,1
1797,Love the detail quality of make and fabric comfort ive been looking for a top like this expect that it will wash fine its not see through and i always wear a nude bra got xs in white and it fits well not too loose and billowy im highly recommend,1
1798,Great lightweight pants for summer size down the length is slightly long and they stretch out throughout the day im normally a in pilcro and took a large in these so cute,1
1799,I just love everything about these jeans and everyone that sees them on me seems to as well im short and was concerned about the length on me because they didnt have the petite in my size but these seem to be just fine i wear them with a bit of a heel so that helps they fit snugly but not too tight in all the right places i have a bit of a backside so thats a plus for me because of the higher waist they also dont ride down except for the shorter length they remind me a l,1
1800,I tried this top on before it went on sale but thought the price was too high as soon as it went on sale i scooped it up and im glad i did im usually always a small in retailer tops and this was no exception im tall and thin with a large bust but this top does not pull or bind in the chest because its cut on the bias it is a little low but ive been wearing it for parties it might be too low for work depending on the setting i dont usually wear green but this is a very muted and pretty,1
1801,This jacket fits great i got a medium and am lbs very nice light weight jacket,1
1802,Super soft fabric however very short in the stride i ordered an xl normally wear i had to return it,0
1803,Timeless skirt just dont like the placement of the slit so maybe ill sew it up,1
1804,Im in love with these jeans they come very long but its easy to cut them down where you want them since they are not hemmed i have a short torso so for me they were high waisted but still flattering which surprised me for reference i am and i got the size,1
1805,Many complements today at work comfortable even on days you dont want to wear something form fitting,1
1806,The pattern and fabric are lovely but the sleeves are short unlike the photo so it drapes very strangely i personally could not figure out how to wear it so that it looked anything remotely like the photo had to return this one,0
1807,Marking down one star because these pants do gape quite a bit when you sit down though i appreciate the shorts underneath that prevent any indecent exposure these could have done with a little stitch in the front or side somewhere on the leg to limit that that said my other similar nonretailer pants that are much worse and are also are bulkier on top which does not look great at my sizewith my body shape these are more flattering i love the band on top and comfortable i am normally a,1
1808,This is such a pretty top i do not feel it runs big as another review mentioned to fit the sleeves comfortably i do not have large arms at all i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model a bit more of a tunic fit on me it is really a pretty top either way the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do,1
1809,Hate i have to return it way too longalmost more mid thighalmost dress length,0
1810,Sticker price was a shock but it is so worth it it is the best little black dress i have ever owned the lace is so soft and the dress is flattering it is fun and flirty this is a closet staple piece for sure love this dress so much,1
1811,Absolutely love this top yes it runs big and is flowy but i think it is very flattering especially with skinny jeans loved it so much i bought the navy and wine colors for myself and the green for my mom for reference im lbs and the xs fit well falls just above my mid thigh,1
1812,Ordered this dress in an xs that is the size i usually wear this runs small but not only that it is the way it is cut very small through the hips thighs and legs hard to walk in it the material felt kind of cheap to me i thought it looked really good on the model but got it home and didnt like it at all it went back,0
1813,While i love the fabric and the pattern this skirt leaves too much to be desired the full price is absurd considering what you getthere is no mention online that there is no built in slip and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must see attached photo even in dim lighting you can see straight through also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is pullon styling i would say that it is true to size and i am usually a medium retailer but i have a sm,0
1814,I read the rave reviews but tried this on with low expectations i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges the dress was the exact opposite so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down i am lbs and a small fit perfectly i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today,1
1815,Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets,1
1816,I tried this one as a xs and xs petite and of course the petite is the way to go for me length slightly below around the knee if i pull on the straps then the hem hits the knees i wish the blue was still available in petite now that it is on sale the waist is adjustableand so are the straps the material is airy like linen pretty and flirty and appropriate for work cant go wrong lbs dd in waist,1
1817,I am normally between a size and so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work the seemed pretty tight all around so i returned the and kept the even though there was a little bit of room in the waist of course the size after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out was bagging in the crotch area sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o,0
1818,I wasnt sure about this dress when i ordered it online but thought i would give it a try i am ordered an xs and thought i may be too short to pull something like this off and that it might look like a moomoo or maternity dress on me but i absolutely love it my husband does toovery sexy and lowkey i wore it for the first time today and received compliments within an hour this is going to be one of my favorites,1
1819,This top is beautiful in both colors it was a difficult decision at the store i went with the black and my usual size s fit well with a little room but in no way overly baggy i tried on the xs which also fit but was a little constricting the quality is excellent and i highly recommend this top question i have however is that the online description says machine wash however my tag states dry clean only just curious if anyone has hand washed this yet otherwise it is a beautiful comf,1
1820,I saw this dress online and loved it i ordered the blue denim one in my usual sizes an and but i think the was sized wrong anyhow both were too small so when i returned them they were in the store i ended up with a size which fits great with a little bit of room it is light weight simple but fun and very comfortable to wear i have received many compliments on it on my first day wearing it i also ordered it in white thinking that i might prefer that color but when it arri,1

1824,This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable i am and usually wear but the fit me love love love this dress,1
1825,This is a great top soft and cozy fabric nice and sturdy feeling its heavier than i though itd be so its perfect for the cooler days of spring and even a chilly summer night i love that its long enough in the front for me to feel comfortable wearing leggings the body is nice and roomy but the arms are a little snug however i like that because i think it makes it look less like a slubby sweatshirt the best part it can be cleaned in the washer and drier thrilled with this purchase,1
1826,One of the best tops i have ever bought i love he material and the style the satin trim around the edges adds a classy touch i wore this top with yoga pants and then with jeans and it was perfect for both outfits the shirt is true to size i wear a size small and it fit perfectly lbs b,1
1827,The fitted high waist with the wide legs make for a flattering and comfortable short perfect length as well dress up or down love these shorts and wish there were more colors,1
1828,I just couldnt resist the western scene and it doesnt disappoint i ordered size large and although its a bit long for me it flows nicely over my hips i had to try it on with several different bottoms and find it looks great with shorts and skinny or boyfriend jeans just darling under a jean jacket and cardigan too the fabric isnt thin or heavy wasnt it goldilicks who said its just right i love the uniqueness of the print that is just edgy and different enough to translate to great,1
1829,I was worried this sweater would be too tight but it has a very flattering fit i am a librarian and this sweater makes me feel like a quirky librarian i love it,1
1830,Exactly as pictured great fit love it,1
1831,This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect when i got it it looked like a big box and didnt fit anywhere the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge i got a small based on other reviews but it was way too big sadly i had to return it,0
1832,What a beautiful harbinger of spring this blouse is so lovely and uplifting for me tts i bought the size b and it fits perfectly this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so i understand why some say size up the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse the fabric is soft but not overly sheer,1
1833,I love this shirt i bought the ivory color its incredibly comfortable and an easy style,1
1834,I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat i admired this soon as it appeared hesitant to purchase without any reviews nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance i love the pattern burgundy wine faux fur collar the fit colors are true i sized up which i recommend glad i did this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate length midknee imo not worth full price eleveness does design pretty coats,1
1835,Beautiful dress flowing but not too much volume not too short but not dowdy gorgeous deep jade color with chartreuse accents flattering waist not sure why the model is covering that part up but its a nice waist with a tie belt i think it looks really smashing in person not too formal perfect for a daytime event like a bridal shower,1
1836,Id been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online so when it went on sale i ordered it right away well i was thoroughly disappointed i agree with some of the other reviewers the fit is odd huge on top and too snug on the bottom being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didnt hang well on my curvy body being too loose in some areas and too snug in others also the top is embroidered while the bottom isnt the material is thin and and it definitely isnt high enoug,0
1837,I love everything about this dress i love the colors style and fit it is so comfortable i had so many people ask where i got it i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect,1
1838,I got this version in the black and white and cant wait to wear it it is very flattering on and will look great for those springsummer events the only thing that could have made this dress better would be side pockets like the fallwinter navy dress by the same designer had but dont let that minor detail hold you back,1
1839,Love this i adore pilcro great for us gals who have thick hips thighs and a slim waist they fit tts and are a great staple for fall the color says dark orange but they are as pictured a perfect dark tan i wish that retailer would buy more size in all pilcro they always sell out fast and i am always out of luck unless i find them when they first come out also please make a full length boyfriend jean pilcro love,1
1840,This is a darling dress at this price point i tried some of the more expensive options in the offtheshoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others the fabric is light but it is not sheer it is smooth with a bit of a sheen it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be i would describe it as a lawn upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a coverup the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat,1
1841,Tried it on at the store must of been a return at first i wasnt thrilled with this dress have a little bit of a pouch and would never think i could wear a tight dress like this the cut was perfect for that imperfect belly went to a hour dinner that night and was so comfortable not itchy and i felt very pretty in it husband loved it and was happy for me to show my curves again would not of ordered this online so glad it was in store much more vibrant in person try it you will lik,1

1843,I was running low on good summer shorts and thought id try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago i tried these shorts on instore to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online more colors were available in my size than what they had in store i bought these in different colors and i absolutely love them all they are my goto shorts now they look good with the legs rolled up or down and i will be wear,1
1844,This is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts it is wide but has a lovely flowswing to it love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top,1
1845,Excellent dress usually i wear a oop and this did fit great a little snug in the chest im a c but the buttons are covered by material so it doesnt show the waist hits perfectly there is the right amount of skirt material to make a dramatic silhouette without looking silly awesome dress wish the blue or white with icecream were still available the hot pink is a wonderful summer color though,1
1846,The dress looks great both in winter and summer either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own it runs true to sizewas able to buy it online the fabric is great for all day weardoesnt wrinkle too muchthe only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste but i still love the dress,1

1848,Let me talk about the fit i am a size petite i weigh and am tall i am curvy and have short legs what little height i have is in my torso that being said i ordered the p and the no doubt about it the p fits like a p the p was tight in the hips and thighs the size regular was a perfect fit if you want the pant to have s cropped look like in the picture then order up a size and stay in petite so i would have ordered a p id i wanted the cropped look like in the pic bu,1
1849,Great top love the fit it pairs great with dark denim and pearls i ordered a and am a c cup and waist,1
1850,Love this shirt i love florals so the bright pretty yellow just had to be mine it is true to size perfect neckline not too low or high and very flattering see through enough to require a cami but worth it very soft fabric and really comfy,1
1851,Totally out of my style range but am totally enamored by this tent dressshirtcoat thing ok so yes its very very tenty but fits on my shoulders size down x or x if youre narrow shouldered and i use one of my leather belts to gather the material and make myself a nice western fit flare like the model shots this looks great with a tee and skinnies if you have tried the marvelous silk santee swing dress the escalante has the same amount of fabric that reviewer either love or hate i,1
1852,This top is true to size for me im lbs and i ordered both a size and the six was too big i could tell because the shoulder seem was in the wrong spot and i couldnt lift my arms the shoulder seem hung too low the was perfect i had full range of motion for my arms and was easily able to bend down and touch my toes without any pulling on the buttons of the shirt i always order a small or size in tops the bigger size didnt add any length in front just added a boxier feel,1
1853,Beautiful design and perfect for warm days it has a lovely open back with the perfect amount of loose fitting flow,1
1854,Per reviews and from looking at retailer employee pics on instagram i sized down to a small cinched with a wide leather belt topped with a cropped jacket added some shooties and a necklace when winter comes this will go with my knee high suede boots long wool coat and chunky scarf this does not look like a table runner on me like the model shot and previous reviews imply now i am tempted to buy the other color im d and purchased red melange in size s,1
1855,Saw this top online and hoped for the best my hopes were rewarded lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also i asked friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments,1
1856,I purchased these bottoms with the matching peplum top in romantic floral i also purchased the higher waisted bottoms just in case i returned the higher bottoms and thats saying a lot i have two sons and now struggle with fit in regard to two piece bathing suits the higher bottoms just didnt fit right and i didnt need the extra coverage because these fit so well and the peplum gives extra coverage though not really necessary the others cut in a bit in the seat and hips and these,1
1857,Love the short in the front long in the back look it has an almost glittery look really roomy i would size down really comfy and pretty,1
1858,Its a cute idea but its so low cut and the material is very thin i was hoping to wear it as a cool flowing summer top but ill have to layer it since my whole bra basically hangs out of it im only keeping it because it was such a good price also the buttons are super tiny and a little hard to fasten,0
1859,I often find wearing anything described as slim difficult but these pants are absolutely wonderful i bought in a size regular length they are perfect both in fit and quality,1
1860,Comfortable relaxed fit i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well,1
1861,Beautiful feminine flowy dress love the brass button detail at neckline and around waistgives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of edge had to detach the slip to get it on but glad it is included with the dress i purchased the small and fits like a glove lbs d cant wait to wear it,1
1862,This shirt is made of a thicker material so you are able to wear it through multiple seasons i also liked that it is a bit longer however it runs a little large so i would order a size down if possible,1
1863,I already have one pair of sleep pants by retailer and was looking for a second pair i wanted something warm and comfortable for the fall and upcoming winter weather i live in the rockies as soon as i saw the woodland animal print on these pants i had to try them i mean seriously how cute are the raccoons and other critters here when they arrived at first i thought they might be too thin for winter wear but when i put them on i was pleasantly surprised by the soft comfy fabric i,1
1864,Ordered two of these and they fit great and will be perfect for layering true to size fit cute detail in the back for a racer tank,1
1865,Im not a blazer girl but this one is perfect in the sense that its not overly structured and stiff it is really soft and comfortable but still holds its shape i am planning to wear it with a tee shirt and denim or even some leather leggings pilcroi can see this being dressed up for work or church a great piece for your wardrobe i could have taken a small but decided on the medium in case i wore something a little thicker underneath,1
1866,Tried this on at my local retailer the red color is pretty but not a true red the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days two big problems though the top is very low cut and i could see it opening up to the world and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra this is a dealbreaker for me it cant be fixed,0
1867,I received this top yesterday and love it sexy yet not too revealing and great for date night i like the way it fits across the chest and isnt too short in the waist very soft fabric,1
1868,The perfect striped tshirt and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different i love it,1
1869,Perfect for the weekend purchased the purple it is a nice soft purple great with jeans xs petite was perfect lbs,1
1870,I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure it is longer as it appears on the model i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price,1
1871,I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on and i was majorly disappointed it was incredibly unflattering in every way as a few of the other reviewers mentioned if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant im and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer but thisewww i will say the color and material are gorgeous but im guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes,0
1872,This blouse is gorgeous first of all its cotton so it is extremely comfortable it isnt tighter in some areas more than others but fits evenly throughout which although a rarity is wonderful finally a blouse that fits perfectly i am and pounds i ordered the regular xs and it hits right at my hips i have a longer torso however so although i am not tall the petite would have been too short for me it is beautifully made and the red is a beautiful crimson on white grab th,1
1873,Beautiful well made and styled dress perfect for company christmas parties where you want to look nice but not show too much cleavage i wear it with a cameo brooch,1
1874,I tried on the usual xs in the patterned style and it fit really nicely the colors are very nice in person vibrant teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing the sleeves flutter out and will give a bit more volume if i would change something that would be it i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter i am lbs for reference,1
1875,This dress is amazing it fits true to size very flattering and the fabric is beautifuli am and it felt a little long for me so i am having it hemmed up one inch but others may like the hemline just as it is i like my dresses just right above my knee and it was hitting in the middle of my kneejust love everything about it and would definitely recommend it highly,1
1876,I usually wear size but the was perfect would have definitely been loose really nice zipper in the back this skirt is thick and has a stiffbouncy construction to it due to the neoprene which i was worried would make me look large but it is still soft enough that it doesnt do that i usually have to get petite for retailer and this was no exception the nonpetite goes beyond my knees awkwardlystrangely enough my only criticism for this is that the outer shell seems to get largish w,1
1877,I love this jacket it is super soft and a gorgeous color i can wear it with jeans and a tee or dress it up and wear it to work so versatile a must have for the fall season,1
1878,I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women it is so comfortable and cute i never want to take it off p,1
1879,I bought this coat years ago and every fallwinter i cant wait to wear it again cant even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn but i just might be tempted to buy it again which is something i have never done with a statement piece the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it,1
1880,I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it the picture does not do it justice it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality fabric is very soft and light weight highly recommend,1
1881,I love this piece like another reviewer i did notice a broken button right out of the package but it was so great in every other way that im going to keep it and have that mended and the buttons reinforcedim generally a size medium small frame on top but baby growing hips i found it tts,1
1882,Love the design and colorsruns a but large through the middle,1
1883,Got these on saleabsolutely love eberjey fabric is super soft and easy to wash more normal than other eberjey styles not lingerie im lbs and small fit well i am small busted and there is definitely extra room but doesnt make it fit weird at all highly recommend,1
1884,Love the fit and color of this top i love that it is somewhat fitted around the arm holes which doesnt allow for extra skin to show it drapes nicely over my hips and tummy got rave reviews from my husband,1
1885,I am so pleased with this tunic the fabric heavy enough to wear through winter and it is very flattering the colors are as pictured as well as another reviewer mentioned the slit is high but it still works perfectly with leggings or mid to high rise skinny jeans,1
1886,I love jeans especially this pair perfect fit hugs in all the right places perfect length worn it x already and it gets better every time you wear it goes great with a cute too,1
1887,This is a great top to pair with jeans to step a casual night up a notch,1
1888,I generally dont write bad reviews but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost the design and colors are great but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturers tag is at the back of the neck the material is very thin so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment i shop at retailer all the time and this is not a item of clothing,0
1889,Great rather heavyweight long cardi i purchased the blue which is a lovely shade of grayblue not quite as bright as the picture depicts pin is adorable doubt ill ever use it to close the sweater but still a nice touch for reference im lbs ddd and typically fall between size small and medium took a medium in this one and glad i did perfect fit falls exactly like on the model,1
1890,The model pose does not do this dress justice it is super flattering and the fabric is a thick light fabric cant explain it the pattern is simply adorable i cant figure out why this one is on sale while other colors arent as in my opinion this is the nicest onefits true to size as in my lower range i tried on both pettie and regular and went with regular petite was too short for me i went with size and am and weight about,1

1893,I was looking for a basic black one piece suit that sucked in the tummy but with style and a little flair this is it the ruching is perfect the material is great and the separation of the straps at the top give it more style i am usually a size but ordered an because i have a d chest i was right on the covers the top with a small amount of cleavage and the bottom still fits because the ruching is a little tighter in the waist i plan to wear this to the local pools this summer an,1

1895,For years ive eyed these printed pilcro cord leggings every single year in every single incredibly cool print ive always wanted them finally i decided to try them on after we got this green and navy print and im so glad i did these are dreamy they are so stretchy and so comfortable they hold snug against your leg for a very streamlined fit but plenty of stretch so movement is no issue the print is my favorite part the colors are extremely fun but still classy enough to not feel to,1
1896,I love this tunic the natural color is just that this is a tunic so the fit is a little large i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top,1

1904,I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didnt prepare me for the sweaters issues it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back seriously heartbroken,0
1905,I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored its very cute and on trend cant wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans,1

1908,I love this dress it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath,1
1909,I absolutely love this jacket its one of the best things ive bought this season the interior is so unbelievably soft i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin the fit is beautiful as is the pattern its even better in person than in the photo it is pricey but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it its well worth it,1
1910,I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on comfortable beautiful fabric cute gold buttons as well due to the cut it feels roomy but has a slender fit around the arms the denim color has beautiful detail but i dont think i would like the maroon solid i wish there was another nonsolid color i would buy another one,1
1911,This is a beautiful sweater its very lightweight and sheer so best to wear a tank or camisole underneath also better for warmer months i ordered the light aqua color and its lovely,1

1915,These capri length pants are awesome i do recommend sizing down though as the l was really big on me i am a with most of my weight in my rear so normally never size down in pantsthe fabric is really nice and the print is versatile and allows wonderfully for pattern mixing super comfortable,1
1916,I wasnt sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on this jacket totally worked for me the brown color can be easily matched with other colors i got the jacket in medium size i usually in between size the medium size allow more space on the chest area however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me,1
1917,Ok ladiesyou need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes i bought the white one it is super thin and lovely but i was only able to get two wears out of it i did wash it and it maintained its size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer,0

1920,Super cute no complaints fun print light weight soft material,1
1921,This jacket is far more attractive than on the website i would have passed this up had i not seen it in the store the embroidered sleeve detail is intricate with raised cream colored stitching surrounded by small brass beads on a rich olive green background blue detail sets this off as a unique statement piece that will surely draw compliments i am lbs and the extra small regular fit fine i considered a petite but the salesperson thought the longer length would look better so i w,1
1922,These jeans are adorable i wear a p and the petite fit perfectly great quality and will look cute with a boxy crop top and flats,1

1924,It is very cute i think actual one is much better than the picture,1
1925,I was initially attracted to the colors,1
1926,This dress is beautiful this is a and tts it was not clingy or tight at all lbs it is fully lined and i have short legs so it was not too short for me if you have an event you could wear this to this summer i highly recommend,1
1927,I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work its very comfortable and light,1
1928,I love this comfy top and if it couldnt get any better the pleated back makes it extra special it is easy to thrown on and still feel put together i purchased this top in the green and im absolutely enthralled by the rich color i do agree that the quality of the pleats could be slightly better however i believe its up to par with the price point i typically wear an xsxsp and ultimately decided to go with a small for a more oversized tunic top look but otherwise id go for your normal,1
1929,This is a wonderful dress i love the fit and feel of the fabric i have been looking for a while for a fall maxi to wear with a pair of free people boots i purchased this dress is perfect with them the colors are fall and fresh can i say that about fall,1

1931,This is a really nice quality dress it is a lowcut vneck but the fabric is form fitting so its not revealing when u move i love the top part of the dress but the skirt just did nothing for me its a soft material but the skirt almost resembles a bath towel in look and feel i am petite in size lbs i will be returning due to the skirt being to loose on me in width rather than length also the center pleat of the skirt makes it look a bit odd the skirt hit right at knee height,0
1932,Love this tank material and fit are great love that its reversible highly recommend,1
1933,So much extra fabric not something i would recommend buying online,0
1934,I bought this in the purple print the fabric is soft similar to silk looks great with black burgundy tan pantsskirts i find it comfortable and received compliments on it at worki have not washed yet cannot comment on washability,1
1935,The fabric felt cheap and i didnt find it to be a flattering top for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are,0
1936,The dress is beautiful in pictures but all the reviews are dead onit was full of snags when it arrived snags to be exact and the fabric was heavier than i expected sadly had to return,0
1937,I love this dress im lbs and have no hips no butt and no waist i have no curves and thin muscular legs its like wearing a cardigan and dress all in one i paired it with ivory tights and dark brown boots and received tons of compliments,1
1938,I thought this would look great with skirts but all my skirts are too dressy for this tshirt thats really all it is a nothingspecial tshirt and it runs so big im usually a large or xl in tops but for this one i bought a medium and its still too big i think a small would have been fine but as i mentioned it doesnt go with any of my skirts so its not worth looking for a small,0
1939,This top does run large im lbs and usually a medium i bought a small and probably could have gone xs that said i love this top its soft and comfy and swingy i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color,1
1940,I went with the xs because i didnt want the v neck in the front to be too low it looks cute paired with a kimono and a necklace,1
1941,Great little spring top the fabric is soft and the drape is of the fabric is just right it is very loose without making it look like a maternity top and the length hits me right at the top of the hipbone for reference i am in my s and weigh in thes i normally wear medium size and this one was no exception the blue is a beautiful cobalt color,1
1942,I love the fleetwood stylevery trendyfit like a dream very long for you leggy gals me i need to hem these would also look cute as cutoffs for us shortiestrue to size slim fit,1
1943,These culottes are beautiful really pretty cerise shade with a nice eyelet pattern they are only partially lined the size small my normal size was falling off of me so i sized down to extra small which fit perfectly,1

1945,Great top a little large but i shrank it a little in the wash and it fits a little better now i love the structure and pattern of this top as well as the lovely coralorange color it can be dressed up or dressed down love it,1
1946,This is the first romper i have have purchased and is so cute i am in between a small and a medium usually lbs and athletic the medium fit okay but with some extra fabricthe small fit better and was much more flattering the romper feel wellmade cant wait to wear it,1
1947,I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors im on the shorter side so in terms of length im able to wear them as regular jeans the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching this particular style is my absolute favorite although ag jeans are on the pricier side after i bought my first pair i was a convert as opposed to other brands i find that they are a worthwhile investment as other,1
1948,This sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater it runs tts however if you like the short length then id size down im d and the xs was perfect the sweater didnt feel too scratchy but its not a soft sweater very feminine,1
1949,Has to be one of my favorite retailer purchases the shirt is so soft and can be paired with so many different items the turtle neck will help keep you warm although the actual material is a little thin dont let that dissuade you though you wont be disappointed by this purchase im going to get the other color too,1
1950,This dress was returned to our store and i was intrigued the second i saw it the dress is definitely oversized so much so that you could probably size down a size or two but what i love about this dress is the style its meant to be oversizedand with the print the asymmetric cut and the oversized lookits very unique the color is exactly as it appears and the material is wonderful thin but soft and comfortablereally easy to wear you could do this as a dress or with leggings and b,1
1951,Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it lightweight looks great with boots,1
1952,I love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large really it just depends on how you want it to fit the length is great too about inches above my knee im foot which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit i got the,1
1953,I love deletta and regularly search for their items here on retailer however this one is a miss as i think it runs small or you need to be taller and thinner then i for the gathering opening to hit you right i did really like the color ordered the brown and material but back it goes,0
1954,With my hourglass frame wider hips and having a baby i wear normally sizes ml in most retailer skirts and dresses however with this i was able to fit into an it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking here are my thoughtspros lots of stretch and comfort pockets always a plus in my book will go with any top nice length fit me as in the model very slimming you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi,1
1955,I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric nice weight and hangs well definitely a keeper,1
1956,If youre looking for pretty and flowy this is it i frequently wear xs in retailer sizing but in this top i went with a s lbs a love the top but debating on keeping it because im not sure the yellow color looks great on my slightly olive skingreat with legging capris for summer,1
1957,Loved the idea of this unfortunately it disappointed all around its way too short and ran small the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece usually an retailer small lbs dd but ordered a medium small would not have fit in this piece do not recommend,0
1958,The first reviewer was right about this dresschecked her review before buying it its a beautiful creation and perfectly designed and its also slimming i was worried that the fit might be too tight in the skirt but it is fine highly recommended,1
1959,Regretfully this dress is on its way back for an exchange the dresss is beautiful and fits true to size i ordered it in both colors however the black has a defect in the lace right on the front of the dress and the white was tearing in a few spots under the arms and on the bottom again the dress is so pretty and i am hoping retailer will find me one without bunching pulls or tears for an exchange but i cant pay for a dress that is already torn,0
1960,Trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts never thought id find both in one top love this i put it on and knew i had to take it home its fitted but not busy but just enough so and its made in the usa cant go wrong,1
1961,Love love love this little lbdlots of rich detail and still very easy and laid back dress up or dress downi will be wearing this into the fall season i purchased the l still roomy tried the m but a little snug in the shoulders and chest i am usually a size d cup very flattering style boho chic,1
1962,These are gorgeous and not too short or too long which is oddly hard to find theyre mostly tts but if youre between sizes id go up a size because the small was slightly snug on me and im a im hopeful that theyll stretch a little with wear because i think the medium would be too loose,1
1963,Im a dd so i wouldnt normally wear a bralette out of the house not enough support this bralette is actually very supportive and comfortable im probably going to get at least one more for reference im a dd small back big boobs and a small fit me extremely well,1
1964,I just got this and couldnt wait to wear it to work today it is such a pretty designed top unfortunately it is falling apart as i write this review one sleeve is unraveling there are strings hanging off all over the lacy arms am so disappointed in the quality ill be sending it back when i get home,0
1965,This is a great top i love how its loose and hangs away from my body but is banded at the bottom so it isnt shapeless the tie at the neck is cute and gives it some personalityi usually bounce between a s or xs i tried the xs in the store but ordered the s,1
1966,I agree with all of the reviews the design and fit are wonderful if you can get it on the buttons are a nightmare whoever made these clesrly sewed the loopholes on the buttons closed with no thought as how to open them or get them off ridiculous they need to put a side zipper on this as i will probably check into since i really want to keep it so so so disappointing,0
1967,I wanted this skirt to work it is soft comfortable and cute unfortunately it runs to short i am and would not be able to pull it off at work i ordered a bigger size and it still didnt work,0
1968,I tied this on a whim thinking it was a big s on the hanger but it is so cute and hip i fell instantly in love the material is amazingly soft and generally doesnt wrinkle i wore it for my thesis presentation and it went flawlessly it has a very light lightgrey window pane print on it that looks great with grey pixie pants white pants and the blue is light enough you could even pair it with black bottoms and jeans a total catch and the fun layover in the back is just an added pop of,1
1969,I am a size and tall i was afraid that it would be too short the sales clerk grabbed a large and it fit its airy and lightweight and hugs nicely around the back the big surprise pockets love it,1
1970,Great fabric and nice cut like other reviewer said fitted but not toobut it was just too short for my legs i do wonder if the description is wrong but i didnt keep it long enough to measure and check this,1
1971,Love this bought in camel and cream in xs runs large cute with jeans thigh high boots leather skirt and booties or just casual so many compliments great for wearing a sweater but showing off arms,1
1972,Flattering fit true to size i ordered which fit perfectly i am lbs wish it came in off whitesand and black great with boots and more substantial than some leggings also extremely comfy,1
1973,This was my first choice as one piece suit after having babies the minute i put it on i just loved how confortable it felt and very flattering in all the right places the fabric is great im and lb i ordered a and it fits great,1
1974,Super cute and flow mine had a bit of stitching problem so i am exchanging it for the same thing fabric feels great def recommend,1
1975,I love the colors originally purchased a large for my broad shoulders and it was too big and too long for exchanged it for a petit medium and it fits great will have to wait for cooler days to wear it since it is a heavy cotton and the weather is still very hot intexas,1
1976,Love this top the length is perfect and it is very stylish hope it will come in other colors because i would buy more,1
1977,I was trying on the cream knit turtleneck midi dress in the store and wanted the shearling vest shown with it to work for me the dress is sleeveless very good looking on but the vest on me was too much looked like i was being swallowed by a huge shearling taco i wanted and needed something to stay warm in without the bulk of a full coat the stylist brought me this jacket and it was just the thing for me its classic and modern warm without bulk and the two tone complimented the dress a,1
1978,Beautiful maxi fits tts i normally wear a and took a it is flattering to the waist and makes me feel girly the colors are so beautiful and the length is good for my frame,1
1979,Loving this jumpsuit i normally a medium top small bottom i bought the medium it fits right soft fabric and nice color,1
1980,Again bought this while wearing my retailer colored glasses i loved the flowiness and color of the dark pink and was convinced in the dressing room that this top made me look like a chic goddess midvacation on the amalfi coast i tried it on at home and it straight up looked like i was wearing a maternity top since im not with child this ones going back,0
1981,Great comfortable dress with style this ran a little large so i returned for a medium so glad i did you can dress down with a pair of low sandals and sun hat or dress up with some heels and hair pulls back,1
1982,I purchased this dress in colorsbeautiful and so comfortable highly recommend,1
1983,This flared skirt caught my attention the first time it came up in the website i am more a florals and lace kind of girl but the flattering shape and stripes kept me going back to it agin and again i finally saw it in person at my store and needed to try it on perfect the colors are matte and not metallic as i thought based on the website photo you can definitely dress it down with a chambray too or t shirt i wore it to a work meeting and cant wait to wear it again its a bit on th,1
1984,I didnt realize that there were sequins on the design they kept poking my shoulders and made the top very uncomfortable the white material was also not very flattering on me it went back,0
1985,I had my eye on the umbrella print shirt for a while i was able to scoop it at a small discount i typically get a in maeve tops but per the reviews i got a i definitely could have done with a but ill probably stay with what i have adorable print comfortable well made,1
1986,I was looking for a romper for a long time which i dont need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax because of its design with a line on the top no worries for a relaxed romper the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight,1
1987,This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season the style with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side wont have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric its warm without being bulky and to top it off it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone extraordinary to say the least,1
1988,Best dress ever maeve does it again tts and can be worn all seasons here in sacramento love it and can be worn with a denim jacket or cardigan,1
1989,I love the teal color of this tshirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful however the top is way too large i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops so i ordered the size s there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top i know if i order an xs i will have the same problem below the bust the top is not flattering and itamps a shame,0
1990,I love this dress but unfortunately it is so low plunge that i would have no occasion to use this dress except for possibly a poolside eventi am a modest c cup and could not get away with wearing this dress anywhereif you do decide to purchase the dress you can actually go a size down im between a and and purchased the and fits beautifully,1
1991,This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller i love it the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top tts got my usual in green,1
1992,I loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape i was frustrated that it didnt have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head the fabric was stiff and seemed to be lace over cotton not entirely sure i couldnt get past the feeling off the material,0
1993,I cant tell you how many compliments i get on this gorgeous sweaterponcho there are tiny glimmery threads woven into it that make it so fun for dressing up i wore it to a fall holiday party and it was perfect its a little on the itchy side but the shirt i wore underneath solved the problem the colors are so gorgeous deep and rich love this piece,1
1994,This is beautiful it can serve as a sweater or a coat and i cant wait to start wearing it,1
1995,I love the idea of this top but wish there wasnt so much fabric i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are,0
1996,I love this shirt i have it in black and purple i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace you cant go wrong with a cute long sleeve shirt that is soft i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelmingit is more fitted than last years style,1
1997,I had been looking at this dress online hoping for a popback and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size i found the colors and print a bit blah i felt like it could use a little detail for the pricebead detail or embroidery in real life and i didnt love the fabric in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and doesnt drape particularly well things got worse in the dressing roomit was a disaster on me im busty and while the top fit because,0
1998,Like most people here i wanted this beautiful dress to fit so i decided to see for myself if maybe just maybe the negative reviews were wrong they werent if you have any sort of breasts at all the top probably wont fit properly i imagine a narrow upper torso like a or possibly a might find the top part of the dress closes properly but with a c i could not get a size to button up the waist hit at a strange spot and despite the picture showing a narrow waist and grad,0
1999,I am usually a in maeve tops but i sized up to a i am lbs it is a crisp white comfortable easy to wear tank that requires some ironing or steaming it doesnt look like much in the photo but once i saw it in person and tried it on it was an easy decision to make the purchase it is feminine and has a pronounced aline shape to it,1
2000,I saw this shirt and new that i had to have it i love the tassel on the back at the tie the fabric is not too sheer the fit is loose and will be cool this summer,1
2001,I like the laceup trend but most designs are too revealing this shirt is super sexy but not immodest i bought it in black and am now buying another color to me the fabric feels soft and thick very nice,1
2002,Could not let it pass at a sale price got the p and its a bit snug on the waist waist a lbs otherwise its perfect will keep the size dress hits me just above knee like in the picture its beautiful in person the details the quality the flattering fitperfect,1
2003,I wanted to love this dress as the length cut and color are exactly what ive been looking for but i was terribly disappointed in how thin and see through the material is,0
2004,I usually dont even consider this style of shirt but i was intrigued by its soft fabric and texture honestly i love this shirt it is so flattering and a perfect staple for any closet i can wait to wear it out and about,1
2005,I ordered this after reading through the reviews i realize the reviews were mixed but thought id take a chance unfortunately there were more things wrong than right with this dress right i loved the various colors yes it shows black but is actually brown i also loved that it was lined and the lining was semiattached to the dress with the same hitolow hemline wrong as said by others the sleeves were very tight the dress is roomy and does swing but unlike the model it isnt real,0
2006,I ordered this last week and received it yesterday and have to say it is a lovely dress the fabric is light but looks quite rich making one want to touch the textile the dress pattern reminds me of a missoni oh the dress is lined i purchased the blue pattern and am planning on wearing it to work on friday,1
2007,I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste i am tall slimathletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size they have some give and tend to get looser while you wear them but because they are midrise they wont slide down they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me the demin is solid the color a nice medium dark sky blue the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up,1
2008,I was really excited after finding this top online and reading the reviews the combination of peplum cap sleeves and color seemed too good to be true i ordered a size medium but unfortunately this top is on the short side so wearing it with pants or jeans did not work out in addition the fabric was more sheer than it looks in the picture and the vneck in front dipped a little lower too a camisole might have solved both of those problems but i didnt bother i returned it to the store,0
2009,I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape after hand washing in cold water and air drying as per instructions on the tag the shirt shrunk significantly so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all it also lost its shape and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering i wont be wearing it and am disappointed i didnt even get to wear it once,0
2010,Youve probably read through the other reviews so ill try not to repeat too muchpros it is lightweight and flows beautifully flattering every sort of shape and frame the leather circles throughout are darling and seem to be fairly secure some of mine were a bit bent upon receipt the color is subtle yet not understated it just works not sheer lining throughout that isnt itchy and some tulle on top of the lining to give it a bounce and fuller shape color is more t,1
2011,Nice and colorful dress but runs very oversized material mutes the colors not as vibrant in person,0
2012,Color of the dress matches color on my monitor the neckline is sheer i am lbs d and ordered a size i thought it fit perfect this is a great springsummer dress and can be worn with dress heels or flats for a dressier look it can also be worm with tennis shoes white converse are my choice for a more casual looki think this dress could also transition to a fallwinter piece paired with tights and a suit jacket or cardigan also i love the pockets though i do see ho,1

2019,I love this jacket its easy to dress up or be casual the black is more like a very dark grey,1
2020,Could not wait for this to come and so disappointed first of all its not a happy orange it a darker rust second it is huge fits in the shoulders and is super comfy and cute but would be a dynamite maternity top you could go to term in this blouse back it goes so sad,0

2024,As other reviewers have said this is the perfect summer maxi dress im tall just under feet and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height i do wish the skirt was lined but other than that the dress is excellent worth buying at full price if youre worried about it selling out,1

2026,Beautiful flattering dress love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing very happy with purchase highly recommend,1

2029,Love this dressfabric is very soft and flattering i paired it with wine suede boots great material i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine great go to dress,1
2030,Perfect wanted a dress for a mexican vacation this fits the bill exactly fabric has enough weight to hang well and cover any flaws love,1
2031,I have three pairs of these in different colors one pair is striped and i love them they are flattering and comfy they go with nearly everything cant get enough,1
2032,Runs very large ordered a smaller size due to other reviews but should have ordered several sizes smaller,0
2033,I popped into retailer the other day just to look around and saw this dress the fabric stood out first then i saw the cut and style and fell in love they only had xs and s and im usually a m because of my chest d but it looked so voluminous i thought id try it on the s fit perfectly the bodice fit a bit more closely and the rest of the dress flowed beautifully beneath it the sleeves are quite large but its kind of a fun look and feel its got a very peasant princess feel to,1
2034,This oversized coat is fabulous ive received so many compliments on it,1
2035,This dress has a charming carefree look that invites fall,1
2036,Beautiful skort true to size and very comfortable the actual shorts part of the skort is a nice modest length they have the appearance of a skirt with the utility and feel of a nice pair of shorts i cant wait to wear it again i am very pleased with my purchase,1
2037,Loved this dress online but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie,0
2038,I loved this dress after seeing it onlineit is a pullover dress and is easy to get on my major problem with the dress is that the waist is extremely high about inches over my natural waist and i usually have no problem with the placement of the waist in dresses im going to keep the dress because i like everything else about it the fit is flattering and the dress will be seasonless here in california ill search for a wide belt to cover the waistline or perhaps skip a belt altogether,1
2039,This fits so perfect it is light fabric not clingy very flattering i am lbs with athletic build,1
2040,First time trying pilcro but glad i did these shorts are extremely soft and comfortable without being too short love love,1
2041,Just a ginormous shapeless shirt runs extremely large i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small,0
2042,Clothes generally tend to look great when youre svelte hence thin models ive recently put on a few pounds normally a xs small in retailer and i have boobs and when i get lazy and eat a little too much i get it around the middle i already have a chest so that makes finding clothes to look flattering harder bc the boobs create the apple effect all that said just to make the point that this is a flattering sweater i grabbed it last minute on the way to the dressing room but i ne,1
2043,I really like these shorts im quite petite and have a hard time finding shorts to fit other than high end denim brands these are great bc of the sizing i wear a in most denim and the in these fit perfectly also love the length not too short or long going to order a second color i have the plum and love it,1
2044,I ordered this in the peach color and it is a beautiful pale color the underside of the cuff has a pretty pattern on it so if you roll it up once it adds a little something extra it is extremely see through though so you might want to wear a tank under,1
2045,I purchased the black tunic as others have mentioned this piece goes great with skinny jeans or leggings when im rushing to find something to wear this is one of my gotos nice coverage not seethrough,1
2046,Loved the brushstroke design and simplicity of black on white however the tee was way too big it looked boxy and sloppy,0
2047,Fits true to size soft material and unique look the sleeves and overall cut of this shirt are flattering i was worried it might look boxy or baggy but it didnt at all the dark gray is a gorgeous color and can be dressed up or down definitely going to be a staple in my closet,1
2048,Beautiful lace shell great with jeans for a night out or with a skirt for a more formal affair good quality not itchy,1
2049,I love the style easy to wear to work or out for an evening great quality,1
2050,I wore this dress to work with a tan pair of booties and the compliments started upon entry and did not stop till the end of the day very feminine and comfy all at once,1
2051,Like the previous review said i was excited to receive this top i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it to my chagrin when i put it on it just fell right down and pooled around my waist i wish there were smaller sizes to order sadly this is going back,0
2052,Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath,0
2053,When you look at the online pictures of the navy colored dress the stripes are diagonal however that is not the case with the dress in person the stripes are all horizontal and not that flattering such a bummer because i love maeve dresses and thought this would be a great addition to my summer dress rotation alas not very flattering so back it goes,0
2054,This sweater coat caught my attention online so i went in search for it at my local store its a flattering fit across the chest and shoulders very well made the length is mid thigh i am lbs i went with the small with the thought of wearing nothing too bulky under it it does have an attached belt that can easily be knotted together or each on its own for another look if you opt to leave it open its light weight enough for cool days or evenings but also warm enough for colde,1
2055,These cords are soft comfy and my normal size for tts the length was fine for my height i really like the bronze color it is almost a yellow,1
2056,Love this skirt perfect length and cut pilcro make more of these i ordered up so that it hug more on my hips than waist just prefer that better but i think if you can pull of the waist look go for it would buy more in different colors,1
2057,I liked the colors of this dress and the material was fine but i could not tell from the pictures that the seams at the waist are atypical and frankly unflattering they are scalloped at the hips so it looks horrible if you have any hips at all,0
2058,I adore this dress i wantedneeded to add a few velvet pieces to my wardrobe and when i saw this online i decided this had to be one of them im and pounds and ordered the xsmall and it fits me perfectly the color is so rich and the details are delicate understated and yet striking i intend to wear this for a variety of occasions,1
2059,This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer unique and absolutely beautiful i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller hopefully the designs for springsummer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket,1
2060,I really love this top i got the ivory and now i will probably get the black too if you get it in your normal size im almost always an xs and got this in xs its fitted and flattering the seam across the sternum makes it feel like an empire top which always seems to look good on me it is fitting in the chest and arms its really lightweight and has sleeves so i will wear this even in summer,1
2061,I am not a fray fan but this dress has a modern vintage look and it looks tailored check out the ruffle sleeves surprising detail size regular small falls right above my knees perfect at the chest im b waist hips but the sleeves are inches pass my wrist the ruffle sleeves are too pretty to be rolled up so i got the petite s sleeves at perfect length torso fits better but length is an inch shorter thank you cloth and stone for finally making petite sizes,1
2062,This dress is adorable dress it up or dress it down,1
2063,I love this dress it is loose fitting so be prepared for that i ordered an xs i believe the dress was intended to fit this way though and i do not think it looks too big on me i typically wear a or in dresses this would be a great dress to wear if you were planning on eating a big meal ha i cant wait to wear this dress in the summer and believe i will wear it often it has more of a boho look to it i do think it could be worn with heels though i will probably wear it with flat gol,1
2064,The design and style of shirt is quite cute but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc nor does the mountain find itself near chamomixit is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base,0
2065,Really like the quality color and overall design of these jeans they ran a little long on me but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties i didnt need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed so glad that was the case given the price tag on them i am lbs and wear a size which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed definitely recommend these jeans,1
2066,What a pity this blouse has a beautiful design however it doesnt fit well on the body its not really a size problem its just not a well fitted blouse the color is very deceptive it looks white on the picture but its actually pink im probably going to return it,0
2067,This is a a great piece i tried it on in denim and went out and ordered the red checked print this was so cute i loved it in the red checked and then ordered the denim it can be dressed up or down it is comfortable and there is an edgy quality to the look you can wear heals and a statement necklace and it really is dressed up order a size down and it works well thank you retailer,1
2068,Love love this sweatershirt i have worn it out to dinner and work with leggings it is soft and comfy the pleats in the back are beautiful and do not require constant ironing i even bought it in the pink,1
2069,This dress is even more gorgeous in person i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years i think i have finally found the one i should note i am and this dress goes all the way to my knees it may swallow someone on the shorter side,1
2070,I tried this dress on in the orange and loved it on me and felt it ran tts in my regular size small im a d but very petite body type otherwise and didnt feel like this billowed out as much as some other reviewers described it does have a loose feel on top which i actually like and inside there is a comfortable striped strapless top part that holds me in at the same time i liked the feel colors and lenth of the fabric plus i love anything with an elastic waist so i definitely plan on buyi,1
2071,Love this tunicand so do others so many compliments already ive worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants it needs a cami underneath since its sheer i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces,1
2072,As in super comfortable and a joy to wear i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on the moment i put it on i knew it was for me i missed out on getting it in the other color i hope you get more in other colors,1
2073,This looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on longer in the back i love the style of the sleeves very flattering style and fun flirty and feminine slightly see through depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami a really fresh look for summer i do not think it looks cheap i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not,1
2074,A seasonal must have nicely made medium weight cozy buttons to half way down i am petite and the xs fits with enough room for layers underneath highly recommend,1
2075,The peplum for this time hit me in the middle of my rib cage not at my natural waist so it looked very odd when it flared out with the peplum so high up i am busty so its possible this would not be the case for everyone but i generally can wear peplum tops with no problem i was disappointed to return it the fabric was very nice and the concept behind the shirt was a good one,0
2076,I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did i am usually a small in tops but had read that it runs small i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small it is definitely a swing top its best feature is the detailing its gorgeous i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket,1
2077,Ordered it in small regular and xtra small petite what was surprising was that the xtra small petite fit better meaning more room across the chest im normally a medium or medium petite but this runs large if youre unsure of a size get both and return the one that doesnt fit as well its much better in person and looks very rich in colors and quality the only complaint i have is there were some loose yarn pieces just dangling off the edges i trimmed up with scissors and they didnt e,1
2078,Not long ago i bought a pair of hei hei pants that i love so when i saw these i immediately tried them on i love them too they are pretty and comfortable and i am so happy to get away from tight jeans they are also very flattering size wise i find that i have to size down with hei hei perhaps because they have a looser cut,1
2079,Im petite and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater that is the look that is portrayed on the model the sweater is scratchy the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right it looks great on the model here but not on me going back so bummed the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little holes or openings across the shoulders so there is a tiny bit of detail overall not a great sweater,0
2080,I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe it is really cute and a flattering cut i just had a baby so its perfect for showing some curves without clinging if anything id say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected but is still very flattering i think im still getting used to my new bustline soft comfy fabric not too hot i get compliments when i wear it,1
2081,This top seemed so unique online but in person it was really nothing like the pics super full shorter cut the quality wasnt what i thought it would be i will gladly pay for nicequality fabric and unique prints anyday but this wasnt any of those things,0
2082,The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece i am lb and i took a a might have been ok but i felt more comfortable in the and it had a really nice fitthe quality is good but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges so im not sure how it will wear,1
2083,This top is so cute and so comfy i love the details especially in the back this embodies what i love about retailer clothing the little unique touches that you find anywhere else very pleased,1
2084,These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me i can go between a and a and tried the and they were fine that said the fabric completed turned me off it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought theyd be the fabric is just too stiff and the sheen made them feel cheap unfortunately,0
2085,This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years agoi have this cardigan and have loved wearing it i think it only came in cream color unfortunately i caught the cutouts a few times and the cutouts are slightly ripped in spotsnot very noticeable but i know theyre there so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan this time from meadow rue i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size smalli am usually a s,1
2086,I ordered the pink and it is the slightest hint of pink mixed with ivory it fits true to size the detailing of the crochet is outstanding it reminds me of seashells that my daughter i collected last year when we visited san diego i wish the teal green one would be in stock in xl i would grab it up its not the softest knit but its very comfortable to wear all day very pretty version of a cardigan,1
2087,I was so happy to see this dress at one of my local retailer stores since ive had this in my basket since i first saw it i tried it on in my usual size and it runs true to size in all areas the length is as shown int he picture i am and it hit me right above the knee i am short waisted and the dress fit perfect sat right above my waist and then lay just as shown not too much material to make you look fuller in the hips and also not too young looking i am planning to wear it to,1
2088,The quality and aesthetic of this dress is wonderful the fit and look are classic i am and the dress falls mid thigh this is a beautiful dress for a special event simple but with sparkle at the neckline and an unusual print i am very happy with this purchase,1
2089,This runs very short i had to size up so i could wear as a dress still too short to wear to work with a cardi but adorable to wear to daytime summer events and date nights with hubby i am length may work better for shorter women love the style and fabric very feminine float and easy to wear with sandals on a hot summer day,1
2090,The dress is wellstructured and refined enough to wear with a cardigan to work on casual fridays but fun enough to wear on its own to a summer festival because of the length i would suggest wearing with heels as it hits below the knee i would suggest a size down especially if you are smallerbusted,1
2091,This sweater dress is very beautiful in person the colors are very fall i actually decided against it only because i felt it was too busy for my personality as for the fit it runs fairly true to size maybe slightly small i tried on my usual medium but i think i would have sized up for a more relaxed look for reference im lbs and wear a size this could be quite a stunning piece on the right person,1
2092,This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas maybe by summer retailer could make one,1
2093,Fun outerwear for the fall the color is a bit more grey than the photo shows at least on my screen but i still think itll go with a lot,1
2094,This is comfy and casual and fun to wear moss ombr is darker and less ombr than pictured so i wish i had gotten the other color way instead i can see myself wearing this for running errands grabbing takeout and other important things like hanging out on my couch definitely size down or this will look too wide boxy,1
2095,This dress is a winner im baffled that there is only one review i thought this was a dolan dress the material is soft and substantial the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations im and purchased size m,1
2096,I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online the material is extremely soft comfortable not at all itchy tts i fell in love with it immediately and cant believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work with some skinny ankle length pants can be dressed up or down this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall,1
2097,These pants are elegant and chic great for tall women wearing to a yacht cruise cant wait would have loved to wait for the sale but i had to have them and i am very pleased,1
2098,Beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft but they didnt finish the bottom hem the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays the rest of the dress is so polished it just doesnt make sense also while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest almost like a water mark just overall bad attent,0
2099,A romantic find light and airy the color is slightly darker than shown the soft subtle ruffles give it just the right touch,1
2100,Beautiful skirt with a fun graphic pattern and embroidered texture i tried on my usual xs as well as a s to compare they both fit but i decided to keep the xs since the skirt has a little bit of a stretch thanks to a hidden elastic panel in the back plus it looks best at your natural waist im and often need to wear petite but this skirt is already quite short so i bought the regular size looks great barelegged or with tights love the pockets too,1
2101,I really wasnt sure if this dress would work for me so i was very excited when i fell in love with it i havent experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted thank goodness i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress i have worn it with tights a belt and shortheeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings wearing it more tunic style the slip underneath is a great feature as well it does,1
2102,This dress is adorable the material is thin and wrinkles easily but it is so flattering the cut is a little flowy like typical offtheshoulder dresses but this one is cut in at the waist so your figure is not swallowed up it combines the sexy summer vibe of an offtheshoulder look but flatters like a fit and flare dress it is fairly short while i am only in an xs it falls just a bit further up on my legs than the model pictured makes no sense to me the color is a rich coral pink a,1
2103,After reading the reviews i was hesitant to purchase but glad i did im usually an xs or s depending on the brand but i got this in a xxs it fits perfectly and is so cute does not look like a bathrobe at all i love it because its almost like a cardigan blazerlooks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan,1
2104,These pants fit the bill theyre soft and very comfortable easy to wear day and night these are a little higher on the waist which i love purchased two pair i purchased the regular and they come to my ankles,1
2105,I have alst years versiona dn they are essentially the smae minus some leather parts removed this jacket is great the back si a little shorter so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out i love hte darker color i wish it came is super dark rinsei usually buy petites but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket i am holding myself back to order this on,1
2106,For those who are wondering this sweater coat is lambswool and acrylic the original version of this coat was lambswool acrylic yet the price remained the samei would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in lambswool like the original version this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials,0
2107,I love this blouse i get so many compliments when i wear it i cant wait for warmer weather to pair it with my coral short skirt from retailer currently i wear it with a pair of slim cream colored pants and flats it works great it is a little on the short side but it just adds to the tailored look of the cut however if youre taller than or i would expect it to be much shorter on you youve been warned overall this is a great addition to your wardrobe and it washes nicel,1
2108,I ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather the printed fabric is really prettysadly they seem to run on the large size i wear size pants but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist i am sending them back and getting the smaller size,1
2109,Great for hot weather dress up and dress down dont need to decide what to match with and bottom or top,1
2110,Nice to have colors rather than a solid top i actually bought the pink also because i like the fit so much im and wear a size tts i like the cut and its long enough which can sometimes be a problem for me,1
2111,After the second wash the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart after sewing it back up wearing it and washing it a third time the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well not sure if this was just a fluke but it was very disappointing now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact i must say that this is a great dress i would have returned the dress to retailer but ive already washed and worn it so againvery disappointing i would say,0
2112,Love this perfect in the summer with bright strappy heels or sandals or booties in the winter,1
2113,This is great without a belt with or without leggings it drapes just right and is flattering for big busted big behind women like me,1
2114,Im and have athletic legs these jeans are so comfy long enough and look good on the booty the photo is deceiving as they are much longer i wish they carried more colors its hard to find a jean i really like and i really like these,1
2115,Love the fabric comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress good for those cool fall mornings,1
2116,I ordered this top in size xl there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much this accentuated my pearshape and was unflattering the sizing on the top portion sleeves was truetosize the material is so rough scratchy uncomfortable they should have used a softer fabric the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received at i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous matching line i didnt notice the mismatched sleeves of the,0
2117,Unfortunately this top is shirtlength and im only needs to be about longer made of sweatshirt material which i wouldnt mind if it were longer also runs very wide ordered an xs and could have gone smaller,0
2118,I saw the black in store and had to try on it is very very cute i would say it fits a bit small i tried my usual medium and while it fit it was a little short id take you could take your regular size or size up i would not size down in this one adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time,1
2119,The print caught my eye then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on i am only and have a small waist but sized dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well this dress fit me perfectly i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny,1
2120,I absolutely love this sweater it is a beautiful deep blue color i love the unique cuff on the sleeves i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it,1
2121,This ia a great casual topthe design flaws mentioned in previous reviews are what gives it a trendier lookthe length is perfect but i needed to size down from a large to medium because the fit was a bit loose on the body and armwould like to add that while it is good quality its still somewhat overpriced for a t shirt material top lace accent,1
2122,It is one of the best dress for the season light nice color elegant can not find more word of it really great buy this brand has very special design that really amazed me recently just want to give a to the designer,1
2123,The raspberry color is really stunning i have been looking for colored tights for a while and had difficulty finding really rich colors i was thrilled when i saw these ive worn them once so far very comfortable and seem like they will last,1
2124,This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days great fit not form fitting with no elastic or rayon soft cotton with great details im ish and the medium fit great i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now the white was to sheer for my taste though,1
2125,I was hesitent to order this was worried it would be too shapeless im glad i ordered it as it is light and flowy though not so much that it makes you look like a shapeless tent the colors are vibrant and the smooth fabric feels good against your skin it is lined i had no issues with the bust im c i wish it were an inch longer im,1
2126,This is a nice sweater very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me i found this one to be slimming for reference i am lbs and a size medium or,1
2127,Dont be put off by the sparkle this jacket is amazing lovely detail with the print on print with the sequined patches i love this retailer in house brand elevenses i take a medium in this brand and the medium fits full with room like a bomber style would offer i had tried a small in my local store and it was not a small small so if you want a tighter fit then go for a small but i like thinks to have a more fluid feel i have a dd chest as reference i plan to wear this in spring,1
2128,I bought this shirt in blue because the store was out of gray and i had to have it right then and it is my favorite it is comfortable and durable i also appreciate the length of the shirt it is long enough for me to not worry about putting my arms up it is an overall great buy i want one in every color,1
2129,I tried this in the store a few weeks ago when it just came out because i loved the neutral design and look of it and came back the following week to purchase it with my discount code because it really is worth itpros true aline silhouette if you have curves and hips like i do c hourglass lbs then this skirt will flatter you completely theres a lovely swing to the dress and it drapes wonderfully because its a thicker fabric runs tts i can normally wear,1
2130,This sweater vest is the best it is so versatile ive already worn it over a dress and recieved compliments all day the knit is substantial without being to thin or heavy i love the little flecks of color in the yarn as well it makes coordinating easy i thought the faux fur might be too overwhelming or hot but thankfully its not at all runs true to size worth full price,1
2131,I tried this sweater on in the store regretted not purchasing it and ended up buying it online the fabric is soft seems to be good quality and hangs nicely i purchased the taupe color and it is a rich pretty color,1
2132,I love this jacket and cant get enough of it it has side pockets as well as the buttonedpockets i love the cinched waist option for a more fitted look,1
2133,This blouse was so cute i really wanted to love it as others mentioned there is something wrong with the fit im not a large person but the top was tight even though i ordered a medium and a small,0
2134,I am long waisted and lbs c that being said i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly a petite would have been far too short so i would recommend a regular size if youre a petite also i have a big chest and this was very flattering because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck but this classic peter pan collar looks great i purchased the black i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave the black and white o,1
2135,So happy i purchased this its a gorgeous piece and perfect for fall and winter the colors are soft and beautiful and i feel like this will pair well with a lot of shirts in my closet,1
2136,These socks were so narrow especially on top that they pinched my thighs and were almost painful to wear all day my thighs are pretty narrow im only five feet tall and my legs and hips are the thinnest part of my body i understand that they need to be reinforced on top so that they dont slip down but these are definitely made for a person who is unhealthily skinny one size is definitely not true they also snag easily,0
2137,I always look for things to hide parts without making my parts look even more pronounced this top is much cuter in person than online it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didnt notice the length is perfect the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin even though it has stripes perfect spring summer top,1
2138,I purchase this top of what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunictop in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details but what is going on with the midsection where there is at least inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope,0
2139,This top i was hesitant to try this on because it felt too busy however it is a must have its just the right amount of lace and detail i am typically an m in retailer tops sometimes l depending on the designer im a ddd i initially tried a l in this thinking it had no stretch but ended up going with the medium the arms were a tad tight but stretched slightly after an hour of wear and it fits perfectly everywhere i think if you size up it will be too blousy highly recommend this,1
2140,This dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric also you cant beat the price for an retailer dress,1
2141,I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top when it arrived the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low on me granted im a pear the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way the only thing i liked was the color back it went,0
2142,The material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky i think this dress is truetosize or maybe runs a little bit big but only by a little bit i bought a medium and am a size in tops and in pants the dress hugs nicely on the upper body arms chest ribs and flares just a little bit on the hipstummybutt area it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha,1
2143,Pretty much awesome i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see and i could almost get away with it too bad i dindt try it on before hte of f dresses also i dont have an occasion to wear thislength is midi but since it is gathered i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on mecolor is very nice overall sexy dressmaterial is soft and comfortable nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale,1
2144,This is one of the softest blouses i now own it feels and wears like a premium blouse i love it and it actually makes my backside look smaller too even though it is flowy it is true to size if you have small arms and a chest than you could go down a size this is one of my new favorite purchases and i wear it with the cabled knit bomber and boots,1
2145,Fabulous with leggings i am lbs and always wear pxs the pxs was too large and fit like a ps so order a size down i really like it and going to exchange for a smaller size,1
2146,I was so excited to order this dress i loved that it had a normal neck nice length and there wasnt a hole in the back but this dress is just plain awful the top fit tight across the bust it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric i could not get the zipper to lay flat the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the,0
2147,This sweater is flattering fun and practical i wear to work and out at night to dressier functions i bought both the green and black both are cute on and super soft,1
2148,This is the most perfect tunic out there it is comfy flattering and fits perfect it can be dressed up or dressed down definitely worth it to buy in every color,1
2149,I love this top lovely light airy material though i dont think ill wear a cami under it im usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small i love the way it fits,1
2150,Is it possible to be in love with a dress i think so and i am when i put this dress on it literally took my breath away it is beautiful and very wellmade this dress is so fun i wore it to an event this past weekend and received more compliments than i ever have on something im wearing this beauty is so incredibly comfortable and bonus it has pockets i am a petite and it runs very true to size for me in the store it looked more navy than black but as i have it home it is definite,1
2151,What drew me to this shirt was the beautiful silver and gold embroidery on the front the shirt was folded at the store which makes sense because if it were hung it up fewer people would try it on this shirt is sheer from the front and more sheer in the back this is what bugs me about so many clothes that are made these days they are so cheaply made so thin with cloth that you are forced to layer with a camisole or something else in order to wear it in public i cant wear sheer clothes,0
2152,The top ran too large and it made me look more bustier than i am and rounder in my midsection by how it fell on me maybe wouldve been better for someone with a smaller bust the quality of the fabric was just okay,0
2153,I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fallwinter maxi in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better,1
2154,Great everyday dress i bought a small lbs and it really fits nicely,1
2155,Love this zip cardigan with removable faux fur it did not look like much on the hanger but once on it is soft rich and just adorable it can be dressed up or down perfect for a finishing piece over a dress to wearing with jeans and skirts the fabric is soft but substantial the only negative for me is the zipper sticks a little a plus it is a ivory shade and is a good basic i chose my typical medium and fits perfect dd chest for reference sale price plus promo made this a winner i,1
2156,In love just wow beautiful colors although theyre dark you can still see all the variations the flannel is light and not too heavy theres visible black lace just below the shoulder pretty buttons ordered the large my normal size and its a perfect fit roomy but not oversized so well made i think this will be a favorite for years,1
2157,I thought this would be cute with leggings based upon the length on the model i forget that the models are almost feet tall this has a polyester slip goes under it that snaps onto the shoulders it came down to my knees and was completely like a sack no leggings and boots with this one lovely material but not at all figure flattering,0
2158,It is a beautiful shirt and fits perfectly i purchased it in ivory and although not a true ivory it has some pinkish tones to it it is absolutely beautiful looks perfect with a long necklace and jeans,1
2159,After having my third child i was looking for clothes to hide my tummy ive always loved the comfort of a romper but the typical cinched waist was never flattering on me this romper does not disappoint it hides areas i want hidden but does so with style i get numerous compliments whenever i wear this i cannot say enough wonderful things about this piece,1
2160,This is a wow so chicreminds of something i would have bought in paris worth every penny even my husband loves it on mehis words were its a standout i work in the design industry so i am always looking for something that represents what i donailed it,1
2161,This romper is cute wellmade and true to size but i havent figured it out how to put this on without having someone tie the back ties which pretty much means that going to the bathroom is not an option while you have this romper on not sure what the designers were thinking here im returning this one,0
2162,Im a short girl but i usually wear tops in a small or medium at retailer for me i would have needed this shirt in a size at least one notch smaller than even offered this shirt is adorable love the details i wanted it so bad which is why i paid so much for a basic tshirt still it was large to the point of frumpiness and could have used some sort of scoop or vneck to break up the dots,0
2163,This dress has a great shape and fabric but the v neckline is too deeplow and the arm holes are also cut too low would loved to have been able to keep it but had to return,0
2164,This dress is probably the most comfortable dress ive ever had the fabric is very comfortable and breathable and it flatters my straight body type,1
2165,for super comfy warm leggings bought two pairs for myself and another pair for my mother lets be honest ill probably be buying another pair,1
2166,This sweater is thick and does cover the bra well i did not find it to be well made the ribbing seemed to be attached loosely in places i am a size large with a b cup and a bit thicker through the middle to my middle age dismay putting this sweater on in coral made me feel like a giant peach for those with larger breasts it is likely more flattering,0
2167,I love this top and wear it all the time its a gorgeous pale blue and feels amazingit is a tighter fitting shirt so if you like looser clothes size up,1
2168,This dress is huge also i was super disappointed in the fabric i thought it would be silly like a georgette but it was coarse more like a poplin and thin i thought it looked cheap,0
2169,This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy fun they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short and the regular length fits me perfectly this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me,1
2170,I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste its wide and not tailored at the waste the key to super cute fit is to size down then it will look like it does on the model in the picture i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture its super adorable in person the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate,1
2171,I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings i usually wear a s and even the xs is was too pig it drapes like a smock the material is heavy the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and colorstill looking for the perfect dress,0
2172,I love this dress my husband loves this dress on me i ordered on line it did not come in my usual and it was only in petite i ordered the petite it fits fine a little shorter than expected but i am so it is finevery well made and lined,1
2173,This is an amazing looking skirt it has such an exciting pattern on it and is very flattering it is very light weight thoughalmost flimsy butit is not a deal breaker i wear it and love it,1
2174,My hips are very narrow and i dont have much of a waistline in aline skirts and anything that sits below the waist i wear a size skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline if this is typically your style of skirt i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size its very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things,1
2175,Love the asymmetrical hem waist fit snugly as in perfectly it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well a little stiff in the fabric classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didnt feel like we could wear it all year round cant petite or p was great lbs,1
2176,This dress in a lovely platinum is feminine and fits perfectly easy to wear and comfy too highly recommend,1
2177,I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath the only reason i rated it as runs small is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath the sleeves are long but can be rolled,1
2178,Its a beautiful lace designed tank top in a vibrant navy blue however the lace on the hemlines were snagged the top was much shorter than i had anticipated im returning it to the store unfortunately,0
2179,I tried on an and a and both worked perfecto the had just a tiny bit more room to tuck in a shirt with,1
2180,This is classic retailer at its best quality style a little something extra makes this piece something that will likely live in my fall winter wardrobe for decades to come first the quality is superb soft gray wool with a delicate floral embroidery motif on the front military buttons down the front with a fit and flare waist on a length coat versatile enough to wear as a sweater or light coat for early fall fit is generous enough to easily fit a bulky sweater underneath and lay,1
2181,This dress is my new favorite the style is trendy and feminine while forgiving in the tummy area without looking maternity or too baggy it is so versatile because it can be dressed up or down and its a great transitional dress bc once it cools down it will look great with a denim jacket cardi booties etc i normally wear a m sometimes a l im dd but the m fits great the slip is a little snug across the chest but i definitely couldnt size up bc then the dress would be too bi,1
2182,The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it it looked beautiful until i sat down the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day cant wear this again,0
2183,I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors it is comfy and thin i purchased my usual size it is so adorable with the lattice stripe,1
2184,Love these jeans for summer i followed the advice of previous reviewers and sized down to a after wearing these for a few hours they stretched a little and fit great they look sweet with the palo alto blouse and the embroidered edessa top highly recommend,1
2185,I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy but i didnt believe them and bought it anyway i was wrong this top is so boxy and wide just awful,0
2186,This little dress is extremely cute and very comfortable i didnt pay enough attention to the picture and totally missed the faux wrap skirt but that only adds to the appeal and is well done not showing too much skin this dress looks great with a white denim jacket or a red cardi it will get lots of use and really is a quarters of the year piece,1
2187,This is definitely true to size i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt the medium was spot on not too tight and not too baggy i think its a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties it looks like denim too which i wasnt expecting way better in person,1
2188,This top is just as pretty in person as it is online i usually buy petites but ordered this one in the regular length and im glad i did perfect on me at my usual size medium fit great everywhere else too love their fabric choice as well im getting really tired of the thin cottons and slub jersey materials being used so often now deletta made my day once again,1
2189,In the fall and winter i live in my uniform of skinny jeans boots and a long sweater this cardigan will be perfect the fabric is very nice quality and the colors are gorgeous i can see myself wearing it over and over,1
2190,Love this shirt great fabric and fit trying to wait for a sale to buy several others in additional colors,1
2191,I got one of these tanks and went back and bought two more online i have the gray green and white the white requires a undershirt for me but thats no problem the shirts are darling theyre under activewear and i think they could be used that way but i definitely dont theyre simple but have a nice flow and the front and back are perfect i love the material and the colors i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones i dont love bright colors but i love the green white,1
2192,I ordered this dress online and i love it im only so its always a challenge for me with maxis but this one fit the bill not too much fabric to be overwhelming on a shorter frame and the length was perfect the fabric is very comfortable and moves with you also the quality is great i ordered a small petite but i probably could have gone xs petite this would dress would be flattering on most people need same dress more colors,1
2193,This is such a cute top i bought it when it was a new arrival and couldnt be more thrilled it washes well in the the washing machine the only flaw is that it runs on the short side otherwise im thrilled,1
2194,I purchased both colors offered and love this light weight full of neat detail piece to layer with other tops the material is very soft and stretchy making it easy to wear over another item i love the little shirt tail detail in back along with the drawstring trim in front another piece that i am sure i will wear for years to come and the fit is true to sizethanks antro,1
2195,This top was too big for me lbs and ordered xxs fit was fine and wanted it too work but too overwhelming on me as well will be going back,0
2196,I wanted to love this sweater but the fit is just awkward it is very short and box and ends up being very short in the back i am going to return this item,0
2197,I just go these socks in one of my beauty boxes there is nothing like a new pair of socks they feel amazing no matter what you do these are ultra soft and inline with other slipper socks i have tried with the grippies on the bottom i like the color black style actually i like all the new styles at retailer right now and i didnt think i would like the higher tabs in the back but it turns out i love them to make sure the sock is covering my whole ankle when i put my shoes on the,1
2198,Off the shoulder is everywhere and this is a great shirt for the fall,1
2199,Love this dress bodice and lace at bottom gives is a cute layered look there are buttons on the front see pic but it does not button up im a bit on the hippy sidephysically hippy that isand this dress did a great job of downplaying my hips im and this dress hit just above my knees a bit longer than on the model in the photo would look cute with a jean or military jacket i am wearing a small lbs b chest,1
2200,I dont know how this dress looks on your monitor on mine it looks dark green which it is i was pleased with this aspect since i had hoped it would be as pictured despite the color description as slate that aside it was a bit too large on me and since i am on the shorter side at i looked a bit like a childs doll in it i wish it had looked better on me because the color is beautiful and so is the quality,1
2201,This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans and they were worth every penny i love the fit the distressing everything about them they make me feel like i look amazing which is what good jeans should do i wear a in pilcro jeans but based on some reviews went up to a in these and they are perfect also im but the crop length hits at my ankle which is perfect,1

2203,This pants are very comfortable and add a little flare to my typical mom pajama look i found them true to size size small fit my lbs frame comfortable to sleep and lounge in,1
2204,I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top i get compliments whenever i wear it think hd in paris might be my new goto,1
2205,I was expecting a nice golden yellow color but what i received was very dull in color with greenish undertones very disappointed will be returning,0
2206,Love this when i first saw it online i thought it was a bit pricey for a plain white shirt but i finally gave in and ordered it im so glad i did ive worn it twice in one week so it wont be difficult to get my moneys worth its very soft and fits perfectly looks great with jeans or dress pants i like to tuck the front in my pants and leave the back out,1
2207,I own two poodles and love anything poodle print i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale but it is horrible the fit is like wearing a pillowcase it was about inches too wide on each side while the arms fit it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short wide and wrong i was in love with the print however i had to return it,0
2208,Love this romper it is beautifully made and classy the fabric flows and the construction is soft and solid im and and the small is a little roomy but comfortably so cant wait to where it,1
2209,Comfortable and flows well does run large order one size smaller,1
2210,I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me but this is it the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable the sash can be tied several waysfront back or side i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus it looks like a d,1
2211,This dress was just perfect the fit was just right and it is made well love the ruffles could definitely be dressed up or wore casual great dress all around a keeper,1
2212,Loved these when i tried them on they fit well and were so flattering i am a size and tall and have a bubble butt and thicker thighs with a narrow waist i tried on a they we a little tight on my bum and thighs but the waist was perfect tried on a and they were much more comfortable on my legs and worked on my waist as well i thought all was good but after wearing them out for not even ten minutes they started slipping down constantly and loosed up around all areas especially my,0
2213,I am beyond pleased with this dress photos do not do it justice and no it does not look like a gown it is comfortable forgiving and will be a staple for years to come i am and the large worked perfectly for me in length and size this is my first maxi dress and im thrilled do not miss this piece it is special,1
2214,It jacket of the season this bomber is absolutely perfect not only is the embroidery beautiful but its super comfy as well its lightweight nicely lined and well made i only gave it four stars for quality simply because the embroidery could get pulled and frayed if not careful you should expect that with any silky embroidered fabric however i would highly recommend this jacket for any body type,1
2215,I love this sweater dress i got the ivory color in a size small im a size i feel in love with it while shopping with a friend who kind of rolled her eyes at it i went back later because i knew i loved it since the ones on the sale rack were covered with dust and dirt at the hem i ordered it on line in m small and the small fit better it is so soft and the color is great,1
2216,This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops im surprised it isnt one size fits all bc it is very generous in the xss which i got and im a i can see wearing this all year long even summer cool nights very classic style the picture on website looks frumpy to me but on it is very flattering,1
2217,I wasnt sure how clingy this dress might be or how it would look on my curvy body its actually really lovely it runs large but not overwhelming nice length above the knee in the front slightly longer in the back the colors are really beautiful i got the darker color will definitely wear this with a belt otherwise i think as other reviewers said it will be too maternitylooking i got this at a great sale price,1
2218,You can adjust this dress a bit with the straps but its huge the colors were also a bit grayish which i didnt expect,0
2219,I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt if only the cut wasnt so odd the sides of the skirt wing out for a very distracting and unflattering look the stiff feltlike quality of the material only makes matters worse in that respect the model photos are not at all accurate it also runs large i had to go down one full size,0
2220,Purchased this top in navy blue it is versatile appropriate for the office and to go out i specifically like the look with white jeans it looks put together the quality is good and there are several nice detsils in the design highly recomnend it,1
2221,I absolutely love this skirt the picture does not do it justice it is absolutely beautiful and fits perfectly i received so many compliments when i wore it,1
2222,I saw this in the store and fell in love with it i didnt buy it at first but i couldnt stop thinking about how comfortable it was so i went back and purchased it its soft and very comfortable im glad i went back for it,1
2223,This top is lovely great colors for spring light material flowy and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette i did have to size up to a im almost always a to make some room for the girls im a cd depending on the brand so larger chested women may want to size up but its well worth it,1
2224,This suit is great for curvy and slightly flawed figures the vintage look delivers full coverage that still looks sexy not your mothers onepiece,1
2225,Bought this dress for engagement photos and was a little worried about sizing but when i got it it fit perfectly and was very comfortable it runs true to size my only complaint is that there was a missing button on the sleeve but because there was an extra it was easily fixed definitely recommend,1
2226,This top is perfect for wanting that fallwinter look in warmer climates the slits on the sides allow for a lot of movement and turtleneck is just right i love wearing it with my paige bell canyon flairs and some clogs my only thing i wish was that it was cut in so much at the top as how you can see at the models armpit wish that part was a little wider it would be a bit more flattering otherwise great top i have it in black and been thinking about getting it in the orange color too,1
2227,I just bought this shirt on sale id been eyeing it for a bit and when it went on sale i had to get it its really cute and comfortable and fits really nicely its not too short or boxy and the detail on the sleeves is great,1
2228,I loved the way it looks on fit tts only problem for me was it was so itchy there is that small amt of wool in it if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you,0
2229,These are a great casual workday pant the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option,1
2230,These shorts are great both the design and fit are beautiful i would say that these run true to size i bought my usual size and they fit perfectly they fit a little high waisted which i love the material is so soft and are so comfortable i would recommend these shorts if youre thinking about it,1
2231,I needed a pink dress for a local breast cancer awareness luncheon this is a perfect fit for the occasion,1
2232,I ordered this online with fingers crossed in my usual size m it fits well albeit a tad snug although very flattering on my curvy frame it is an unusual color for me but i ended up loving it in person where you can really appreciate all the detailed woven patterns in the fabric there is a slip underneath which ends several inches above the hem,1
2233,Worth every penny i sized down one size and they look amazing,1
2234,I love the fit and feel of this shirt the fit is narrow but true to size the stitching details are beautiful and make this shirt really versatile,1
2235,I have been dreaming of the perfect overall that i can live in this springsummer these overalls completely fit the bill i would normally wear a size but i wanted the fit to be more relaxed with a slight slouchy look i went with a a size and they are exactly what i wanted i feel like i can move around feely in these they are extremely comfortable and the denim is pretty lightweight i highly recommend these,1
2236,This tunic is super comfy and will look great with leggings or skinny jeans i absolutely love the detailing on the sleeves i am so glad i ordered this item,1
2237,Flattering cut perfect for work or play even better yet it was on sale if they had it in other colors i would buy it beautiful highquality garment like all the others i have purchased at retailer,1
2238,This product was offered in a pink color which compliments many color palettes perfect for layering,1
2239,I just adore these shorts from art dept they are casual yet slightly structured the length is just perfect for me no ride up no wrinkles i cant stand wrinkled shorts and the fringe gives these shorts a fun and playful look just perfect for a stroll on the beach or shopping with your girlfriends i know these shorts are going to be a staple in my summer wardrobe for years can i have these in more colors and patterns too,1
2240,These are very soft and fit well at first i was a bit put off on the stone wash of the fabric each pair is different but it adds character and given the color and the soft fabric its a nice difference i love the pockets they are deep enough for anything you want to put into them i love good deep pockets and my cell fits nice into my back pocket take notice makers of womans pants there are some of us who like deep pocketsonly one negative i have noticed heihei is not sewing,1
2241,Highly recommend this top received lots of compliments on the day that i wore recommend wearing with a tank top,1
2242,Too small too flare nice thick fabric not my favorite pant,0
2243,Easy fun and flattering fits tts i normally wear a ml or i ordered a large and it fits well the tie at the back lets you wear it as tight or loose as you want it the length is good for my frame,1
2244,I bought the multicolor stripe and it is adorable i am lbs and purchased a size small it is a perfect length and drapes wellnot too tight at all i received a ton of compliments the first time i wore it highly recommend,1
2245,These jeans i tried these on in addition to the high rise paige denim and these won out hands down classic flattering fit from mother with an element of edginess with the frayed hem these are long enough on me im to cuff at the ankle if i dont want a distressed look on a particular day they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down i have muscular calves and thighs but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a,1
2246,This is the softest most perfectly cut basic love the black wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered as usual with retailer basics i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso,1
2247,This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isnt bulky to wear under coats etc it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth it has a flattering fit i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front it adds more interest to the look,1
2248,This is a season item that can function as a cardigan or a jacket and will look equally good with jeans or with work slacks the seaming gives it a bit of structure the asymmetrical zipper gives it a little twist the texture gives it interest i bought it in navy and im considering the ivory,1
2249,Love this top bought it in black and first day i wore it to a party and i think everyone gave me a compliment it is very flattering to my shape have a bit of a pooch and cant even tell looks great with skinny jeans look forward to wearing many more times,1
2250,I took a risk and bought this blouse and got a wonderful surprise i bought my usual size small c waist and it was perfect the details of this blouse are amazing you cannot see the flecks of coppergold leaves all over the fabric or the gold threads running down the seam in the front it is really really beautiful the fabric overall is soft and flowy and the sleeves do not stand out off my shoulders in a weird way there is a soft flow of ruffle down both sides of the shirt the fro,1
2251,I saw this shirt online loved it but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small however retailer shirts tend to be long on me so i ordered a petite small it fits great i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long the shirt comes to my hips for reference im lbs and my measurements are,1
2252,Very happy i purchased this jacket although to me it is really a coat it fits wonderfully and is so soft i appreciate the uniqueness not the usual dull winter shades of blackgraynavy although i live in minneapolis much of the winter it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond degrees it is perfect for the inbetween degree days i am a size lbs tried the small medium the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right,1
2253,I love this dress originally ordered the medium which is my normal size especially because i am tall the arm holes were gaping and so i returned for the small the small is perfect it fits exactly as on the model and i didnt have a problem with the color being seethrough it really is so unique but so simple the color is perfect i took a single star off because it is not lined for the price this would have been nice,1
2254,Great sweater cozy and thick the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater i got a small and it fit perfectly,1
2255,Saw these in store and had to have them online pictures do not do them justice great pattern fabric and features can be dressed up or down sizing is accuratei am and lbs and bought an xs they fit perfectly wish they had more colorspatterns to purchase,1
2256,My title says it all this coat is sure to turn heads everywhere you go the colors in the coat are beautiful jewel tones and differnt then you will see anywhere it is so soft and warm and makes me feel fabulous i feel it fits tts i am short and the regular lent was fine on me get this before its gone,1
2257,The overall styling was great and the dress is supercute if a little thick its made of denim after all i ordered a size down from my normal and even then i was swimming in it the worst part and the aspect that will make me return it is that the arm holes hang down so low that id have to wear a tank top under the dress im returning it though it is really cute and i love this brand the arm holes killed it for me,0
2258,I debated buying this so glad i did tts im and c i got size and it worked but i could have done a which is my usual size i was afraid to order it too small because i needed it right away this dress is gorgeous i got the pink color way and it is more vibrant in person the beading is beautiful its incredibly soft and flowy this dress is probably my favorite dress ever if youre on the fence order it,1
2259,The color is completely off i loved the way this vest looks in the picture i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture very pale horrible,0
2260,If you are on the shorter side do with the petite size i ordered both at first petite was sold out so glad i got to get it i looked lost in the regular size the back length was well below my bum both colors are really nice but i did end up with the orange one more dressy red one looked more calsual though it is a casual shiryt i had on trousers and hte orange looked nice with them,1
2261,I normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure but it at least fit well the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short,0
2262,Tried this is my normal and it fits exactly as shown i can see how this could give issues to someone with any curves because the lining is definitely more fitted than the loose overlay especially in the bust and hips i found the quality to be very nice length was slightly above the knee on my frame so it feels workappropriate my only wish is that the colorspattern could transition better to multiple seasons it definitely feels very springy and not much else,1
2263,Very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent like and it looks like a maternity top on me i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes sadly i sent it back,0
2264,Great jacket for night time in the south this time of year very nice fabric great classic style with a little twist love retailerplogy being an older female sometimes things can look boring i love to dress in fun clothes finding something that will work for all ages and that is a little out side the lines is very nice,1
2265,I love this sweater it does run a little large though fits beautifully great for cool summer nights and early fall dress up or down,1
2266,I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small cant review anything else because i couldnt even get them on ridiculous,0
2267,Gorgeous dress fits true to size with high quality material the colors are stunning,1
2268,This is the cutest romper ever very high quality it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers but this fit beautifullyi cant wait to wear it this summer,1
2269,The print doesnt necessarily works for everybody,0
2270,Ive had this dress for a while now and waited to write a review glad i did i originally ordered the mp lbs while it looked nice accentuated my waist it was a bit big in the chest area it probably would have been ok but i am picky about fit after debating for awhile i ordered the sp and it fits much better when i pulled it out of the package i was worried it was too short but its not it hits right above my knee in fact i compared both dresses and there is not much of a diffe,1
2271,I loved this dress im and wore the small and even in heels it was a bit long i have a larger chest double d and the chest was slightly snug but otherwise fit perfectly i got compliments from everyone gorgeous dress,1
2272,These are my saucy fun jeans when the ps brought them over i wasnt sure about them but at they make the perfect ankle jean they look great with boots and are so comfy i typically wear a but i sized down in these because theyre a lower fit on me and i wanted the waist to be tight as the darling fiance says they make your derriere look great id snag these on sale,1
2273,This is a great little top a wonderful basic but the crochetlace detail adds the perfect amount of uniqueness its a soft jersey material that doesnt cling falls very nicely over the body flowy without being too flowy i ordered my usual small and it fits tts for reference im lbs and d bust i did not order the petite since i have a longer torso very happy i orderer a regular small will be a great spring and summer top,1
2274,I bought navy in my usual size s and the color and fit are exactly as pictured very good quality cotton the pocket can lay funny on the hips but a little adjustments does the trick i wore this chemise at home and hubby noticed it never happens i wore it to study in coffee shop with boots and scarf and felt comfortable warm and stylish great staple well made and well priced,1
2275,I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body i love the bottom of it it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back add an ada wrap belt and perfection,1
2276,Beautiful dress it looks fresh feminine and the quality of the fabric is very nice,1
2277,A beautiful comfortable dress with its own unique style a must to add to your wardrobe,1
2278,The colors are so pretty a pinkish brown and a light brown trim it is very soft and elegant looking great with jeans or leggings the tie is a little high in back but looks great highly recommend,1
2279,I had the seafolly garden suit last year same cut and loved it i decided the light blue color didnt look great on me so i decided to get this one i found that the garden suit was cut smaller than this umbrella print one right now im a m and got the in this just like last time i probably couldve gotten the but ill keep the for comfort note the leg holes are not tight and do not make upper thighsbutt squish out like you might imagine try this suit,1
2280,I found this at my retailer storethe only dress left i bought this in black in my usual size small this dress was so pretty on and fabulous in hot weather the material is gauzy and so the look is casual im not sure i would wear it in the evening but the fit was great i am tall and the dress is long enough for me i would say it is the same length as on the model it is a bit pricey for what it is but i bought it as a birthday gift to myself,1
2281,What a wonderful find yes it runs big and beautiful love the quality and design very light and airy this is great for me because im not short i am busty i love tunics this item can be dressed up or played down with class the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment i am usually to busy to write a review but i felt obligated on this item five stars,1
2282,I love this dress so much the perfect summer dress comfortable easy to travel with and i get compliments on it all the time,1
2283,If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you beyond unflattering boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade,0
2284,I so wanted to love this top i ordered the blue which is blue and orange i thought the orange would be brighter it is not it is a dull color also im usually a medium this top fits fine on my shouldersbust c but it was huge around the waist making me look a lot larger if this top were a bit smaller around the waist i would keep it but it is going back,0
2285,I was a little nervous to purchase this top as there were no previous reviews but it intrigued me especially with the sale price i love it i am and got the small it hits just atbelow my knee in the front and a few inches above my ankle in the back it is perfect with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings what makes it go from a frumpy tunic to a cute flowy top is the slits up the side a beautiful touch the neck is very high almost a cross between a turtle neck and a hooded look i l,1
2286,I admit i have a soft spot for a most anything from maeve this dress is no exception i had overlooked it online due to the white shirt they show with it online but the material design tex are great the colors are very me and i can see this being a great fall winter and early spring dress the material is very soft i have sensitive skin and i love the little pop of color that the front piece adds the only draw back for me is the lack of pockets and it runs big i got this on sale so siz,1
2287,I love the design and color of this jacket when i saw it pictured i thought it was a vest the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacketi ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer this jacket runs smaller the sleeves were very tight and overall it was just too small had to return it,1
2288,This is my fourth amadi piece from retailer i love their signature fitted crossover top design which i am finding in many of their pieces like the lola jumpsuit crossfront lola dress and others this dress has the same crossover top design with a slim maxi silhouette the fabric is rayon and nylon with a neat texture that doesnt come through on the product photo but adds to its appeal in my opinion because it hides wrinkles it fits tts and the same as the other amadi pie,1
2289,I love these jeans they actually look better than the picture and you cannot beat the sale price they are a boyfriend fit but you can order your normal size usually with boyfriends i have to order one to two sizes down with skinnies and more fitted jeans i am a and thats what i got there is no sagging or stretching out after wearing them for a while the wash is absolutely beautifulvery worn hopefully the holes in the knees wont get even bigger i have worn and washed them now q,1
2290,Love this dress accents your curves and slims you waist,1
2291,I am not a onepiece body type this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the perfect length of shorts drapey fabric not clingy asymmetrical cut of the top highly recommend,1
2292,This tank is perfect it fits close to the body but does not squeeze it is super soft smooth and comfy it layers perfectly under blouses this is by far my favorite basic tank,1
2293,I love the fit of the peplum top its flattering without being too full on the bottom the print is lovely and great for summer and spring,1
2294,I ordered this bra in my normal size d and it fits me perfectly this bra is beautiful the material seems to be very high quality and the comfort of this bra is amazing its definitely a keeper,1
2295,This dress is amazing love the fit quality and design so unique and is perfect for dressing up or down wore it to a wedding and plan on wearing it to work also im a tall girl and this dress was such a good length for me no one likes a dress thats too short i ordered a size and it fit perfectly around the waist and chest,1
2296,I was able to get this on sale when it arrived it was missing half of the rhinestones i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way it also was missing the little bag with extra stones im reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse any help from anyone would be appreciated i hate to part with this but where was quality control,0
2297,I love an item of clothing that i am able to justify its purchase by knowing it is unlike any other piece in my closet this skirt definitely fits that desirethe material looks almost like the colors were felted onto the dark background creating a wearable art piece very vibrant colors the material itself is somewhat stiff and maintains its structure when on i needed to wear a size im sometimes a sometimes a with a waist measurement of and the skirt sits at the smallest part,1
2298,I didnt realize that the grey sleeves are attached i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made will be returning,0
2299,I love this blouse its a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as its a bit sheer and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately but is still functional the decorative part fell off they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters ill sew that one oni absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is i didnt realize it was dry clean only but that doesnt bother me,1
2300,Perfect fit can be dressed up or down more colors please,1
2301,Definitely a curve hugger i bought the summer version of this dress sleeveless white with black stripes earlier this year and it was my go to dress all season long was very excited to see a fallwinter version to pair with tights and boots bought a medium again and it fits great this is a very flattering dress and the material is lightweight yet substantial and forgiving of flaws,1
2302,This sweater is beautiful not only is the lace front gorgeous but it is incredibly comfortable and so well crafted definitely my favorite cardigan now,1
2303,This jacket has cute details i like the front pockets and color it has no shape and is about size bigger than marked i felt like a sack of potatoes in it,0
2304,I really fell in love with this shirt i am about and pounds i ordered xxs which that was a good size from the chest but this shirt is literally so wide i was ready to fly although the model wears this shirt really nicely i think this shirt is made for a certain type of body not quite sure what that is also this shirt is shorter than what i expected it looks a lot longer on the model i had to return this shirt,0
2305,I think the model photo doesnt do this dress justice its comfortable and perfect for a summery day i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan and of course it works well causally im busty d on a small frame but theres not gapping the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish,1
2306,Sweater fits great and is nice and soft i am and got a m and the arms and length are perfect for me,1
2307,Love this dress its sooo pretty i happened to find it in a store and im glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc its petite i bought a petite and am i love the length on me hits just a little below the knee would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite,1
2308,I really loved this dress in the store when i tried it on the color and fabric were perfect for summer but once i got this home i noticed the placket wouldnt lay flat across the bust like shown in pictures when i went up a size it was too large under the arms so this one will sadly have to go back to the store,0
2309,Fits like a dream i have a thick middle and tend to have problems with anything that flairs out so i was so happy that it hung beautifully on me even though i wasnt really looking for a sweater to take on a trip to europe in a few weeks i bought it on the spot i bought it in neutral which is the only color the store had and after seeing the darker color am happy with it i love the belt since most sweaters dont have anything to close them and the belt lays perfectly as well,1
2310,I love this shirt it was a great price and very high quality it has different material stitched in the inside,1
2311,The stone color was nice but the material is heavy and doesnt breath if you are partial to more natural fabrics i would go with a different item upside would be that i imagine this shirt will last,0
2312,This is awesome multiseason dress,1
2313,Beautiful jacket for a light day fits a little large so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look order down a size,1
2314,I love flowy pants like these pattern looks different the green is pale like on the far right smocking is a beautiful touch and they are a nice weight and well made had to hem them up about and im about xl fits perfectly,1
2315,Absolutely love this dress i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline but flipped it around for an evening night out cant recommend it enough two of my colleagues ordered it that day,1
2316,This top is very cute it is a high low top that i wasnt expecting but love it the picture doesnt do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus will get a lot of wear out of this top,1
2317,Soft fabric and hangs nicely washes well purchased in the orange red and love with jeans,1
2318,Got the mustard and grey very cute looking forward to wearing it,1
2319,I did not notice this dress on the website it was not until i saw it in store was an online purchase returned i was immediately in love i love the color texture and rosettes i feel like a million bucks wearing it and have received so many compliments on it before buying it i actually ran home to gather a previous purchase and return it so i could buy this dress and not feel guilty i am usually a or and the fits perfect through and through so happy with this lovely dress,1
2320,For anyone who loves lace it fits pretty true to size the size m length hits just to the top of the knee i tall to lighten up the dress just a little so that it does not look as some have said frumpy i hemmed the liner so that the liner hem is half way up on the ruffle this makes the dress look less heavy more fun and repeats the openness of the lace on top love this dress will be wore a lot for summer evenings out,1
2321,So sad becuase i like the design i would not recomend the lack to anyone that does not live and work and shop in a completely immaculate environment i wore this to work the day after purchasing and within three hours i honestly looked like i had slept in this sweater for three monthe straight i had to take the sweater off and work in a tshirt the marigold color may be better than the black abut showing lint but something intrinsic to the fabric really attracts lint like nothing i have eve,0
2322,I absolutely love everything about this dress it can be dressed up or down no complaints,1
2323,This is an absolutely gorgeous dress i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full but this one is just too voluminous also the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric so disappointed the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too this can be worn year round with sandals or boots,1
2324,The color and quality of this sweater are fantastic the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck didnt seem right to me it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneckcowl i will be returning the sweater because of that,0
2325,Wow great top i have all the colors now wow like them all great weight cozy but not too heavy nice that no pilling either love it,1
2326,This is a wonderful top the fabric is soft and comfortable with a beautiful drape the pattern is very pretty the curved hems are very flattering and the top is versatile it can be worn with shorts as shown or a skirt with a belt or pants i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange yellow and green and this top looked amazing with all of them a great little find,1
2327,I am in love with this dress and cant wait to wear it to brunch this weekend i am normally a ps but they only had the pxs which i took a chance on fits like a glove slightly tight in the chest area but i am chesty for a petite girl the length is perfect and modest the detail up front is adorable,1
2328,I absolutely am obsessed with this poncho it is the perfect piece for fall and so easy to layer,1
2329,I think this fits to true to size i am and lbs i always wear a xs it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra b if i wore a normal very little padding bra it did not pull much across the bust,1
2330,Its always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee love the color and they way it was pieced together has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual its slightly sheer but not obscene all linen and a little scratchy so if youre sensitive be aware i purchased medium and im,1
2331,This is what id been looking for without even knowing it its long without being too long and most importantly its soft not scratchy the way so many winter clothes can be i wasnt sure if i should order the small or the medium so i went with the medium and it fits great the weave is just slightly wide but not to the point where you have to wear a cami or tee underneath but the fit is loose enough that you can if you want to for added warmth i really like it,1
2332,This sweater was exactly what i was looking forsomething well made cozy easy to just throw on and go and still look chic i am and lbs and the xsmall fit perfectly still roomy but drapes well i got the taupe which is nice but i got the red color for my sister in law and its gorgeous more of a burnt orange than the red show here i would definitely recommend this sweater,1
2333,First i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short because well it is that being said it is a perfect length for someone who is petite like me i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets which tend to make my short body look like a blob i love the length or shortness of this jacket aside from that it fits true to size is wonderfully warm and cozy and makes me feel fabulous when im wearing it it is my new favorite jacket,1
2334,This sweater is a must have for fall super comfy yet stylish fit make it fun to dress up or down i plan on wearing it with leggings and high boots,1
2335,I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small for me its not true at all i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable but it was simply too short rather than as it states on the website its more like which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person i dont even want to go regular size because it wouldve been too big i saw some photos that others po,0
2336,Adorable true to size and just as pictured there is no hook and eye clasp as stated but still cute light weight and will be perfect over dresses and summer tanks wish there were additional colors i love the white though,1
2337,So comfy and well made perfect to dress up or down bought one and coming back for several more cut a bit low in arms lace bralette is perfect under bought a small length and fit similar to model,1
2338,Soooooo cute fit like a dream look like regular pants could dress up or dress down i bought the grey and the slight herringbone pattern was so adorable going to buy in the black as well normally wear size got the small and fits perfect,1
2339,This is the tiniest blazer ive ever purchased in a size i usually wear an but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small its very attractive but please size true to size,0
2340,I ordered the yellow i love this shirt it such a happy print can match a lot of things,1
2341,I bought these in my usual size and they were much too loose so i returned them i definitely need a inch hips low waist waist i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size in pants even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy frame they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model if you are shorter i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look the material is not bright white wi,1
2342,Such a pretty skirt i think its a very versatile piece a bit heavier cant wait to wear when it cools down more i saw the dress that is similar to the skirt in the catalog last month and loved it too note the skirt does not have the same shine in the fabric that the dress does,1
2343,Tried this on in the store and fell in love its such a simple shirt but the details are special runs tts will get a lot of use out of this,1
2344,Usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top possibly better on smaller chests the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs going back,0
2345,I liked this blouse very much the minute i first seen it it looks exactly as pictured but sits much better in person im ft tall lb ordered a which was true to size with a little more room to the bottom i was able to see my belly button through the sheer part of the bottom fabric but as soon as i sucked my belly in it was fine the quality of the fabric is soso i had some threads hanging out here and there but this top looks very good in person and the design is unique you can hav,1
2346,My measurements im a b so i got the medium it fits perfectly i originally purchased this in the gray to wear during the day in winter months but i loved it so much that i came back and purchased the black for evenings with skinny jeans and heels its so soft and pretty can be dressed up or down and now im thinking about getting the wine color too i love it i washed it in coldgentle and let it air dry and it held up fine i wouldnt push it though treat it delicately its a smar,1
2347,I was really pleased with this skirt the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me but this fit perfectly in my regularl size,1
2348,Such a cute take on a henleybutton down shirt i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversizedtunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look im just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks yea these shirts are so soft and made of substan,1
2349,I normally wear a large or extralarge the medium is still very billowy on me this blouse is ethereal and lovely though pretty and funky at the same time its sheer but somehow not revealing perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer,1
2350,This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk i received many compliments when i wore this with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry the fit is true to size i took my usual size l it is longer on me than the model and my only complaint is the slipit is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together so i had to find a different slip i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer i dont,1
2351,As always these ag stevies are perfect i was worried they would run small but they are true to size on me im about and ordered the petite length and the length looks like the model on me just above the ankles,1
2352,In agreement with all the reviewers before me this dress is gorgeousi am lbs a and got this is in a size and it fits perfectly but i would be in a little bit of trouble if i were significantly larger up top so if you are definitely size upthe material is thick structured and very well made every time i wear this out i get a ton of complimentsone of my favorite parts about it is the intricate embroidery on the neckline that gives the illusion that you are wearing a necklac,1
2353,Love this dress i ordered the blue for some color and it is nicer in person than in the photo the fabric and color are beautiful can dress this up or wear for work i am lbs and and got the size xs petite it is a loose fit but not too loose very unique dress that i can wear all fall and winter,1
2354,I first spotted this on an retailer employee she paired it with a peasant top wore it open wjeans boots so darn cute love how this peice transitions from summer to fall im so i had to order the small petite which is perfect note that this dress is very long its just a must have garment the colors print are just beautiful,1
2355,Ive been searching for a pretty soft faux fur coat finally found it hanging there in retailer there was only one a size small it looked gorgeous but thought i could use it a bit roomier im a size about lbs i ordered a medium but it was huge stayed with the small and am loving wearing this in our mild northeast winter lots of compliments lightweight and luxe get it,1
2356,For the price of this dress i was expecting something decent the style is cute but nothing more however the type of the polyester that the dress is made of oh my it is a thick unpleasant material that will cling to a body when it is hot i never came across an item at retailer that was made this cheaplythe tag on the back was hanging at half and the button on the front was ready to come off before i even tried this dress onno need to say its going back asapyou should not sel,0
2357,This blouse fits true to size i carry alot of weight in my mid section and this blouse easily covers and hides my mid section where im not having to tug or pull down i have this blouse in the olive green in xl and it fits perfect i wore this on christmas with my family,1
2358,I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item,0
2359,This sweater is so comfy and classic it balances a quirky handknit look with a beautiful color and practical fit it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style and as others mentioned there are gaps in the knit that make it seethrough in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering i like having a longer camisole showing underneath or wearing it over a little dress its warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat,1
2360,This is a dress for a princess i admire this dress so much online and in person i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store the beads throughout the dress provide a lowkey surprise sparkle especially in the sun the colors are much more vibrant in person which is breathtaking against the light cream background the fabric is soft and flowy unfortunately for me it doesnt fit right size fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy,1
2361,Im lbs and d i ordered a p and it fits perfectly the color is more of a bronze mixed with gold and chocolate the picture does not do it justice,1
2362,I loved this shirt when i got it it fit perfectly and was so soft but when i washed it following the instructions it shrank up to well above my belly button im talking inches of shrinkage at least,0
2363,Im and lbs d and the size m is perfect i will probably wear a thin long cami under it as it is slightly see through it doesnt gape under the arms like some sleeveless itemsit fits smoothly as the other review mentioned it would be a perfect swim suit cover up but im going to wear it more as a casual very versatile perfect for a hot day summer dress,1
2364,I am very happy with this suit it is gorgeous and very well made my only suggestion is to use your normal swimsuit size when ordering rather than their recommendations i am a in dress size but am curvy with a large bust i went with a medium because i thought there was no way i would wear a small the medium actually fits great in the waist and bottom however is small in the top for me im ordering a large to compare coverage,1
2365,I was so disappointed with the quality of this dress especially because it looks so beautiful on the model the fabric was so thin that after one hand wash its already developing a tiny hole and pilling also it is definitely not a day dressi wore it as a swim coverup but it is much too thin and pajamalike to be worn as an actual dress the color is much different in personthe blue is brighter and for lack of a better way to describe it cheap looking the white banding around the t,0
2366,Ive been searching for wide leg trousers for what seems like years and finally i have found themand on salei agree that these trousers are long for ladies of average height i am fairly tall and the length is perfect for me i dont anticipate that i will have them hemmedi really love the detail of the tie waist one could wear these with or without the ribbon belt i would say that the button closures are a bit less than substantial for the quality and weight of the fabrici s,1
2367,I bought this shirt yesterday for off the sale price i usually wear a m the store only had s and i didnt want to pay for shipping so i bought the smaller size it was loose through the body tight in the arms you could size down if you need to but if you have large arms i would get your normal size or get one larger the arm fabric does not have much give the shirt dips low in the front and back so it has ample coverage for your mid section it also would accommodate just about any,1
2368,Beautiful shorts im lbs and athleticmuscular build the fit perfect which is my true size great print that will go with plenty of different colors i feel like you can dress it up or go more casual,1
2369,Wow wow wow this is so retailer the dress is more breathtaking in person it is a beautiful work of art from top to bottom the fabric is super soft and flows perfectly the lining is super soft as well and it doesnt fall all the way down to the hem so that the burnout detail would show through on the bottom i dont like spaghetti straps but the straps are very sturdy and high quality very comfortable fyi the color is much richer a shade darker in person like an eggplant color i orde,1
2370,The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty th fabric is a soft tshirt martial i ordered a medium and it fits like a large it is supposed to be flowy and loose though overall i feel beautiful in it great for our hot humid charleston summers,1
2371,This dress is everything i wanted it to be i bought it to wear to a winter wedding and the material is perfect for that i initially ordered it in a regular and ended up having to exchange it for a petite and it fits absolutely perfectly the detailing on the shoulder is beautiful,1
2372,This skirt manages to be both sophisticated and whimsical its wellmade classy feminine and timeless love it,1
2373,I ordered the mustard shade in size xl it is so wellmade comfortable the patterned lining makes it extra cute and extra soft to wear its washed well too i like the shorter length it it fun to play with proportions when using it i ordered the navy in xl since ive gotten such great use out of the yellow one it hasnt shedpilled either wellmade quirky and useful for layering,1
2374,I didnt think much of this tank while perusing sale items on the website but after reading the reviews i decided to order it and it did not disappoint i ordered the green which is more vibrant inperson than on the website and i wore it the next day which is always a good sign i loved it so much i quickly ordered the white too it is flattering stylish and comfortable an excellent combination i highly recommend this tank as a summer staple it goes with everything,1

2376,This is a super comfortable and flattering dress and i get compliments every time i wear it highly recommend,1
2377,This tunic is a perfect length for leggings the mauve color got rave reviews on my first wearing and the mixed media and asymmetrical styling gave the garment a unique appeal and made it quite flattering however when i wore it a second time i noticed two micro holes in the sleeve one near my wrist and the other at the shoulder since i take extreme care when laundering my clothes it seems this will have to be a return as the jersey knit is not strong enough to hold up in the delicate cycl,0
2378,I kept coming back to look at this vest for the color and design and finally gave in vest is my favorite when dress layer i hesitate because no descriptions about the model height the vest may look perfect on her and look like a maxi dress on my body it turned out just fine the front is below my knees like the picture of the model i love the beautiful red and the material that stretches just enough for my arms to move around this is definitely a good buy,1
2379,I love this brand i literally live in their tops this one is a bit of a disappointment it is made out of fabric that feels cheap reminding me of a tissue tee instead of the normal thicker quality of all their other products its very thin and see through unless wearing a camisoleslip underneath you have to have the perfect bra and pants situation going on underneath no muffin tops or back fati got the black and am keeping it only because i love the design need a black top desperat,0
2380,I created a summer capsule wardrobe for travel and this tshirt dress fits in with my collection perfectly it is well made super soft and comfortable launders well and does not require ironing it is substantial enough to provide coverage across the posterior and the cap sleeves and length are fabulous for visiting sacred places and dining out or as a beach coverup i love that you can simply throws this on and go or dress it up with a belt add a scarf or kimono or a jacket and voila,1
2381,This elegant tank made me feel as if i had been transported to downton abbey the velvet trim and the lovely embellishments of sparkle have an art deco delight the swing of the fabric was playful and flattering its easy to dress up and dress down fantastic top,1
2382,Pretty design and good quality but the medium was very balloony at the bottom fit my chest alright c but flared out way too much at the bottom,0
2383,I dont know how this dress doesnt have more of a following its really perfect i will say i am tall and lanky the dress is oversized but not overly so drapes beautifully and will work for any season fabric is divine i plan to wear this to work for travel on weekends etc love the creamdeep charcoal color at the sale price this really is a great versatile find,1
2384,I absolutely love these shorts i do however feel they run on the large side i am and normally wear a or and bought these in an xs i would have gotten an xxs if they were available but that was not an option they are a little baggy but they are so great i could not pass them up these are too good to pass on,1
2385,The appliqu on this dress is well done i would recommend it to anyone the design is super flattering and feminine,1
2386,I purchased this jacket in green xsmall a while back and wasnt sure about it due to the size im lbs and a a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it recently i purchased the black xsmall and this i love its looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops i do recommend both jackets they are pricey for what,1
2387,This tunic only barely resembles the photo in personfirst the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photossecond its huge im and typically wear or p in retailerpolgies shirtsdresses i ordered the sp and the dress was at least times wider than it needed to be it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless and the style doesnt really lend itself to use with a belt,0
2388,I was not impressed with this dress online but when i tried it on at the store i fell in love its a great summer fall dress i love the sweater top and linen bottom so many compliments on it,1
2389,These beauties offer such sweet respite from lowrise skinny jeans hallelujah absolutely love the high waist and elongated line im and the are a great fit very slimming and already ive dressed them down with an offtheshoulder top and wedge espadrilles and dressed them up with a silk blouse and heels the design is very retrofabulous the quality top notch love these and look forward to having them as a forever staple in my denim repertoire ive been searching far and wid,1
2390,I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors like another reviewer within a few weeks having worn them no more than a couple of times the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes i was not hard on the pants just wore them to the office and line dried them so disappointing as i really did love the pants total waste of money,0
2391,Im not a western girl but this dress is so adorable i love the colors its adorable and unique while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i didnt find it overly large i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket,1
2392,Ditto what the first reviewer said unfortunately i was so looking forward to receiving this dress but the one received is not the one in the photos the graphics are fantastic still love the boats but the top is not the same and theyve added a fabric belt to the finished dress the fit was perfect except for gapping under the arms similar i suspect to what the first reviewer reported i was also surprised by the fabric based on the photos i was expecting something light and semi trans,0
2393,I love this dress the fabric is a little heavy so it wont blow away on a windy day and bonus even with my triple d chest im comfortable not wearing a bra with this but may not be what you want to wear on a really hot day the shape is flattering on any body typei am months pregnant and it still looks great it can go from spring to summer to fall quite easily with the addition of a jean jacket and some converse or vans instead of sandals id absolutely recommend this dress,1
2394,Thee are beautiful pants so soft to the touch true to color cat wait to wear them in the fall,1
2395,Worth every single penny size up they are very tight,1
2396,I received my coat today in love it is so flattering in so many ways it may not be form fitting but i love all the details and im a sucker for hoods this is a great fallwinter coat especially if you live in the south it will probably only work as a late springearly fall coat for you northern ladies my only compliant is that the arms are too long but im only so itll possibly be the perfect fit for someone else,1
2397,These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect ladies if you have thick legsthese jean are meant for you,1
2398,I ordered the peachivorytan version in size xl and i love everything about this dress im size xl and a pearshape so dresses can be hit or miss this one is a favorite its so soft the mix of colors and the sizing of the stripespleats is flattering its nice being more fitted on top flowy through the bottom i love this dress so much im having fun pairing different combos of necklaces vests pins belts boots with it ill get good use out of this through spring comfortable pret,1
2399,I love the design of the suit and decided to take a chance and order despite the mixed reviews im so happy i did i couldnt be happier with the fit quality and design for reference i am size and smaller chested small b cup and went with a medium i could see that this suit might not work for everyone but i love it,1
2400,This shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected had to send it back,0
2401,These pants are gorgeousthe fabric has a satiny stretch that simply feels decadent on i tried on the size and and though they both fit the size was more flattering im lbs compared to cartonniers capris which i love and wear a size in the fabric and construction on these is superior and the color is knockout red,1
2402,These leggings are some of the softest i own i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove,1
2403,Bought these in both moss and navy fits perfect love the style and the rolldown waist excellent qualitybought the peachy color topwith the elephants to wear with the moss colored one and received lots of compliments,1
2404,When i was purchasing this i asked to myself do i really need another black jacket when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket this jacket is special it is light weight but structured it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing this jacket is my new favorite,1
2405,Very comfy versatile skirt the fabric is soft and stretchy that feels really nice on i live in hawaii so i like having skirts to wear that work well with the climate but not typical of the fashion out here the pleating is very flattering and the skirt layer underneath makes it wearable to work,1
2406,This is a great dress it definitely runs true to size and is on the border of running a little small if youre on the fence about which size to order go with the larger sizethe fabric moves nicely but wrinkles easily when packed love the colorgot a ton of compliments,1
2407,I loved the look and style of the dress but was unsure how it would work with my body im curvy but slim and usually a size or in retailer i went with the m in the navy color and im happy i did the floral pattern is vibrant and the ruffled skirt is flirty and fun as far as fit goes id say this runs mostly true to size but is rather short in length i have a large chest so the top part looked more baggy than blousy and the skirt portion was just comfortably fitted however the cuten,1
2408,After reading the reviews i placed an order because it was the only top that caught my eye on the entire price downs lately all my usual l sizes from retailer turn out huge so i ordered a size smaller from what i usually wear all would have been ok if the top wasnt so darn short for reference im ft tall lb its weird that this top looks completely the opposite of the model on the photo from a loose looking fit with longer sleeves looking like a stylized sweatshirt that is not what,0
2409,This is an absolutely gorgeous sweater the colors are just as they appear online but the length stated for the petite version is way off i suspected as much from the picture but decided to try it anyway the petite small went down to my ankles too bad i would have loved this sweater if it were an abovetheknee or even atknee length,1
2410,Hahahathis dress is hilarious it looks nothing like the image i am usually a xs and was the smallest size available so i ordered it when i opened it it felt like lbs of fabric i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress once i looked in the mirror i almost fell over laughing the rest of the dress is huge i dont believe this dress would be flattering on anyone,0
2411,Im and pounds this top is beautiful its high neck is so flattering a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes i purchased a small and it is a little longer but since it has elastic at the waist its no problem i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts the arm holes are perfect the as far as it being a lot of blouse i didnt find that at all but i am busty c or d depending on brand of bra the color is ivory omits completely sheer no lin,1
2412,There is some confusion in the first few reviews over the image but the dress has a medium green lace and does not have a cut out at the front of the neck it runs more true to size than some dresses at antrho my size is a small petite meaning that i often end up in a and the six is perfect the dress hangs gorgeously and fits fabulously the zipper is a bit hard to get through the seams and lace but worth itit has a formal feel but i think it can be made casual with shoes a,1
2413,I want this in every color fits ttsso comfortable flattering and fabric feels like it will hold up well fingers crossed love love love,1
2414,I first saw this online and as a longtime wearer of vests this really caught my eye once it came into the store i was able to try it on in grey small and it was perfection it just wasnt in the budget so i decided to wait for it to go on sale and watch the website every day we have stores in my area and when it got down to only having limited availability for a small i sprang into action the largest store had put it on the almost gone rack and they had only smalls i tried them,1
2415,Thrilled this statement piece is back i get so many compliments on this and its practical as well for our cold minnesota winters highly recommend,1

2420,Most comfortable and great looking i got complements from everyone literally,1
2421,The pictures dont do this cardi justice its so lovely and ladylike its seems very well made please can we have more from this designer,1
2422,I love swing tops the more swingy the better this top is so fun its a little hard to tell online but its made of two fabrics most of the fabric is a thin tshirt material and then theres a panel on one side thats more of a silky fabric its so so cool the colors are just as they appear online and the print is fun and edgy i have larger arms so i love the length of the sleeves the other reviewer said it was cropped but i did not have that experience in fact i was able to wear mine w,1
2423,This coat is gorgeous the minute i saw it online i ordered as fast as i can typewhen it arrived it exceeded my expectations in every waythe lace detail is exquisite and the fit is so flatteringi have the beatrice coat of last year and i so love it and this is equally beautifula must for retailer shoppers i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection,1
2424,I disagree with the other reviewer i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality and while it wasnt lined i dont think lining is typical in a sweater material i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape i usually wear a or but my store only had a available it fit but was a little tight in the hips the skirt was also longer on me then on the model but im on the short side,1
2425,I ordered christmas presents online this year they arrived very quickly and were well received they are ferry pretty i will order online again,1
2426,This unique blouse is very comfortable and looks beautiful on the body it flowy and flattering and looks great with my tan dress up or down its a staple in my summer wardrobe,1
2427,I saw this in store and had to try it on it is really cute i love the different textures and the red drawstrings it fits well although i am somewhat between the small and medium sizes i went with the medium in case i want to wear a bulky sweater with it really cute and i have never seen a coat like it,1
2428,You know how you hope that a dress that you order online is as good as you think it will be well this one is better then i had hoped it fits beautifully it is crafted beautifully there is nothing i dont like about it i was pleasantly surprised at how light the fabric is i thought it might be a heavier denim but it is perfect not so light that you can see through it but cool and breezy even in the florida heat do yourself a favor and grab this one before its gone,1
2429,These fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky no way,0
2430,So happy this came back into stock beautiful trench love the flared skirt the coat is perfect for the warming weather here on the east coast it adds elegance and sophistication to any outfit a must,1
2431,I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online i jumped at the opportunity i am slender and always wear a small in retailer tops i purchased this in the mint size small and as soon as i opened the bag i had doubts the fabric is terrible thin and scratchy it is not soft and supple as i had imagined the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the,0
2432,This dress is perfect for me im very bohemianrocker vs prim flowy vs structured it will be in regular rotation for years its slim through the shoulders and arms and flowing everywhere else love the pockets the fabric is light but i love in so cal so its great im wearing it right now with gray skinnies heeled clogs and a scarf ill also wear it all summer as a dress so perfect im lb b and the fits perfectly,1
2433,Yes it runs very large i usually wear a m and ordered the xss i like the oversize fit and i think this poncho is unique chic and modern definitely worth the price especially on sale very nice quality fabric,1
2434,Ive only worn the sweater a handful of times but im already in love with how soft and comfortable it is its a bit on the baggier side but that doesnt stop it from looking great ive gotten complements on it every time ive worn it i would highly recommend it to people who dont like the typical scratchyitchy textiles,1
2435,I tried it on at store and went back to buy it once it hit the sale rack not the kind of dress that grabbed my attention online but once i put it on i knew that it would find a way to my closet the fabric is high quality and there is lots of it the color the weight the pockets i love everything about it i see how it might not work for everyone but for me lb b xs is a great fit,1
2436,Love this tank the purple motif is gorgeous and the carbon color is a rich dark gray with a slight blue tinge at with a fairly proportionate torso to leg ratio i sometimes need a petite in tops like this to avoid the armholes being too long in this top i found the petite small too short but the regular small was perfect the waist hits right above my natural waist the hem is just a skosh lower than the model photo and the armholes are the right length beautiful flattering cu,1
2437,This is an amazing top fits perfectly beautiful detail and amazing fabric i actually came back to the site just so i could order it in all available colors but unfortunately its only in navy dont hesitate to buy this,1
2438,Ordered this online in a petite im fits very nicely but for the amount of fabric this dress has layers total i think a p will be a better choice and not look as full maybe a little more fitted which will be more attractive at the top on mehowever the detailing on the dress is really beautiful and high quality the dress has quite a bit of weight to it with the top swingy layer a tulle like layer for shape and then the sheath like slip the colors are all very dark,1
2439,A good part of my closet is filled with retailer clothes i mix them with my basics scarves and jewelry so i immediately thought of a dozen ways this kimono could jazz up anything from skinny jeans to slip dresses even though i felt it was pretty pricey when it arrived i was more than disappointed in the cheapness of the fabric it does nothing for any of my intended clothes so it is going back asap,0
2440,This top looks even better in person the green is a little brighter than the photo this beautiful blouse is silk with a sold underlining it is very full and has great flow and movement super trendy with the open shoulders and a nice long sleeve for fall its really beautiful and perfect for any festive occasion,1
2441,I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot i typically wear an xs or s and purchased the small glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth its a little low cut for me but ill wear a cami under it,1
2442,I was going to order a size online but decided to check my local store first hate paying for shipping especially when so many retailers offer free shipping regardless of the purchase amount all that was left was a and i decided to go ahead and try the just for size comparison im usually a size but this dress fit perfect in the a probably would have been ok but may have been a bit looser in the top i love the lace fabric on the top and the contrast it provides to the skir,1
2443,I bought one pair last year and two more this year i love them they fit tts and the red ones look exactly like the picturemore of a pink color super cute color buy these shorts,1
2444,This dress is one of a kind i saw it on sale and immediately snatched it for a very reasonable price i could not be happier ive already had the chance to wear it at an event and felt like miss mary from downton abby very classy and elegant,1
2445,This is the reason i doggedly fight for items at retailer as there are often maybe made in my xxspyou really have to see this in person even the slip could be worn as a chemise alone with the double layer and dots the colors are gorgeous i wanted this to try with my burgundy velvet blazer and it works withe the copper color too the dress is really a swing shape not close fitting no waistline so it is very comfortable the sleeves are fitted but stretchy so should not be a,1
2446,This very unique dress is exquisite and so versatile suitable for daytime or evening and will look great with a cardigan and tights for yearround wear it fits perfectly and seems true to size to me im about pounds and got an xs the description says the dress can be machine washed but with the delicate trim around the neckline i plan to handwash it carefully so happy with this purchase,1
2447,I tried this dress at a store today and ended up ordering it online i tried the red which is a beautiful vibrant color i wasnt sure how it looked on my skin tone though pale like death so i ordered the black i do believe it runs small in the chest and shoulders i am normally a size in shirts but the buttons were straining over my chest and my shoulders felt constricted i tried the and it was plenty roomy for reference i am a c with athletic shoulders overallprosan,1
2448,Very cheap looking material looks cheap to cost,0
2449,I typically wear a in jeans and in these i got the and they fit perfectly i ordered the because i wanted a more fitted look and that was what i got they are well made a nice dark wash and with the size a more straight fit and not boyfriend fit im only so they come a little past my ankle when unrolled ive worn them two days in a row and they havent stretched outhighly recommend,1
2450,I love the cut of this dress i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design so i would say stick with your usual size amazing pop of color especially for summer the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it are wonderful do yourselves a favor and just try it on,1
2451,I just received this in the wine color and its gorgeous it fits well and is very pretty it can be dressed up or down i cant wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this i have already ordered the other color great purchase,1
2452,I order this sweater in black size small and i just love it im a slender lbs and the small is perfect in for me while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized boyfriend feel to it the rounded front hem hip pockets and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem where the rounded hem begins are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailers clothing the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality but it is perfect for my minneapol,1
2453,This top looks elegant with my stirrup pants and feels like heaven it is so soft fitted at the neck and arms loose and swingy at the trunk with a beautifully finished hem the yarn is twotoned heather,1
2454,This brand always makes the softest tees and so i buy several each season when i saw this one online i worried that it might be too long for my short waist but i decided to order it anyway success i ordered my usual size m for knit tops in fitted ones and the length was perfect due to the buttons on the sidefyi short waist broad shouldersback c i carry my weight in the middle since i virtually do not have a waistline so a longer boxy tee will emphasize the parts of,1
2455,This dress is so flattering and comfortable i bought it in xs and it fits perfectly im and weigh i usually wear a small but the small would have been too roomy on top i got so many compliments on the dress in blue that i ordered it in green as well perfect combination of comfort style and flattering fit,1
2456,Ordered online and when it came i was very excited to open it but the photo doesnt show how incredibly wide the cut is it is also quite cropped and looked very awkward on me the embroidery is lovely but the style doesnt work i had a small but the area in the shoulders was cut very tight and it would not have worked well if i wanted to raise or lower my arms above shoulder height might work better on someone with a more petite frame but i do caution how voluminous the cut,0

2461,Love love the fit and material a must fall wardrobe,1
2462,I bought the silvery blue tunic it is very light grey with a hint of blue it is so shapely coverage without being boxy or maternitylike it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans the color can really take you through autumn winter and even spring depending on where you live i love the sleeve length too,1
2463,I wanted these jeans so badly i originally ordered them in my regular size a they were too big even for a tomboy fit so i ordered a the size order was backordered and then cancelled i am so sad i would absolutely buy these if i could get them in my size they are so soft and beautiful i love ags quality,1
2464,What a nice sweater i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters ive gotten in a long time the fit is true to size the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing the weight is perfect for every season i am very happy with everything about this sweater,1

2469,I ordered a small and it is enormous i usually wear a size it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler also it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the s im sending it back,0
2470,I purchased this tee last week in white and love it as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does perfect light weight easy but adorable tee for summer,1
2471,Love this sweater ordered white size large great light layer the weave in the yarn is really pretty the variations in texture have an almost burnout look the silver buttons are unusual really stand out and complement the overall look of the sweater it has an uneven hem that drapes beautifully at the back and sides great value on sale one of those basics that everyone needs in their wardrobe,1
2472,Much nicer in person the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than blue as described here there are lovely flecks of rust blue goldenrod green throughout super soft stretchy its fine sizing downotherwise the arm holes dip down very low im usually a size small and xs was best for me bust long torso broad shoulders i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in,1
2473,I love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself it runs a size larger i am usually a and the fits perfectly the skort was one size off for my clients too definitely a great choice for springsummer especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle,1
2474,The price is high and i have to dry clean this no thanks,0
2475,These have a very interesting cut it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall im about and the size fit in the waist but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture its hard to imagine who they would look good on theyre also very poofy right below the waist,0
2476,Its beautiful lovely quality gorgeous bird but the fit just doesnt work for me im usually a medium which is what i got its just too tight in the chest for ref d as is it already flares out some in the bottom so im not gonna bother w a larger size unfortunately,0
2477,Classic dress with a twist with split colors very comfortable without looking like a bag on can be dressed up or down i am and bought th extra small perfect fit for me not form fitting but still has shape and style,1
2478,This is now one of my favorite retailer button downs its super soft and super flattering its everything youd want this cute shirt to be,1
2479,This shirt is true to size it has beautiful detail and feels very soft and comfortable it can be worn to dress up jeans or with a skirt for a night out for dinner,1
2480,I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays love the style and the fit my only disappointment was that they dont have as much stretch as i thought they would i wrote above that it runs small but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok for reference im and i usually wear in pilcro pants but these felt tighter i would exchange for a but theyre sold out unfortunately,1
2481,I love this top fit is perfect for me shows just the right amount of cleavage wore it to dinner on my birthday and got a ton of compliments,1
2482,I needed to get this hemmed about inches but it was well worth it this is a gorgeous effortlessly glam outfit the material is silky soft with some stretch and drapes beautifully i am a and got an xl i think a large would have been better this had extra width at the waist but it worked with the tie belt i loved wearing this and felt comfortable all night,1
2483,This whole order was disappointing the main piece i ordered was cancelled and the two remaining items this sweater included were poorly made there was a snagthread hanging out in the middle of the front of the sweater tried to tuck it in but it wouldnt stay so ill be returning it,0
2484,There were no reviews when i purchased this dress from the picture with the model the dress looks to be a straight shift dress i received mine yesterday and the dress flairs out and isnt straight it is also pretty large i ordered a medium as the smalls were sold out and im not sure i will keep it still on the fence dress is shorter than pictured as well sleeves are shorter than shown now after having seen the dress and looking at the online picture i think the model is holding her a,0
2485,The model looks awesome in this cute top but on me it looked boxy but was too tight around the chest and was too short for reference im lbs and c the front is nonstretchy eyelet lace cotton fabric yet the back is stretchy in theory its pretty but in reality it doesnt work at least for me i think it might work for someone petite with a smaller chest,0
2486,I bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here i think the length is perfect so many of the tees etc are extra long so its nice to have a variety to chose from im and this little tee hits right where my legs begin it is very free flowing and cool i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot,1
2487,I bought the xs and love it it looks better on than in the picture it travels well no wrinkles after being in the suitcase and it is generous on the sides so you can actually eat a full lunch and not feel boxed in afterwards,1
2488,This suit was high quality and a cute design however it is clearly made for a lean body type,0
2489,A great basic t so very much cuter than most i have black and white both and wish it came in more colors,1
2490,I havent worn jeans in a year because i felt uncomfortable and constrained these are as soft as my leggings they have so much stretch you could do yoga in them if you want the jean look wo the stiffnessstructure get these flattering to the booty too,1
2491,I recently purchased this tunic on sale the cut of this top is flattering on my curvy figure as it has a cinched in waist the embroidery is lovely and very bright with several shades of colors i wore this with black leggingsboots and a green cardigan and received many compliments,1
2492,Love love this dress the fit is perfect the cut is feminine and flirty but not too showy and bare there is the perfect amount of swing and its a great length i cant say enough about it i think its worth the price which i have to admit i was hesitant about so comfortable and versatile i see it being worn quite oftenkeep dresses like this comingbtw the neck line is flattering on every body typefor reference im and weigh lbs and i purchased a size but i think a,1
2493,I bought this in blue and cant wait to wear it feels so soft exactly like the picture,1
2494,I loved this dress on the hanger and loved it more when i tried it on i am usually an but purchased the in this dress i preferred the empire waist to be more fitted which the provided you can decide which look you prefer both looked good i just wanted a less baggy look as one reviewer mentioned the print is cut different on all of the dresses i think the colors pictured online are accurate regarding the snake on the fabric i have several snakes on my dress but not on the back a,1
2495,Im normally a size small but the store only had a large i tried it on and it still fits great as an oversized button down for a threwonmyboyfriendsshirt kind of look i wear it tied in a knot with leggingsthe shirt is so so so soft and high in quality,1
2496,This dress is really lovely if fits and flows in a very flattering way although it is a bit long im really tall so thats a very nice feature for me p it actually feels more lineny than i expected to which was surprising i probably didnt read the product description close enough but it was a pleasant surprise cant wait to wear this to brunchbeach parties this summer fair warning its also a little seethrough might want to wear nude underwear,1
2497,This dress is everything i hoped it would be it is soft and comfortable and flattering even though its not tight fitting true to size as well,1
2498,I love this jumpsuit its unique comfortable and fits true to size you can dress it up or down depending on the event every time i wear it i get loads of compliments,1
2499,Love this top wore with jeans comes to about mid hip so good coverage fit was perfect for me,1
2500,I bought this vest hoping to be able to throw it over long sleeve tops for fall and its perfect for that it adds a bit of detail with the buttons and pockets on the vest,1
2501,Love this shirt it runs a bit big i ordered the petite and its a bit long in the sleeves if i dont roll them up and a bit long and big in the back but i love the look and it is classic great with skinny jeans,1
2502,I wore this dress to a party once and havent been able to find an outfit that can top it,1
2503,The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing very disappointing i wish i had found the hole before i try them on they are definitely going back,0
2504,Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature i also like the fabric covered buttons you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone either way it looks cute i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up great quality and features for the price,1
2505,Incredibly flattering cut i got so many compliments when i wore this dress to a friends wedding with the built in bra you dont have to add extra uncomfortable layers it stays put with or without the straps the skirt is blissfully full and fun for twirling i had a little trouble figuring out the belt as it wraps around multiple times but once i worked that out it was perfect love this cut i hope they make it again it different colors,1
2506,Love these pants very figure flattering and fabric stretch holds up well no sag at end of day i am and size hits ankle bone i love these so much i went to order a second pair and size sold out so i ordered an will see how a size bigger works i think may give a looser look but be comfy so happy to have these wear with booties and my tunics peasant blouses and much more highly recommend,1
2507,I love all paige denim i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here i actually like these more because they are more worn looking you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them,1
2508,This is a beautiful flattering top that looks great on its own or layered under kimonos or jackets i bought it in wine and black,1
2509,Im a little on the short side i was afraid it was going to be too long in the back the sweater is perfect all the way around i like the looseness in the front and like the way it lays in the back the color is great,1
2510,I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her i was told they had a different version a few actually and i decided to try it on it actually is pretty flattering i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress i left it open as pictured tied one button and also played with the neck and tried a cowl all very nicei debated getting my usual xs petite but hey they dont make it in petite and the stylist thought the loo,1
2511,Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer you cant get it on i tried my skinny daughter tried no go,0
2512,Nice rendition of a summer halter that resembles denim i bought my normal small but could have downsized to an xs if your busty stay with your normal size as it is more tts i like the blue plaid colors and the soft cotton material its made of it has a very nice flow with the cute peek a boo back neckline the interior fabric lining is also a quite lovely chambray blue that nicely offsets the blue plaid,1
2513,Surprised abt the prev review i had picked mine up at the store a few months back purchased my usual size s its a little oversized soft the front pockets really do appeal to me as always w a cardi i wear the light grey cowled tneck top w it called the carra turtleneck w paige black skinnys i have the other colors in the tneck as well which go well w it also worn a few times when cool but lately its been warm again its abt to be cool again look forward to wearing very comf,1
2514,I bought this dress for my daughter for her birthday and she loved it she tells me she has worn it many times and gets compliments each time on both the style and the color ordered the orange its a lovely lightweight knit and is easy to dress up or down plus it is so comfortable and flattering,1
2515,At first i thought this top was going to be stiff i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is its lovely cream color with beautiful lace details i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go braless when its hot im lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body but i feel this top is slight short on me that might be because i didnt wear it offtheshoulder but had it hang from the top of,1
2516,Love this skirt i enjoy being trendy but i love the retro vibe can be dressed up or worn to work,1
2517,This dress is extremely body conscious so if you want to make an impression wear this dress the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night the pattern is gorgeously done pieced together like a garment three times the cost the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms like myself for me this dress is tts but way too long so i will have to hem,1
2518,Great light weight sweater very simple and soft from the front and the back is adorable,1
2519,Dress is very flattering on not tentlike at all,1
2520,Only thing is the fit is a little loose so i wish the xxs petite wasnt sold out or that there was a xxs at lbs i tried on e xs regular that made the skirt a maxi on me and it was nice but a bit loose i would have worn it as a sexy strapless i tried it just not daring enough to actually wear it like that so i ordered the xs petite we shall seethe navy and beige is a nice classy combo i could see it being pulled off in all seasons depending how you pair it,1
2521,This is really one of those items that hits it out of the park first the fit is great its relaxed without being oversized or tapering way out or way in or something odd like that its nearly universally flattering to most body types and its easy to wear with nearly anything shorts jeans trousers pencil skirtsit looks great dressed up or down i also like that the pleats that create the ruffle are sewn nicely sometimes my recent purchases from retailer have not been the best qua,1
2522,The simplicity of this tshirt will go with jeans shorts or anything casual the macrame and bead details give it that extra style i bought the red and white and love them both the red is warm and bright with pink undertones despite the boxiness of the fit it ran true to size for me i did not think it was too big its meant to be loose and slouchy rather than fitted,1
2523,Cant say enough about this cute dressi bought it in red which is more of a burgundy and paired it with a pair of over the knee burgundy boots i can see wearing this in the spring summer heck all year round quality is nice and the gold zipper down the top of the back is a classy touch dont pass this one up,1
2524,The top is quite lovely and good quality i ended up getting a size which fit similarly to the model photos i am smaller up top and wide in the hips but the shape worked well for my shape,1
2525,Really loved this dress online and was excited to try it out when it arrived it was heavy bulky in the package which didnt bode well taking it out of the bag i was surprised at how heavy thick it was the picture really looks like it would be a flowy grecian dress to throw on during a hot summer day but in the reality you might drown in sweat the interior linings promised absolutely no breathing fabricwanted to love this as the style is very cute but was disappointed by the mate,0
2526,True to size length is perfect for soft fabric not too low cut in the front but not all covered up either ruching is subtle and does not add bulk skirt portion skims curves neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them strap design is perfect covers bra while revealing a touch of skin comfortable and effortless to wear very very pretty,1
2527,I wanted to love this coat so bad the material is lovely and its beautiful on the hanger but being tall and skinny is a must to pull it off if you have any hips forget it my hips are you end up looking incredibly bottom heavy the jacket also ran funny across the shoulderslike the underarm was sewn low down the arm so arm movement was restricted it was weird but it buttoned nicely without any pulling so it wasnt a size thing i bought a size medium at and pounds,0
2528,This top is absolutely gorgeous it fits true to size to slightly large id say size down if you are between sizes it has a nice weight to it not too heavy but for a winter season top it is not too thin colors are as pictured i can pair this with black pants or with skinny jeans it is a top that i will wear for years to come,1
2529,This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap,0
2530,I ordered this lovely blouse the moment i saw it and i am very pleased that it is the quality and fit id hoped for i bought the medium in pink i am f size or medium on most tops the medium fits me perfectly i love the gathering at top back so that there is no pulling at all across the back or bust i am mystified that all blouses arent designed with a nice level of gathering to accommodate a bust and to give a flattering flow i am busty so awkward tightness can be a problem o,1
2531,Perfect except a little snug around the hips very forgiving silhouette,1
2532,I was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s rompers can be tricky i am lbs i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect it is just long enough in the body for me the shorts length is perfect not too short or too long i cant wait to wear this,1
2533,I tried on this top in store was a bit wishy washy on it at first however i am so glad i bought it and have worn it x in a week shh it is incredibly lightweight breathable which is great for hot texas summers i also love that it has interesting back detail the other reviewers mentioned it was see through but i dont agree i wear a nude bra with it and have no issues it can be worn casually with shorts or dressed up with white denim fancier accessories either way it looks best w,1
2534,This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse which i also ordered its extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse it added pounds the print is beautiful the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail i ordered size large and am well endowed steer clear if you have a bust,0
2535,This is a lovely wellfitting embroidered navy tank i cannot find a flaw in this i am lbs d and the size is a fantastic fit one of those tops that is so wellcut that it feels as if one is wearing nothing the lining is impeccably done and is cut perfectly for the blouse it has a small cutout in the back at the v it fits just as the photo shows and is so versatileit can be worn with everything from jeans to a formal skirt six stars,1
2536,I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made then it would have been a winner,0
2537,The fit is incredible the print is very subtle but makes them a little bit edgy and easy to pair with many things i already have in my closet,1
2538,Love the fabric fits true to size great quality,1
2539,This bra is so well made and fits beautifully,1
2540,This top is has an awkward neckline doesnt lay like the photo as mentioned by another reviewer see threw and of poor quality the fit is very baggy and unflattering and material is very thin it also runs very large the color is pretty but that is it,0
2541,At last in a world of loose billowy silhouettes a draped top that falls a little closer to the body the fabric is of good weight and has the right amount of stretchi also love the retrovintage pattern of the fabric itself the fit is feminine and comfortableyou will have to wear a camisole with this top but i do not consider that a negative it is the way of the deep v neck,1
2542,Thick soft awesome quality whats not to love ive had an awful time finding a new black warm cardigan this year to throw over anything from a tee to a casual dress and this finally fits the bill while it is soft like a sweatshirt i would definitely not say that this is purely loungewear nice enough to replace my old ratty sweaterknit,1
2543,Ordered this on a whim while taking advantage of a promotion and now need one in every color the weight and cut is perfect for fallwintersummer not too heavy but not sheertissue thin fitted enough to look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans fabric has a nice quality feel to it i have similar shirts from the past that have held up well in the wash im anticipating the same with this,1
2544,Gorgeous blush color soft flowing material made for a perfect outdoor summer wedding guest dress the elastic around the waist could have been slightly tighter as the dress is a bit weighted but not loose enough to deter my purchase im curvy and this dress was very flattering im on the shorter side and didnt buy the petite it wasnt available in store and i bought this the day before the wedding i had to pick up the dress to walk up steps but was fine otherwise in inch heels i receiv,1
2545,Beautiful dress the dress appears more blue in the picture it is actually green made well i love it,1
2546,I got this dress in the navy blue and it fits perfect there is a little too much fabric in the middle but it allows the dress the stretch more the fabric on the button is a little thin and not lined but you really cant see anything through it im and usually purchase the petite but the regular fit just fine and hit me about mid knee the petite would have probably been too short,1
2547,I got this tank because it was on sale thinking it could be cute but i didnt have high hopes once i put it on i loved it i have a long torso and its the perfect length i have worn it with a jacket over it also to extend its life into cooler weather,1
2548,A mango beauty that resonates the color of blossoms in bloom comfortable effortless and charming i wear a size small in retailer dresses and this one fit true to size for me tried the xs since reviews mentioned it ran large but too tight across my average chest looks great with denim jacket and red suede strappy sandals also worn with a belt to accentuate waist,1
2549,This romper is so flattering i normally dont like how short rompers are but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me not to mention that its super comfortable i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements very happy i bought it i normally wear a medium but the small fit me perfectlyid recommend sizing down,1
2550,Love this little number very flattering warm and soft color goes with everything i tried it on with a slip dress and it added class and warmth big button details are fun wellmade and beautiful cut i ordered xxs petite and it fit like a glove with room for something underneath if needed i also ordered te xs petite as my stylist was afraid xxs would be small but will keep xxs p after actually trying it on lbs dd in waist,1
2551,I live in hawaii and always looking for a comfortable light and breezy dresses this was perfect the colors are gorgeous the fit is true to size and it is extremely comfortable dress it up or dress it down with a denim jacket and you will be definitely love it i am thrilled i made the purchase,1
2552,Super comfy and longer than last years version minus the hood love it,1
2553,Im fairly petite and was not expecting this to be as long as it was on me its actually great for leggings or skinny jeans though good quality material too,1
2554,I love everything about this dress it is comfortable classic good quality and fits really well there are two layers to the material so nothing is see throughthe styling on the back is to die for there is a subtle gold line that runs through the blue and white stripes the first day i wore this i received compliments while shopping in a single storeit is a bit loose in the middle but i paired it with a skinny belt and it was the perfect fix i can usually wear petite or regular i p,1
2555,I bought this dress tonight and i love it the fit is perfect and the color is perfect the dress runs true to size as all dolan products do i ill wear this dress to an interview with tall heel boots love this dress and think everyone should give it a try,1
2556,I bought this on sale and absolutely love it i bought the xs im lbs and a bc cup and it fit well i am considering sewing in cups since i dont like using stickon bras as much and none of my other bras work with the back that really is my only complaint about the dress everything else is great,1
2557,Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired very wide under arms too much material looks more like a maternity dress i ordered a small petite would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available oh well returning this,0
2558,I got the yellow ones and love them so much i ordered the stone color very comfortable and i can wear in th office or on the weekend thinking about ordering every color i love the pilcro hyphen line fits my frame and athletic build perfectly im lbs and wear a size,1
2559,I didnt notice this online but it caught my eye in the store the colors are bright and beautiful i wear a or ml i tried the but the bust was too big i wear a c i ordered the size and it fits perfect im so glad i saw it in the store i think it makes much more of an impact in person than online,1
2560,This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since its not see through i really like it the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong sizeordered a small i checked my order and i got a xs petite so sad since large is the only size left,1
2561,I saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself i have to have that top it is perfect for the fall season the patternprint is very intricate and lovely i think it fits true to size the petite xxs is just right the sleeves do not come to the wrist but the photo here depicts that already the elastic in the arms feel a little tight but that would be my own negative comment the fabric is beautiful and flows just right it does not feel to big to me at all im s,1
2562,Love everything about this the length cut look etc i wear mediumlarge went with medium and it was perfect,1
2563,When i saw these lounge pants i felt as though they were designed specifically for me i love the cute bird design i love the greenblue color of the fabric the material is soft and inviting give them a try you wont regret it,1
2564,These ultraslimming jeans are so comfy the rise is a little higher than i am used to but it covers those little muffin tops perfectly the color is very dark almost black which adds to the slimming effect i have really long legs and these have a little extra at the bottom which is great you could wear with flats booties boots just about any type of shoes these are my new favorite jeans,1
2565,Love everything about this dress i ordered the red which is more of a red orange with cream and beige as pictured colors are beautiful the dress has a nice drape great feel love it,1
2566,I love this peasant top i didnt expect it to be made from such nice fabric usually i have to wear a camisole under a lot of retailer tops but not this one i bought a petite xs and if fits perfectly thank you to retailer for selling petite clothes,1
2567,The bottom part of this romper is easy to put on but the top is very poorly designed it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear once i got it on it fit perfectly though getting out of it was a disaster i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip overall i was crushed that it didnt work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering,0
2568,Great fit and extremely comfortable,1
2569,Good quality tank very flowy and longer if you are short,1
2570,I love this sweater aside from it being absolutely adorable the quality is great and the sizing is accurate i have received so many compliments on it so far and honestly i want to wear it everyday the sweater is super soft and comfy and of course i totally recommend it thanks retailer,1
2571,Believe the reviews this dress is very flattering great quality and an excellent print i got the polka dot i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty dd but this looks great is appropriate for work love,1
2572,I love this skirt so soft and comfortable i wore it casual with black nike sneakers a black loose turtleneck top and a moto leather jacket i tried on the m and l and went with the m so i would say it is true to size because that is what i usually wear im lbsnice thick fabric but not heavy good for cool weather,1
2573,I ordered this shirt in the greyblue color choice the creamy grey is perfectly heathered and the blue silklike bottom is a classy touch the fit of this shirt in the arms torso and back was flattering with a little room to drape love it,1
2574,Its a bit baggy im normally a medium but went with the small here i debated for a while but finally went for it on sale and im so glad the colors are just gorgeous in person delicate stitching on the shoulders adds a feminine touch great with my jean jacket which gathers up the extra material just right looks great with summer sandals and booties for fall i love love love this dress,1
2575,This dress is versatile and cute i purchased the xxs at lbs and it fit perfect a steal at the sale price,1
2576,Soft knit perfectly finished comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers mom it just looks too emptynester for my style and i wont be until this is a nice base for a creative dresseraccessorizer which im not im also messy so its hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free im glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted knotted is for quality garments just had to pass on this for personal style reasons,1
2577,I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlotburgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured the tunic is medium weigh and has aline shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable the sleeve are straight cut not tight and quarter in length i will wear it with leggings and bootsbooties this coming fall i find this tunic is wellmade and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made wrong color fyi lbs c,1
2578,Really love the pattern and color combination the dress has an attached lining to around the knee i would say this is tts or a little big im and around and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long lean look i love the feeling of effortlessnesswith cute sandals this is an outfit,1
2579,This was such an impulse buy i bought it online during a sweater sale and i am so glad i did this is definitely one of my favorite recent purchases it definitely seems more like a coat than a sweater but it is lightweight i ordered the red and it is beautiful it looks great buttoned or left open and i think this could be dressed up or down though it does have a hood so that gives it a slightly more casual feel it fits true to size and it is definitely shorter in the front than the ba,1
2580,I wish i could wear this sweater every day it is extremely soft runs large lbs bought a large and it was way too big but i successfully shrunk it in the dryer sleeves are too bulky its not perfection especially the sleeves the photo shows the models with the sleeves pushed up there is no way you could do that they are almost like bell sleeves and the material stretches like crazy wish i had ordered down but still love it,1
2581,I ordered this dress online the colors are pretty if you like pastels and the fit is true to size however it fits very much like a maternity dress for those of you rocking a baby bump this is a good choice for others who are not its just not flattering my figure got lost in the dress and the high waist did not look good on me i returned it,0
2582,This is just adorable on i go between a small and medium and the small was perfect for me i wore this with tights and boots but can also see this working in warmer weather with sandals or peeptoe booties,1
2583,Im calling this the gateway jumpsuit for all those ladies who are wondering about this whole jumpsuit trend and how they feel about ityou know who you are this jumper is flattering comfortable elevatedand worth trying on im petite but longwaisted with curves on the bottom which can be a tough combo when trying to find a jumper i actually ordered the petite first which was better fitting in the waist area but i ended up ultimately purchasing the regular since i preferred where,1
2584,Just got this shirt in the mail and i am absolutely in love i paired it with jeans and brown boots and got so many compliments the shirt is light and flowy it very flattering for any body shape,1
2585,Very pretty top with beautiful lace detail both front and back love the way the material feels and it hangs very niceactually slimming i purchased the black would highly recommend,1
2586,A perfect basic teeloved how soft it is not worth full price but definitely one to add to your cart once on sale,1
2587,My husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on i dont normally go for patterns like this but i thought it was cute and springyi tried on a large first since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders im tall big boned and pounds the large actually stuck out funny at the bottom and didnt do much for my shapethe medium however was great it was long enough to hide my belly and cover enough of my waistband that i wouldnt,1
2588,I love this blouse it is such a classic silhouette the fit is not so loose on me as the model but i have a much more curvy figure at a size large i am completely coverd up in this top and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual i can see myself wearing this top again and again great purchase,1
2589,This is my second pair of joggers from retailer and since this purchase i have bought another pair it seems that they are just a great fit for my body long and lean but not extreme someone said they run large but my experience is true to size these pants can be very casual around the house out for errands or dressed up and worn for casual evenings out i love that the elastic waist isnt bunchee they hang very straight and pretty just like in this picture the fabric has some text,1
2590,This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants its a great shirt,1
2591,I ordered my normal size they were a little tight however im glad because they normally stretch out quite a bit so im assuming they should fit perfect after one wearing the length is fine for my height and they are very soft im so happy with the light red color its almost a rust which i love,1
2592,Love the jeans the color is listed as black for some reason but they are definitely blue like the picture and what i love most is ive always wanted somewhat distressed jeans but for me the ripped jeans look doesnt work these are perfectly distressed without being holey i also love the length im usually a person because i love ankle length for boots tall and short these are listed i think a bit shorter than that i think but didnt feel cropped they are also made of some special,1
2593,Love this top for work loose flattering and enough detail to be noticed fits tts and goes with everything,1
2594,This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier the fabric is pretty lightweight but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season,1
2595,Perfect awesome i have a few of these now and love them they do stretch a little so i wouldnt size up im about pounds and and normally m i wear the in these,1
2596,Its short and wide not a good combo for anyone who isnt stick thin,0
2597,Its a fine dress but it definitely runs small and its actually a lot shorter than i was expecting especially since im only,0
2598,My skirt arrived this week and its beautiful im so happy i splurged on it im usually a size and the medium fits perfect although it is quite long im though i will probably get it hemmed but went ahead and wore it anyway and actually found i like it a bit long and its very comfortable the fabric is very high quality and the color is stunning,1
2599,Usually wear s and xs tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way two layers green on outside and a polyester beige layer underneathbut definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket,0
2600,The fabric is thin though you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up,1
2601,Warm and cozy tights for my daughter she loves them,1
2602,These citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are hugevery versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute its a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans,1
2603,This dress was my absolute favorite recent retailer purchase the fit is so flattering i think this dress runs true to sizei usually wear a size in hd in paris and thats what size i ordered i expect i could have fit in a but the is comfortable i am but i ordered the regular length and it hit just above the knee i agree that it could use pockets but no need for lining however i just laundered this dress for the first timehand wash lay flat to dry as recommended and this dr,0
2604,Pretty pyjama pants that can be worn running errands dropping off kids,1
2605,Love this romper very impressed that even though the material is ivory colour its not sheer and undergarments wont show through a forgiving fit for everyone,1
2606,I am normally about lb but im about lb now at months prego i purchased the small i cant resist buying retailer clothes even though they might not fit me currently however because this shirt is drapey it actually fits over my baby bump now and it will be perfect as a nursing shirt and then regular shirt later it is so soft and great quality will be cute dressed up for work or down with jeans,1
2607,Absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding it is so well made and luxurious i feel amazing in it even more gorgeous in person,1
2608,Pretty fabric nice style took it back,0
2609,Im a huge skort fan from way back but finding a cute skort is harder than finding a needle in a haystack so when i saw this on line i was excited and when i saw it in the store my hopes were confirmed this is truly a stylish functional skort the diagnol hem is flattering along with the two buckle details love the pockets you even get a little bonus pocket the fabric is a beautiful color moss and soft so it hangs in a flattering manner instead of bunching up this skort looks grea,1
2610,I originally ordered the regular xxs loose fit xxs nowadays and the length was right above the knee it looked great and classyclassic but i felt like perhaps the chest height would be better in petite so i ordered the xxs p as well decision timei decided on petite because the overall dress fit my body better though it is now shorter a couple inches above the knee still looks classy with a boot but flirtier embroidery is beautiful as others mentioned fabric is comfortable,1
2611,if you look at the th photo of the grey shirt and zoom in you can get an accurate view of the back this shirt is attached in not one but two places in the back in the photos of the black shirt it looks like it is only attached or knotted in one place and that is not the case disappointing unless you want to wear this as an offtheshoulder shirt with a strapless bra size down caveat sizing down will become problematic though for those with large arms as the sle,0
2612,I never buy anything at retailer full price but had to get this when i tried it at my local store especially since its back ordered for so long its very flattering and super comfortable fully lined not see through at all elastic waist thats hidden under the sweater top will be so easy to throw on and dress up for an evening out or lounge in after a day at the pool or beach looking at the model pics i was concerned the arm pit holes came too low but on me that is not the case the t,1
2613,I love how these jeans look on tts adorable i exchanged my first pair due to stitching coming out in the back right pocket pair the stitching came out in the exact same place this seems to be a problem with the qualitysewing the fact that the stitching is gold and decorative as well as functional means it will keep unraveling until the jeans are ruined nd pair has to go back too bad,0
2614,Adorable comfortable im lbs and ordered an xs,1
2615,I love these sleep pants they are the perfect length iam and slim these fit great its so hard to find pants that fit tall slender women,1
2616,I spotted these on the sale rack and loved the design the almost regal fabric toned down to casual by the cropped denim cuffs they werent my size but to my surprise they could be ordered in my size still at the sale pricethe fit was perfect they will surely make a statement wherever i choose to wear them,1
2617,This skirt looks just like it does on the model it is the prefect maxi skirt with lots of movement i actually bought the off the shoulder top it is paired with you cant tell on the model but the slit has buttons up it so you can undo or do as many of the buttons as you want to show off as much leg as you want it is a little priceybut well worth it,1
2618,I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person it just looks awful gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall it is just a wrinkly mess another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree it looks very shabby it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon,0
2619,I cant wait to wear thisbut it has been to hot in the southyou can wear this so many waysthe material is wonderful and the pattern better in person,1
2620,This is an absolutely fabulous skirt i cant wait to wear it the biggest challenge is finding the best way to accessorize it i am an artist and have lots of clothing but havent created that ab fab combo yet i will,1
2621,I got the moss color in this cardigan im not sure why these arent sold out because it is pretty amazing it is super soft and is a cute addition to a casual outfit i would say that for this price its definitely worth the buy,1
2622,Just received my dress today and i am pleased with the quality of the dress i am small on top small waist with hips and a heavy bottom i normally wear a size dress so i ordered this dress in a size and it was a perfect fit the material is soft and so comfortable the zipper was not a issue as mentioned in the other comments i cant wait to wear this my new favorite dress,1
2623,Great looking jacket with attitude the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey im usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest luckily its a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open,1
2624,More of an aline rather than tunic shapewhich makes this a great flattering springthroughsummer party and barbecue throw on true to size washable the indigo and purpleygray pop with the mix of rose stripes and the fringe and length keep it from being dowdy im and this hit mid thigh i keep pulling it out of the closet and trying it on cant wait for the weather to turn in earnest to wear this sassiness out,1
2625,I love this dress i will be living in it this fall and winter the color is perfect the fabric is soft seriously it is so conformable and cute i will style it with booties tall boots with vests wear it as a tunic i love it as a dress i didnt think it was too short at all im so things tend to be short on my anyway but i thought this was perfect and hit in the right spots love love love it,1
2626,I purchased this in navy and love it my only complaint is that is is a little big in the shoulders i am about lbs and the small is still a bit too big aside from that it is a great design and length and ive worn it both with jeans and leggings boots,1
2627,A fun casual romper i loved the pink color not usually my thing which looks great with darker skin like another reviewer said the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes i took a size in this but am usually a this will make the top part a bit blousy but i think that adds to the appeal look,1
2628,Really love this top even more than i expected based on the picture i have already worn it times in a short period of time its been a great fall top,1
2629,Very flatttering skirt super cute highly recommend,1
2630,Im about lbs and tall and usually a small would be my size these fit but i would be more comfy in a m they are stretchy soft and opaque perfect for under a couple sweater dresses i picked up by retailer will be reordering,1
2631,This dress is a marvel its flattering and cute it is great for work a date or just a casual day and machine washable best thing ive ever purchased from retailer,1
2632,Im a and curvy these pants fit well and are so comfortable i think everyone should own at least one pair,1
2633,I am very petite and ordered the xs it is too big which is often the case i gauge how much i like something by my willingness to spend even more money on alterations i love this jacket so much that i am willing to go through that extra step i love winter and this is a perfect winter top the faux fur is very soft and cozy and has a rich look to it i have yet to have it altered which is the only reason for my stars under quality i dont yet know how it will fit once complete the fact tha,1
2634,I fell in love with these bottoms at first site i was a little worried they would not work for me because im a curvy size but to my surprise they look great i tried on the large as that is what i usually wear at retailer but i was able to size down to a medium which was great cause it minmized some of the fullness for me they are light and breezy and will be the perfect alternative from shorts which i hate they are so worth trying,1
2635,Fits beautifully perfect for spring and summer the cut of this skirt gives your figure a wonderful shape the quality of the material is excellent this item is perfect for to dress up for a date night or wear slightly more casually for a brunch,1
2636,So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color this year i got the darker grey color is great goes with so muchand they are so soft and comfortable also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom,1
2637,Tried on a size regular and it fit well felt incredibly soft and airy and is handwashable im currently or with narrow shoulders and torso somewhat longwaisted but petite from bust to shoulders i often wear a size p or in retailer dresses and tops the arm holes were a tiny bit low but not terrible a petite would have been shorter but also more of an empire waist the pink really is more of a red like the online photo great color,1
2638,This is such a cute top perfect for fall layered with a sweater,1
2639,I love this dress i was afraid it would be too long because it said petite was but it was perfect i am and ordered the size xsp and the length is perfect however in the picture the lining is shorter than the outer layer but on my dress the lining in longer than the dress in some areas the dress is very modest in the front and the back has a nice plunge but not too low,1
2640,Only the xxs was left so i was a little concerned that it might be too small not the case at all thanks to the very functional adjustable straps high quality of craftsmanship design for reference im c lbs kind off petite wan athletic build the black is lovely classic the color along with the beautiful design give this a timeless classic french look very comfortable too love so much i ordering more,1
2641,Like the last reviewer i saw these pants in the store and decided to give them a try im glad i did because i absolutely love them and they were the last pair on the rack the fabric is nice and light perfect for warm summer evenings and the pattern is really pretty almost like a watercolor painting this is my third pair of sleep pants by elouise and i absolutely love them all,1
2642,I love this top the top has nice details and is not too sheer it did have a smell at first but thats gone now,1
2643,Hadnt really looked at this dress till i saw it in person in the store so i tried it on im only and lb busty on top so i tried the it was a smidge snug decided since the dress has no give to go with a would have liked this in a petite for the shorter length but its back ordered till august and i really wanted to take it with me on vacation its just above my ankles in regular length which will work and i can up the score with some wedges this dress fits like a dream and,1
2644,I love this little number the quality is terrific the weight is perfect and the cut is superb i love the way it fits and looks in the arms i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect i like that it is cool and flowy without looking like maternity attire i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another i was about to order what looks like a yellow one but i noticed the color is labeled chartreuse can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in real life,1
2645,Gorgeous colors great neckline can be worn off one shoulder the slits on the side allow for wear as tunic or as half tucked very cute,1
2646,Knitted and knotted makes such gorgeous sweaters this is bathed in lovely almost impresssionistic color and the deep ruffle at the bottom is feminine and flattering i adored the way theres enough wraparound to get cozy in it as i wore it through my day i went with the green in a regular medium which is my normal size size f the mohair enhances the soft feeling and lush look as i wore this piece today i felt that i was wearing something very special,1
2647,I love this vest i think it is heavy for a warm springsummer day so kindve surprised it was featured at the store early spring i waited for it to go on sale and purchased my normal retailer size medium i agree it may seem big or loose fitting but i am a vest girl and the fit for me is perfect size dd lbs and ft in height it is a great finishing piece for causal or office attire this vest will definitely stay in my closet for a long time beautiful quality,1
2648,Super cute jacket perfect for fall i cant stop wearing it,1
2649,I recommend this dress because it is beautiful stylish and well made even though it did not work for me i tried the small and extra small the first way too big lengthwise hit my knees as well as in the shoulders the latter to tight across the chest not for me but worth a try i am typically a small with usually never have a problem with length,0
2650,I have to admit seeing these tops online i wouldnt give them a second glance but at my local store they were displayed in a gorgeous summery fashion and were so light and airy and flowy my summer checklist i bought both the blue and rust color in an xl i am a xlh and this is one of the few button up shirts that actually fit i think i might go in and add a snap between the bust line anyway since the buttons are spaced too generously but there is no pulling this top does run long,1
2651,This sweater is much more beautiful in person the quality is very good and the fur is nice too i am inches and lbs and the medium fit me perfect,1
2652,Maybe the softest sweater that i own buy it and you wont regret it,1
2653,The shorts have a linen look but have just a touch of stretch to them which is great for keeping their shape im lbs and the shorts hit about down my thigh which is just long enough to cover but still sexy the s fit but snug all over the s gave a looser look but still fit in the waist i have the navy and the mango definitely recommend,1
2654,I am lbs and the m fits perfectly it is flowy and feminine but the tie in the back keeps it from looking boxy pattern is really nice great dress,1
2655,I agree with the previous reviewer the color variation is much more subtle than what is shown online i would not have bought it had i not seen it in real life this is a super cute soft and comfortable shirt it fits tts and can be worn with jeans leggings or a skirt for reference im and lbs and i took a small but probably could have gone with xs as well but i like the extra room,1
2656,Love this cardigan ordered the red which is a nice tomato red but not orange sz medium fits perfect on my frame dd lbs and love the style and finishes a pant skirt or dress nicely i just may order the black did not see this item in the store near me but lucky to order it on sale beautiful quality,1
2657,The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on sent it back wouldnt buy even on sale,0
2658,This is a cross between a sweater and a sweatshirt not a heavy weight but very warm the color is vibrant many compliments,1
2659,This is a unique color and a lovely dress i have the yellow and i didnt find that it ran large it definitely has a loose flowing fit and you can wear with or without a belt for different looks the pleated fabric near the waist does fit differently than the other fabrics but i dont think it looks odd you have several pictures of people wearing them and you can see that it looks amazing on everyone,1
2660,Fun to wear inside sneakers or just around the house shoeless my daughters tried to take them but i held on to them,1
2661,Love this tshirt casual but can be dressed up with wedges and a scarf,1
2662,Love this sweater it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease very soft and seems durable i highly recommend it,1
2663,Perfect fall top extra long sleeves perfect for keeping the chill off,1
2664,Not tissue thin like most tees and easily can be dressed up to wear to work in a casual setting i find myself reaching for this tee weekly have every color i usually avoid stripes however this tee seems to flatter and slim love,1
2665,I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style so fun and love the texture i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting,1
2666,Love this sweatshirt im lbs and ordered the xsmall its a little boxy but very comfy its definitely light peach in color and not pink as shown very happy with this purchase,1
2667,I have purchased many of retailers henley tees throughout the years this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store i love the look of the crisp white but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hotanyhow this shirt is made in my favorite springsummer tee shirt fabric s linen linen gets so soft and drapey over time the yoke is lace the arms have a small ruching that is sewn not buttoned up l,1
2668,Beautiful shirt for a great price i love a good striped shirt and i got it on sale,1
2669,I was disappointed in this shirt the color was not the pretty blue pictured but rather a grayish blue which may look good on a brunette but not on a blonde the fabric felt like linen and wrinkled easily normally the quality of the fabric is one of my main reasons to buy holding horses but this one felt cheap the detail and craftsmanship was beautiful and i wish this shirt would have worked for me i waited for it to go on sale and was very excited to receive it holding horses is one of,0
2670,I tried on about items in the store today and didnt buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral tshirt i may have to go back for it the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt the fit is exceptional as well not too loose or too snug i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price,1
2671,I loved the way this sweater was made my arms are really short so the sleeves were way too long and looked silly rolled,1
2672,Although i was worried it wouldnt live up to its sticker price im glad i bought this shirt it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes the lace details make it seem dressy and special the fabric feels luxurious sleeves are almost too short for my long arms but they are good enough,1
2673,I didnt buy it for the longest time based on the other reviews but i finally did and i love it great color great quality great fit oh and great price too i say go for it,1
2674,Oh how i love this bra its so comfortable and very flattering i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not and the floral lace here is just beautiful the daisytype flowers look so cute and feminine ive got it in so many colors now for sizing im b and the sm fits great,1
2675,I was hoping that this would be a nice neutral layering staple but it simply leaves a lot to be desired it fits tts length is finethe inside is some but the outside darker material is stiff and cheap kinda canvas feeling the material is super stiff which makes it flare out like like a tent in a super unflattering way it also is on the thinnish side it looks in the model shot like it would be a little thicker and warm this is definitely going back,0
2676,This dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater,1
2677,Very nicely made sweater which fits well i bought the black with white accent and am very pleased with my purchase the small fit me perfectly d cant wait to wear it this fall,1
2678,This top is really beautiful but looks absolutely horrible on my apple shaped body in the words of my husband i looked like a star trek villain,0
2679,I normally wear a size because of my shoulders and back after reading reviews after purchasing dress online i was expecting it to be too small it is in fact somewhat large i love the way i feel in it i am and the length is perfect i cannot wait to wear it the black is so soft love the boho feel yet classic and feminine,1
2680,The quality of this vest is outstanding and the warmth is exceptional i have worn it as a jacket on milder days in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted it runs large by style but i am lbs and i can carry it off,1
2681,I love the lacy details on the skirt this dress is perfectly simple yet can be dressed up too as the evenings get cooler it pairs up nicely with a cropped denim jacket or a cardigan,1
2682,As a beach coverup this would be great but im surprised retailer calls this a dress and doesnt show on the model how thin it is its pretty sheer and i couldnt get away without layering it,0
2683,This sweater is very lightweight with the loose knit but is much warmer than i was expecting the periwinkle color is gorgeous the chiffon hem provides a cute detail and it is true to size for a loose fit,1
2684,I tried this on in the store and i found my regular medium to be a bit too boxy i ended up going with the petite large because i found it just fit better it wasnt too wide and fit just rightit is very soft not itchy at all it says dry clean only but it did great on my hand wash setting with cold water laid it out to dry great purchase,1
2685,I love sundry and their fun designsi was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey it is just not what i expected from the picture i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body,0
2686,Dont be fooled by the image unless you have a cd chest this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middleexactly where you want it least very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality back it goes,0
2687,This is the most beautiful and flattering skirt it was a bit of an investment piece for me in that i just graduated from college but i love that this skirt can be worn year round it is more fitted at the top and then flows out at the bottom making it super flattering pictures do not do it justice,1
2688,Very poorly made wide and short very unflattering the material is advertised as cotton but it felt very synthetic,0
2689,Note the inseam runs a little longer than stated above if you are truly a inseam you may want to get the petite size i purchased the petite small my inseam is and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet however the length can be changed depending on where you wearplace them on your hipive worn these trousers at home and around town with ease they are a wonderful cold weather goto wardrobe staple i wear a nylon trouser slip with them to prolong the need for cleaning,1
2690,Soft and unique love the sleeves my usual size medium fits perfectly per the other reviewer i guess my bust is large enough for the flowers to be on the side and not directly on breasts my only wish is that it has some embroidery on itlove,1
2691,This fit perfectly i am pounds and ordered a small i was very pleased with the way it draped over my body i bought the black one,1
2692,Hesitant at first to spend so much on a swimsuit definitely worth the money quality all aroundstylefit appreciated the review i read prior to purchase to size up so happy i was able to get it on sale as well roughly but can see why it cost so much,1
2693,This is a beautiful piece the fabric is a nice weight and the cut of the lace across the shoulders is flattering the sleeves are dramatic but not overly fussy sadly i returned the dress because although it is a swing style no waistline it has a very straight cut i was hoping it was more of an aline silhouette to accommodate my hips but alas if you selfidentify as a pear this may not be the dress for you,1
2694,This blazer is beautiful it runs tts it is lightly lined with an offwhite poplin in the body of the jacket the offwhite lining is an adorable swiss dot though the lining makes the lace portions of the jacket not completely see through a darker shirt would still show through the detail is amazing from the adorable buttons to the variations in the fabric texture i am and the fit as far as length is very similar to what is shown on the model the sleeves are a little on the long,1
2695,I cant get enough of maxi dresses and i cant resist tracy reese this stunning dress caught my eye immediately but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter im so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out this dress fits perfectly its flattering to my figure the print is beautiful the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and im just so happy for sizing reference here are my stats dd and i purchased the medium,1
2696,On sale this is a great deal the structure and fit of it are perfect maybe runs a tad big but i liked that its supposed to be a snug fit and is without being too clingy i chose the berry color and love it the ribbed style of fabric wasnt as visible in the pic online but i dont mind it in the darker color can be worn with a bit of flair by unbuttoning the turtleneck or kept classic by not,1
2697,Love the color and the design it is slightly seethrough which i dont like but it still works wotb a nude bra very comfortable,1
2698,I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a springsummer item but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders,1
2699,I love this top it is cute with shorts capris and jeans its really comfortable but looks put together and stylish great for running errands to drinks with the girls a good transition piece into fall with a light cardigan,1
2700,What a great fit it is casual but can be dressed up i could have done the extra small but the small isnt too big and is still flattering,1
2701,Love this sweater it is easy to wear and goes well with multiple outfits it is a great flexible add to my wardrobe it fits well even in the sleeves,1
2702,Love these jeans runs true to size and has a bit of stretch can uncuff them and have a longer straight jean very versatile,1
2703,The fabric and design of this piece are so unique i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears which is the case for this jumpsuit despite the extra volume the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless though it doesnt seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid,1
2704,I am usually a medium but sized down to a small for a more fitted look the light pink is slightly sheer but will look great over leggings and jeans i love the detail on the sleeve,1
2705,I was eyeing this sweatshirt but didnt want to pay full price i got it on sale and am so happy i did it is super soft and comfy it also fits perfectly not too baggy but also not form fitting as a moz fan i couldnt pass it up awesome sweatshirt,1
2706,These pants are fun i use them as sleep pants i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort,1
2707,What a perfect dress it was perfect for a black tie optional wedding i didnt want another black dress but when i saw this i knew it was something special i am lbs and dd the size fit my top better but the size length was better but i decided to stay with the size,1
2708,Love the design of the fabric i actually bought these in both colors i gave only star due stitching on the fabric its very scratchy,0
2709,The top is totally see through and fabric some what itchy it also feels cheap to the touch i love the idea but cant keep it for this priceim a shorty so id have to hem it too sadly will return,0
2710,This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear love it,1
2711,Love this dress really comfortable and flattering the arm holes are a little big but not too much for me to return the dress or not wear it love it,1
2712,Love the fabric print and cut its a smidge low in the neckline but thats probably because im busty nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers,1
2713,Beautiful design and fit,1
2714,Although seemingly simple this hooded sweater top is actually versatile wear with jeans or leggings even a skirt wear over a cami tank or even sleeved top i do like the delicate nature of this piece and it does appear to be made well enough to be durable would recommend,1
2715,Really cute and comfortable i can wear it to work for a casual friday or out on the weekend a lot of the sequins are falling off and getting stuck in my dryer,1
2716,This is the most intricate delicate beautiful dress i have seen in a long time the pale blue coppery brown and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin dark hair and light eyes unfortunately my normal size was far too snug especially on my hips and this is now sold out the fabric has no give so i would say with any curves size up if you can find this beauty im heartbroken to be returning it,1
2717,I love this tank top i was looking for a mockneck tank for a while and this totally fit the bill i wear it to work and out and feel great in it,1
2718,Beautiful skirt dress up or down colors are lovely and enable one to wear many different tops lightweight perfect for casual or summertime work,1
2719,This runs tts maybe a little on the large side i typically wear between a small and a medium or and and the small was a perfect fit this is my second jumpsuit and i always worry about how easy they are to pull down for restroom breaks i drink a ton of water this one is relatively easy it has a button at the back neck that you have to unfasten and its super easy and not awkward at all i love how you can dress this up with heels for a night out or pair with sandals for a more cau,1
2720,I had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase love it for fit and graphics those happy little skiers i think many reviewers here dont realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style its not meant to be tailored for tucking in if you want to tuck it youll be wearing a highwaisted skirt or pant cute also rayon fabric is a good choice for the style being heavier than cotton and having a better drape over the chest the sloping longer hemline toward the,1
2721,This jumpsuit is great i finally found a jumpsuit that works with my longer torso the fabric is so comfortable and moves with you im planning to pair a thick belt with the jumpsuit over the portion with the tie just for some added detail while wearing the piece its quite easy to get in and out of,1
2722,This is an adorable basic i should have been wearing it once a week this summer but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear this brand makes some of the softest cutest tees but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash i wash on gentle hang dry not worth the cost,0
2723,After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model the dress they sent me is not this dress it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter like a cross there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer it was scoop and if you pulled it down the neck went up the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here is rava the length measured at not the st,0
2724,First off the pictures online hardly do these justice these pants are way cool they are soft have the perfect little pattern they have a great tie detail on the cuff they are higher waist which is always more comfy and they are super stylish just like the other reviewer i am occasionally hesitant on drop crotch pantsbut i was so drawn to these im glad i have them a shot because they are way better than i expected these are worth the buy,1
2725,I love everything about this jacket so much that i had to buy three colors greyrustteal not only is it figure flattering its warm water repellent easily layered and well made the little pop of color contrast added to the stripe seam makes it unique i would say sizing is tts to a bit large the only thing that would improve the coat is better finishing of the hems,1
2726,Theres no doubt that this tee is sheer i found that a nude bra is sufficient in overcoming the issue the fit is true to size with just enough room for drape without being too oversized the beachy theme will be perfect come warm weather,1
2727,I was really excited to get this dress and to my dismay when i pulled it out of the package i could tell i would be disappointed i tried it on and i was correctit looked like i was wearing a huge tent i returned it,0
2728,Great fit the fabric is supple and of good quality has a fasionable look to it but is also very very comfortable cant beat that,1
2729,The picture does no justice to this stellar piece its extremely comfortable and looks extremely chic its very s studio look and ive received tons of compliments at the price point its worth it,1
2730,This jumper is gorgeous i usually dont instantly spend almost on one piece without contemplating but as soon as i tried this on i fell in love i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller i am for reference and even at its barely short enough to not be too long on me so if you are an inch or two taller i would recommend the pe,1
2731,This is a beautiful jacket the fabric is soft and drapes wonderful truly a great addition to any staple in your wardrobe i am having the sleeves shortened as i prefer a more length,1
2732,Contrary to the first review i find this top to be gorgeous the fabric has a silkiness to it with a slightly heavier weight the lace thru neckline is beautifully done the eyelets are highquality the fit has flow like on the model but still a bit of shape not the formless fit that some blouses like this have i love the open sleeves i am lbs b and am happy with the xs,1
2733,When i first put this dress on i immediately thoughtoh no i cant pull this off at least not without a cow to milk but this dress is so comfortable the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen fits true to size i got a size my usual size and i have gained a fe,1
2734,Im a big fan of the idea of jumpsuits and rompers but so often they go wrong this one was an unexpected surprise im size medium and the medium fit well and was actually super flattering the waist is cinched just so that its very slimming the roll tab cuff is a cute touch and is probably higher on me than the model but adorable none the less great quality too love,1
2735,I bought this to wear in the warm climates when you go indoors it is always freezing i also travel a lot and wanted something light weight to wear on the plane and airport wore it the first day all day with jeans and top lots of compliments i was worried that driving in the car it would get torn or snagged didnt loved it so much going to by another one similar and have on again,1
2736,Runs a bit small but this top is super soft like all the cloth and stone tops great for all seasons,1
2737,I ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event one petite one the style color and cut are all perfect one not so minor downfall however the zippers on both dresses were faulty they both broke in the same spot both during the first time just trying them on i cant get either of them to even budge now will either need to take back or get fixed very sad about this,0
2738,This is my kind of clothing item i love linen stripes pockets and a loose look in an over piece it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style it does not have any neck closure which may bother some i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p,1
2739,I adore this dress i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times rare for me it is so easy to throw on and yet its stylish and flattering i dont have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this when i bought it it was knotted on one side in the front thats the only way i wear it now it just adds something to it and gives it more shape ive washed it several times laid flat to dry and it has held up well im definitely bookmarking this to buy,1
2740,I was really excited about this dress i had only seen it online and it looked like the perfect transitional piece casual or dress up when it arrived in the mail the feel of the fabric was great and i slipped it on and it was so comfy i felt like i was wearing a nightdress unfortunately it hung like that too the material sags in places it shouldnt i have a lb frame and i ordered an extra small and both my husband and sister said it was unflattering and urged me to send it back,0
2741,I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection always the perfect fit and quality fabric im on the taller side at and found this to fit perfectly yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room awesome,1
2742,I ordered the orange version in size xl it fits true to size the fit on me matches the online photos its so comfortable to wear i love the unique details of it ive washed airdried it too it retained its size the color is outstanding its such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person theres more of a darker orange tint to it ive gotten a lot of use out of this tee hopefully itll come back in the fall in more colors,1
2743,Take a look at this dress in person or on instagram the model photos on this website make it look washed out and bridal irl the lace is a gorgeous ivory tone that looks great casual and dressed up ill be wearing this with leather and denim i chose the smallest of my size range and it fits very comfortably if you are busty you may want to size up i am c and i bought size,1
2744,I absolutely love this dress i am and pounds and the extra large was way too big the large was perfect the fabric is substantial but the fit is loose and swingy so it is good for the atlanta heat and humidity i want to wear this every day,1
2745,This is the perfect summer top lightweight and breezy looks great either tucked in to jeans or shorts or worn loose loved the blue one so i came back to get the red one i would recommend buying one size smaller than usual,1
2746,I really liked the dress on line but i didnt appreciate how lovely it was until i received it it fit perfectly and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork,1
2747,Theres something majorly wrong with the way the armholes are cut i cant move my arms in this dress otherwise the fit was fine the a line cut of the dress is great if ur trying to hide a few pounds other than that the does nothing for your figure i found this dress to be true to size in an xsp im lbs and dont buy it i know its tempting with the sale price,0
2748,I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants at the tunic felt like it added height and even though im a f the top fit well across the bust i tried on the large first and it felt very comfortable but a bit big the medium fit a little more snugly but was more proportional in the arms so i purchased it insteadthe neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst,1
2749,Im always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs but this one was perfect it didnt ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips its very flattering,1
2750,I have been looking for a summer dress with a bit of a chic flair to it i was thinking black tank top dress after weeks of hunting for the idea in my head i started to branch out i reluctantly tried this on thinking it would be baggish plain and possibly too short wow was i wrong this dress is everything more wear with some wedges belt it although it doesnt need it at all layer a high neckline lace top over it the possibilities are endless although i loved the green the b,1
2751,I had this on my wish list but saw it as a on of on black fridayand it just happened to be my sisz p it fit me perfect if anything it runs a little big but it is great to layer it can be worn sipped over a cami with lace showing or as a regular cardijacket over first layer the detailing is loely even tho it is off today i got it with the off store wide sale my size sold out before this promo so i am very glad i got it when i did just in time for all the christmas,1
2752,It is the cutest detailed little white top i recommend this because you can wear it anywhere and dress it up with a scarf,1
2753,Fit and flare pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down wish other colors were available online,1
2754,I was very nervous to buy this top but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip i am a ddd it past my waist i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nyloncotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear def,1
2755,Very very boxy designcut try on first or buy knowing you are likely to return beautiful skirt but if you dont have the right body typemeasurements will not flatter you at all,0
2756,I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy im tall and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled its a very versatile piece with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater either look is nice i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version also the fabric doesnt feel thick but it is very insulating and,1
2757,The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable but they are not flattering at all they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the fold over portion was not necessary,0
2758,Great comfy shirt long enough that i can wear it with leggings,1
2759,I got this in the teal and the color is beautiful and i get so many compliments definitely size down i am athletic and usually a m and i ordered a small,1
2760,Omg i love this sweater it is minimalistic yet romantic my mother inlaw bought this for me last may when she was visiting and one for herself i saw it today at the store in white and i snatched it up i will wear this for years i did not see until now that is is meant to be worn with the ties in the back ive been wearing it with the ties in the front what a bonus that there are ways to wear this wonderful sweater i will wear these pieces for many many years,1
2761,Such a great dress fit is flattering the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes thrilled with purchase,0
2762,I love this pajama combo it is super cute and comfortable,1
2763,This sweater is unique and really pretty i got so many compliments and i felt really girlie wearing it it is so fun,1
2764,While this top does fit very loose it is very cute and can be relaxed or you can dress it up it is shorter in the front and longer in the back which makes the shirt take on a flattering look i bought the green color and it is a very rich color it will be perfect for fall you may consider ordering a size down if your regular size tends to fit loose,1
2765,Retailer does it again im constantly looking for pieces that will work for a day at the office and then a night out and this skirt is perfect you cant really tell in the pictures but there is a larger slit that separates the grey material from the black which makes the skirt have more of a statement it runs true to size and the material is thick enough that it will do great in winter,1
2766,These undergarments are comfortable streamlined and well made this bra holds up well without wires i am a b and wear a small it is a bit tight at first but form fits after one wear after trying one bra and i ordered more then i researched the brand and bought camis to match i love how all the colors and styles are interchangeable,1
2767,I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on it is so big on the bottom it looks like a tent i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big sad,0
2768,I am so happy with this chemise the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft i like that the straps are adjustable allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me its definitely my new favorite,1
2769,I bought this in the reddish color i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps its shape i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as im going to wear it a lot,1
2770,I wanted to love this top looks so comfy and cute but hangs like a bag going back,0
2771,These pants are so greatstylebeautiful soft fabric and love the length i am i found the rise to be low and like the fact that that they sit at the hips i had to size up from my usual size in this brand very flattering and comfortable,1
2772,Just picked this up at a storehad a terrible time deciding between the plaid and the chambray but went with the chambray super soft fabric and not too short for a year old im lbs and d and the medium is perfect sometimes i wear a small but have broad shoulders so need the m in this ill wear without a beltit falls nicely and is very flattering,1
2773,This tank is super amazing very versatile wore to work with dress pants and flats and wore out to dinner with jeans and heels a bit out of my comfort zone since it is a swing tank but love the color and cut perfect for professional life and going out on the town i did choose a petite in this due to the long armholes even though i have a long torso for my body size,1
2774,This white blouse is absolutely stunning in person i wore it with a nude strapless bra note to self remove makeup before blouse otherwise its all over your blouse,1
2775,I went to the store to try on a jumpsuit and ended up with these instead while the jumpsuit was really cute i thought these would be more versatile as far as i can tell they are the same style as the pradollano tapered loungers by hei hei these were so cute and comfy i bought both they can easily be dressed up with a jacket and heels or worn casually with a tee and sandals i think these are much cuter in person than online there is a little red design in the pants which is hard to see in,1
2776,This basketweave bikini top in fractals red by mara hoffman is my favorite right now soft fully lined and reversible to pale pink as are the matching basketweave bikini bottoms the pattern looks like a vibrant watercolor painting with some fuzzy edges i got the size s according to the size guide on the mara hoffman site im currently ish without a bra on bra size d c even a dd if i can find it the front coverage is perfect it also fits around the back but i,1
2777,Its rare to find clothing made of quality fabrics and this is a fine soft wool blend the design is feminine without being overthetop and the fit is slightly loose as pictured on the model i would not recommend wearing it with a belt as pictured it makes it look too trendy and detracts from the shape of the cardigan which is beautiful on its own just skimming the body it is a perfect topper and can work for daytime or an evening out really lovely and one of the few things i decid,1
2778,Didnt even wait for a sale on this top so adorable and fits great i bought a medium and wear a small in most things i like that it is a touch big as it hangs better that way,1
2779,I like the detail in this cardigan the shape is true to the fit on the model of the main picture the sleeves are a bit long however i am and lbs i ordered and kept the xxsp great staple item,1
2780,I can tell this is will be a go to shirt this summer simple lines yet a little different style soft stripes slits on the side seams and short but not too short that it bares the stomach it will look great with jeans dressier with slim white pants or skirt or a pair of nice shorts i dont usually go for buttondown shirts but this one was a bit unusual and caught my eye immediately the fabric is soft yet holds its shape,1
2781,I love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue also it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy overall a darling top,1
2782,I just purchased this cardigan it is better in person than the picture the fit is fabulous it is very versatile it can be worn with many different options definitively be wearing often,1
2783,The shirt was better than it actually looked online the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it its something i can probably fix just a little disappointed receiving in that shapei would recommend this top very flattering and dressy if you want it to be,1
2784,Got this on a whim and boy im very pleased its flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather size up as mentioned by other reviewers,1
2785,I love love love this top and have received many compliments if anything it runs small i wear size and a d bra and the s was roomy,1
2786,Nice print and comfortable shirt,1
2787,I found this top to run very large i wear a medium in most retailer tops but often a large in other brands i had to return this for a small it was worth the effort however extremely cute top that i can see wearing on its own or under a blazer for a night out,1
2788,Love this coat beautiful pattern and thick enough to keep you warm with a lining inside i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly in the arms and overall length i read other comments about the button being too low but i didnt find this to be true i liked the lower button as it allows you to show some of what you have underneath,1
2789,I was surprised how great this blouse looks on the color and texture are awesome very well made but runs a tad small this will be my new go to when i open my closet,1
2790,I love this dress so much very detailed and comfortable looks great with the pilcro vest,1
2791,This is a great shirt fits perfect and super comfortable but you feel stylish and pretty,1
2792,I was looking for a comfortable top that looks puttogether and cute for work and this one fits the bill i couldnt decide between black or white so i got both if i had to choose i would stick with the black because its more slimming particularly for those of us with a large bust its not as heavy or stiff of a material as it appears in the pic which i like but it still has structure great basic with some flair i got the small my normal retailer size and it fit perfectly,1
2793,I love this tee as others have noted the pink is really more of a coral orange which is what i was hoping for i wish they had another good color for a redhead because i would buy it,1
2794,This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it but sadly the fit of this number is really off it looks more like a tent it must have been clipped in the back or something i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good,0
2795,I love the off the shoulder trend but dont like having to wear a strapless bra so this style caught my eye it is cute and different and people compliment me on it swingy but flattering and i got the turquoise but i like it so much i just ordered another one in the black and white stripe,1
2796,I am very petite lbs and find this to be pretty formfitting not in a bad way a rare feat for petites it is very comfortable soft sweaterlike material and texture which does make the dress feel slightly cheap to me but it doesnt make it look cheap its also beautifully patterned in person pretty true to the online photo with the only difference being the dress is darker in person so i dont feel the blue stands out as much as it does on the online photo the length is,1
2797,I love this top i love the detail in the front and the v back its simple and sexy easy to dress up or wear casually i ordered an xs and found it to fit perfect im and lbs i ordered the olive green color which i love i dont typically wear red so that wasnt an option for me i do wish it came in more colors,1
2798,I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants the material is a fun texture i didnt have any problems with the arm holes but this may be due to being less full in the bust area,1
2799,I usually wear a size medium in angel of the north but this was very small i would need to have ordered a size large or xl to have it fit pretty but returning,0
2800,Love the design of this denim dress so unique i did buy a size larger than i would have normally looked at based on reviews if on the fence go up but do get this one it has no stretch so a size waist measures flat with under the arms not really for big busted girls i am and the length is right at lower knee worth the sale price for sure,1
2801,Dont pass this one up ladiesthe fabric is casual and relaxed but the drawstringlike collar gives it class and flirt all at the same time i paired it with a jersey mini skirt and the way the banding at the waist falls on this top made it look like one whole dress i can wear this with cropped jeans shorts anything truly a homerun im lbs and small fit perfectly,1
2802,This top came in the mail today and did not disappoint it feels very light and luxurious and the color is just divine i got the deep red color and it is beautiful it can be dressed up or dressed down i ordered my usual small and it fit tts,1
2803,I absolutely love this jacket i bought it and wore it to work to next day and received tons of compliments it is easy to move in as i have ark that required stretching and bending alot i am pounds and xs fit a well,1
2804,The color says red but its more like a rust im so it was long and would need to be tailored and the fabric is so thin i was afraid it would rip if it got caught on anythingfinally returned it without it making it out the door,0
2805,Love these lounge pants i live in florida and was worried they might be too heavy not the case at all very soft and lightweight so comfortable,1
2806,Perfect party dress well constructed bra hidden at arms and on top what more can you ask for i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on im normally a but the while fitted looked amazing and didnt pull,1
2807,Awesome pants they look a lot better in person than in these pictures i got it in dark blue they are very comfortable and can be used day to night if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option its a bit more dressy than other models still look casual and fun i may end up getting a couple more for myself,1
2808,I purchased this blazer and its so comfortable it runs small i am usually a size but had to get it in size i will be getting a lot of use out of this blazer it can be worn professionally with skirt or solid color dress or casual with jeans the fabric so very soft almost like a sweatshirt,1
2809,Beautiful caught my eye online i had to order then reorder in a smaller size but it is wonderful colors are beautiful,1
2810,This product i better than the pic nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it,1
2811,Love love love this piece very flowy but made of good material glad i purchased this item,1
2812,Great style and the color can be dressed up or down i love it,1
2813,Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain not as displayed,0
2814,This dress is so beautiful i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person the fit the embroidery the lovely fall colors makes this a perfect dress all the way around,1
2815,I bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frameim i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays would def recommend this dress,1
2816,Never would have thought i would love it so much based on the picture online but saw it in person and its so cute colors are very rich in person even the soft pink not a big pink gal works so well with the other colors great quality with full lining i lucked out and picked it up for a steal on clearance with another off just love it,1
2817,Absolutely stunning dress true to size and flows like a dream,1
2818,Every year im excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses i love this one with the longer length slimming fit and pattern placement and cozy soft fabric delightful inspires reveries of castles and legends yes i looked up what eira stands for and went with it highly recommended fit is generously tts,1
2819,I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on i promptly went online and ordered two more ive gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them great for looking put together with no fuss people that have commented theres were destroyed in the wash didnt read the care label which says dry clean,1
2820,I loved this top when i laid eyes on it online and in person it did not disappoint it is a beautiful and unique top the color is striking and the style is adorable i cant wait to wear this with some flare jeans and espadrilles,1
2821,Its a very light material so you can wear it early spring or early fall when its still fairly warm such a cute jacket has no zipper or buttons though so definitely more for stylelook than for a crazy rainy day use love it,1
2822,This sweater looked so promising with the tie waist and pretty lacy edging but turned out to be a disappointment it was much shorter than it looks in the photos and barely came to my hips and the plum color was much darker than i expected more of a dull brownishburgundy,0
2823,Super simple top thats comfy i like a looser fit and its boxy both things i like seems like it will be a staple piece,1
2824,I have of these now by the same designer its comfortable and will be a staple in my closet for summer early fall and spring it is a little on the long end but with platform heels its perfect,1
2825,These are my favourite sleep pants the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band didnt cut in my sides,1
2826,When i saw this sweater online i honestly didnt think it was really anything special however when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color kind of an off white pinkish i decided to give it a try i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter glad i decided to give it a try,1
2827,These pants are so soft and super comfythey look great with heels and sandals they will be my go to this summer for surewould love them in black or navy,1
2828,I saw this in the store and loved the feel of the fabric but did not want to pay full price i was very happy when it went on sale the top clings nicely without feeling tight i got sp as i worried the neckline would slip off fits perfectly fabric has a very slight sheen i just hope it holds up to washing and caution is needed as you may create pulls with jewelry if careless,1
2829,Love the material pockets length i wear petitie im etc i usually wear a medium but this dress runs incredibly large i was drowning in it and sadly had to return it size one or two sizes down if you want to purchase,1
2830,This is the oddest fitting pullover there is too much fabric around the chest it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness is that a word i gave it away,0
2831,Beautiful in pictures and i loved it before i tried it on as the other reviews state it is short and wide i like the top so much i am going to try to add some gathering across the back to offer some shape otherwise it is an unflattering shapeless box,0
2832,Definitely shorter than expected but a super light airy and comfy dress for summer nights a must for summer dinner parties,1
2833,I absolutely love this dress it is super soft and flattering for my body type petite and curvy though i wish it did come in petite as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better but that didnt stop me from purchasing as thats an easy alteration very flattering love it,1
2834,This is a gorgeous buttondown the colors are stunning i love the mix of blue and brown the fabric is super soft and drapes just right i feel the this shirt runs true to size im an xxs petite and it fit perfect this one is a winner,1
2835,Love this blouselooks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made looks feminine and edgy on may size out for taller gals bc it is a bit on the shorter length i am and the length is just right on me untucked the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high,1
2836,This is a really nice white buttonup top per usual the cloth ant stone material is awesome and a machine washable blouse the side buttons are a really cute feature as well i found this top fit true to size and i took my usual xs,1
2837,I stalked the website to get this in a pxxs it runs a tad large this is a beautiful garment i receive many many compliments every time i wear it in fact nearly everyone comments on it it is surprisingly warm for a cape i love that it works so well over my bulkier sweaters as others have mentioned the buttons are a little difficult but i found that they got easier with multiple wearings i disagree with the reviewer that feels the collar must be worn up i actually like the collar down,1
2838,For reference i am and lbs the small fits nicely the style is flattering i have a big rib age so as with many back zip styles that area is a bit tight when i sit down not too bad though ican wear it to work and out for a date both colors are a bit subdued but i will enhance the pink or blue floral tones with a sweater jacket and jewelry,1
2839,Love these soft cozy leggings fit like a glove perfect for weekends lounging sleeping during cold winter weather want more of the same,1
2840,I fell in love with this shirt the moment i saw itunfortunately when i went to put it on there was a hole running down the seam in the back i went to store to exchange wore the shirt and someone tells me i have two holes in the back of my shirt horrified i went home took a look both holes along the seam i will be returning this i really liked this shirt,0
2841,I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored my usual size fit perfectly but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long which is nice for those of you that need more lengthgiven that i usually am in skinnies i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom but not too much these will work well with a variety of looks making the price tag well worth it,1
2842,I got this sweater in white and i love it the photo online doesnt do it justice its not frumpy at all and looks looks great zipped up because of the slanted zipper my boyfriend calls it my claire underwood sweater,1
2843,I generally wear a small or medium in tops and decided to get the mediumlarge its oversized but it lays very nicely and doesnt look frumpy the back of the shirt is exactly as it looks in the picture the front of the shirt is more of a solid blue than is shown but still lovely,1
2844,Perfect for day at the beach im and the length is just right above knee not too short fresh and cool cotton comfortable feel,1
2845,I bought this in my usual size small im a waist b and it fits perfectly its a little loose and boxy but still structured and cute it fits me like the model i dont find it itchy at all and the embroidery is just gorgeous this is perfect for transitioning from summer to fall,1
2846,This shirt was just really missing something for me i originally liked the patter of the small dots all over the fabric especially with the sleeves being more sheer than the rest of the blouse i also am tending to gravitate toward clothes that hide my residual baby fat in my midsection however the tie is very high up on the neck and it made me feel like i was wearing a turtleneck i rarely wear turtle necks because they make me feel like i am choking in addition the bow seemed to be too t,0
2847,Just received first pair in brownlove them and ordered two more these tights actually stay up and you dont have to keep pulling on them throughout the day super comfortable and perfect weight not too thick and not too thin they will run so be careful when washing or putting them on,1
2848,Im not really sure what the big todo about the buttons is all about i was able to slip the blouse on over my head without undoing any of them with no problems yes the buttons are difficult but unless youre breastfeeding they shouldnt be a deal breaker the blouse is exactly what i was expecting so pretty feminine and flattering also though it is a tiny bit sheer i plan to wear it with a nude bra and no cami,1
2849,This coat is beautifully tailored and made in the usa of wool the color is vibrant it looks great when you need a longer coat for the cold its almost an outfit on its own lastly the size was perfect i ordered my normal and it fit like a glove,1
2850,Loved it i have receive so many compliments when i wear this it fit great,1
2851,Love this skirt the material is so soft and flowy but holds a nice aline shape i do agree with the other reviewers that this does run a bit small i am a waist and purchased a and i could probably have considered sizing up to the easily as well,1
2852,I absolutely love this dress i purchased it in my usual size petite and it looks as though it was made for me the combination of the placement of the pattern and the cut of the dress was quite figure flattering the only tiny issues i had were that the dress fell to the middle of my kneecaps and may need a hem in addition the dress takes a bit of maneuvering to get into due to the side zipper and the close fit despite these issues i feel that it is definitely worth buying and i will be k,1
2853,I love this dress it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me i am not the tallest person but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast its just something to be aware of i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess,1
2854,Since there was only one review on this i thought i would chime in i had been eyeing this for months and was able to get it on sale which was a plus since this had a pretty hefty price tag to start that being said the tailoring and detail work on it is just beautiful i am a little worried about how the knit will wear but not worried enough to return it as far as sizing goes i ordered a in the last byron lars dress and i am a in this too it fits snugly but a would have looked lumpy,1
2855,I bought this in size xl in the moss color it fits true to size its very comfortablethe fabric is soft i love the draping of this top im a pearshape and this type of cut is my favorite the moss color looks black online but is really a dark forest green id love to see this top made in other colors,1
2856,This is an extremely flattering dress i couldnt resist buying it even though i didnt come into the store looking for a dressier dress which i feel this is once i tried it on i had to purchase it its one of those things that i know i wont regret because at some point an occasion will show up that ill wear it to its soft comfy and flowing and accentuates the bodys curves without being too tight or clingy its a classic,0
2857,Love this tshirt the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps,1
2858,Nice quality soft fabric sleeves definitely make a unique statement the fit worked for me although it could have more room in hips for my hourglass figure got m size l was way too big i am d but the dress can definitely accomodate bigger chest the color are my favorites in this seasonwear it to stand out,1
2859,I think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years and this might be my new favorite one major improvement over years past is the fitit really is true to size rather than running large as has been the case in the past the material is a substantial stretchy jersey with a nice texture the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means its not sheer at all and it also a nice smooth fit skimming over lessthanperfect areas i also really appreciate,1
2860,I purchased this romper over a month ago and love it i ordered a s and would say that it is true to size it falls well and i love the blousy look on top it is expensive at full price but i purchased it with a promotional discount luckily before i washed this as the tag says handwash only i read the reviews in which some reviewers had said that they followed the directions and it still shrunk i let it sit in my hamper until today after i read online about using dryel and rayon dryel in,1
2861,I wanted to love this shirt so much i got this as a gift for christmas in the black the first time i wore the shirt of the buttons on the back fell off keep in mind that they are not decorative and they held the shirt together needless to say i was not so pleased to have my shirt fly open from the back retailer and their amazing customer service took this shirt back no problem but i wanted to give the fair warning,0
2862,I ordered this top black in both small and medium i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores as soon as i received the package and opened it up i knew i would keep this top it has a gorgeous texture to it a slight sheen and is well made its extremely comfortable as a tshirt would be but has more structure and looks very chic the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine i have a long tor,1
2863,This shirt is so small i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit dont waste your time on this shirt such a shame it could have been very cute,0
2864,This top was fun casual with flair it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost but i would just wear a bra of the same color and dont think anyone would notice i didnt buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee in my opinion,1
2865,I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on it feels great on is well made and flattering you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together much cuter in real life too it does run a little small id go up a size if youre getting the white so it wont cling too much,1
2866,Im normally a small in retailer tops i ordered a small and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper more fitted part it all went horribly wrong from there the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent instantly adding a good pounds to my frame this was such a disappointment as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality,0
2867,Perfect cozy sweater nice details exactly what i wanted to upgrade from sweatshirts,1
2868,I ordered this tee despite the price the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor nice concept for a tee but failed in quality and value it was returned,0
2869,I love these shorts nice material good fitting and great look i sized up usually an and i ordered a based on others reviews and it was the right choice these are a great casual short or dressed up with shoes and a nice shirt,1
2870,This sweater is a cute design but did not work for me i am and this is way to shortcropped and looks awkward the quality was so so it looked stretched out in the front its getting returned,0
2871,Bought this dress based on the other reviews and was glad i did fabric is very nice and soft it drapes nicely hiding my tummy trouble area very flattering and not too short i could wear it with a blazer to work and also out on a date night happy with my purchase,1
2872,These tailored front flowy back tops dont always work this is long enough to wear with leggings and quite flattering,1
2873,I am usually a size o and ordered and xs due to the band in the center not much give it was a little difficult to shimmy over my hips but the body fit perfectly when i got passed that part that being said the cup design is a hot mess i am a bc cup size and the top on this could not handle it i felt fully exposed i thought maybe if i went a size up i could get a little more coverage the body felt ok on the small but the cups were still just too small i still felt to exposed they are,0
2874,I love retailer sweaters in fact i believe all my sweaters are from retailer this cardigan is really nice and im so glad i bought it it will work well with skirts dresses pants its well made and soft and comfy highly recommended,1
2875,This is not your basic white tee the ruffle and seam down the front add visual interest cute alone or paired with a sweater and statement necklace,1
2876,Gave this sweater to my mom this christmas and she has hardly taken it offso cozy and cute,1
2877,I am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it i am and pounds and normally wear a size in dresses i would normally buy a small but sized down to an xs and it was perfect its a beautiful dress and very flattering,1
2878,I fell in love with this dress online and ordered it despite some of the reviews that claimed it cut too high in the leg and couldnt be worn as a dress i thought it was lovely enough to wear as a long shirt even if that was the case however when it arrived the side hems were not cut too high for me and i have successfully worn it as a dress receiving many compliments along the way im and a quarter inches lbs i ordered an extra small and it fits perfectly the fabric is soft a,1
2879,I ordered this sweater in the pink color in a small and xsmall in order to see which was the best fit i was really looking forward to getting it because it looked so great online like it had a nice flow the cute zipper and was a good match for a pink and grey skirt that i have i was really disappointed the sweater doesnt flow like it does in the picture it kind of billows out in the front and back and isnt flattering i have a small build and frankly i usually look good in sweaters,0
2880,Saw this in store today and had to have it the pink is a really bright pink definitely more of a hot pink than it appears in the image online i am a solid and i bought this in an so it definitely runs a size large highly recommend,1
2881,Such a cute dress i ordered the black version im large busted dd and the slip thankfully fit sometimes it doesnt im and went ahead with the regular not petite version and i have to say i think the petite would have been too short the dress comes to the top of my knees as photographed on the model highly recommend,1
2882,Im a curvy size and these pants fit beautifully theyre a fairly narrow cropped leg with a slight flare im happy and ordering another pair,1
2883,This is such a beautiful shirt for me tts i bought the size b it is a very detailed and tailored shirt so i can understand if your busty why you may have to size up the attention to detail along with the embroidered butterflies sets this shirt a step above average the color is an odd shade of olive but i like it and the butterflies have areas that you can see through but not in an immodest way i do not feel the need to wear anything under it,1
2884,Beautiful dress the details are lovely it feels a little bit like a nightgown i always wear a slip bust does run a little small so i unbutton the first few buttons armholes feel a little small also,1
2885,I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brothers summer wedding in the south and i cant wait to wear it cotton material has a touch almost like linen but not rough nice and hearty fabric tangerine color is beautiful more salmon than coral wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoesthe shoes arent on the retailer site anymore but i found them at my local store just perfect,1
2886,Love this shirt i got the whiteyellow one and with a pair of dark jeans and booties i was ready for anything i have an hourglass type figure and sometimes with flowy shirts that is hidden but this shirt somehow subtly emphasized that in an attractive way,1
2887,Such an adorable top very flattering despite its rather full style just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large i normally wear a small sometimes medium i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly,1
2888,I was really disappointed with these pants they were a thinner fabric than expected with little to no stretch they were very tight around my legs and huge at the waist sadly they will be going back,0
2889,Love this dress its so soft not to short like some retailer dresses great transition piece im a fan of bell sleeves cant wait to wear this with boots tights this fall,1
2890,These are great quality and hang very nice tts im and about lbs and the fit and hit just above the ankle,1
2891,Just picked up this cardigan in the heather charcoal so i can wear it in the fall and winter the design on the border is well done and will show off whatever you wear under this cardi sleeves are snug and long but can easily be pushed up to length,1
2892,Loved this top great design comfortable and unique soft material,1
2893,This initially caught my eye online and then i immediately tried it on when our store received it the dress is simple and well structured with a tight sweater weave that almost has a hold u in feel therefore it fits like a glove on,1
2894,Love this top purchased in a size medium my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more will be great in spring and summer cooler days in summer,1
2895,This top is an amazing go to piece and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto i will say that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear therefore it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time good staple for a great price,1
2896,Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper its very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailers picture doesnt match the actual product it does fit true to size however,0
2897,I saw this dress and immediately started daydreaming about wearing it while honeymooning in italy along the amalfi coast or the cinque terre with my husband and then i tried this dress on and immediately woke up the cut is a disaster the quality is terrible and the dress just plain didnt work the strips of elastic were sewn unevenly giving the appearance that there was one large breast and one nonexistent breast the neckline was so long that it had to have the elastic run over the outsi,0
2898,This maxi is perfect the neckline is sexy but not too sexy yay for normal bra and the waistline is flattering the skirt isnt very full but the ruffle effect at the bottom gives it nice movement it could easily be dressed up or dressed down i cant imagine that this wouldnt be flattering on anyone it fit totally true to size for me,1
2899,Spotted this beauty in my local store hanging grrr which made it stretch out note that its made of linen cotton and acrylic so its not heavy its weighty anyways it seemed to run large just due to gravity so i ended up ordering it so it wasnt all stretched out its got a beautiful aline cut perfect for us bottomheavy gals love the colored thread woven throughout worth the extra,1
2900,This too is easy to wear skins the body nicely the color is very pretty some of the retailer tops have issues for me because i find the necklines too low not this one the placket lays flat doesnt expose excessive cleavage the details on the blouse are pretty subtle the top washed well in the delicate cute just hang it to dry and it looks great,1
2901,I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket and the removable collar gives even more versatility i am short so i opted for regular xs im ftin b waist hips the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight i love military green color its a happier neutral than black or brown without saying it goes with everything and flatters all body types,1
2902,These pants are so great i am and the talls are actually a hair too long but no complaints just wish they made every color available in tall i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work as far as sizing goes i wear a in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a in these,1
2903,I love this top it is a cool style mix between mensware and womens the collar is gorgeous making it feminine and beautiful i normally wear a size large in retailer i would size down returning my large for a medium a beautiful shirt for many occasions,1
2904,I love this vest its perfect for day and dress up for the evening very comfy,1
2905,I sized down in this and it fit perfectly i normally opt for petite in skirts but i stuck to regular for this skirt and it was much more flattering adorable and well made,1
2906,An interesting design in a highquality garment fits true to size on me and is great for layering very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i wouldve gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece,1
2907,This cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks i love the fit of the small and smallmedium build would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home,1
2908,I love this dress the fit is spectacular and if there were any problems with the hook and eyes in the front coming undone as stated in previous reviews it has been corrected the dress does not come undone and it moves beautifully with you walking sitting and bending i wore this to a holiday party and the color is just amazing a coppery and browngold pattern very flattering i will purchase more byron lars dresses for certain,1
2909,It is such a cute design and very soft and comfortable but the picture for this product is very deceiving it looks like the sweater is fairly long in the pictured product page but it is considerably short i am nearly six foot tall but thought by this picture it would be lengthy not at allit is a beautiful sweater might work better for a shorter stature,0
2910,I wanted to add my two cents because i was worried when ordering the pants from previous reviews that they would be to tight as it had been suggested they run small i didnt find that to be the case and think they run true to size,1
2911,Love the bright colors made really well super soft and vibrant,1
2912,This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit length and color the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy feels soft like a boucle type knit the sleeves are length and the weight is maybe a mediumweight not super warm i wouldnt see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter but for right now its perfect fit is tts,1
2913,I absolutely love this piece its a beautiful and chic piece that is perfect for any occasion,1
2914,These shorts work well for shopping running errands or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers they are not too short and are true to size,1
2915,I love this dress i generally wear size and the medium fits perfect im a curvy lady and this dress fits great ive received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much,1
2916,These pants are beautiful great fit and great fabric really comfortable and elegant i am tall and have a long torso so its nice to find pants that are high waisted,1
2917,Agree with previous reviewer i am usually an xs p in this brand lbs but i could not get the internal slip over my head the chest area was fitted i am a b but then the skirt was very full and loose i could have cut out the slip but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price,0
2918,When i spotted these online i knew i had to try them out in the past charlie pants have always been too baggy in the legs for me when trying the regular sizes on in the store well these are described as slim tailored in details so decided to order my usual size regular upon arrival they were baggy in the thigh area the rise was fine but the crotch area pardon me was a little on the short side buttons were difficult to slip into the buttonhole unbuttoning was a job guess the hol,1
2919,I feel like an indian princess in this dress it isnt very forgiving make sure you dont mind showing some skin but theres some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times great colors boyfriend loves it,1
2920,The is such a cute aline skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty im pounds and bought the regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist love this and the price,1
2921,When this arrived in the mail i knew there was a chance of a sheath dress working with my bodytype athletic on top larger on bottom i usually wear size in aline dresses and i found this dress size in the sale room and barely squeezed in ordered size and love it for ref lbs b the belt is adjustable which puts everything in place the front collar blends seamlessly into the sleeves and the brocade panels are such a great quality of material reminding m,1
2922,I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color size l my usual size im size unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy but loved the pattern and style so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better im very happy with my purchase,1
2923,I thought the sweater itself was beautiful but found the fabric to be stiff and itchy,0
2924,Love tiny i am lbs depending on the day and a a i also have a very long torso and tiny shirts are one of the few brands that are usually long enough for me this one however was a huge miss i ordered online in my usual tiny xs it was much too big around and felt shorter in the front than stated so it looked boxy on me however the worst part was the placket the description doesnt note that its held together with a tiny snap that snap takes nothing to undo and then,0
2925,I have been looking for a fallspring coat to wear when the weather is between and degrees this coat looks great in the pictures but so disappointing in reality the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft it is unlined so im not sure why youd even wear it if the weathers warm enough to wear a thin unlined jacket why not just wear a sweater the weight is not what i would expect at this price point even worse the design is terrible my husband who has a great eye,0
2926,The colors are amazing so vibrant and plentiful the arm holes are fairly generous but not bad i think it just adds to the loose fitting nature of the dress i got a medium im with a small chest medium is my norm for maeve the buttons in the back are difficult you need help getting on but getting off you can do solo this dress makes your shoulders look really good it sits in a very flattering way,1
2927,This dress is flattering comfortable and beautiful it hides my imperfections too currently my favorite dress,1
2928,You have to give this dress a try yes it runs small im usually a in retailer dresses dd lb i couldnt button the top button with my bra on but i could without it on it fit perfect every where else it is very flattering in every way its cotton lightweight and soft the flare does not have too much fabric and is actually slimming unlike other fit and flare dresses the sz fit more comfortable and i could wear my bra which looked better and gave my breasts a lift,1
2929,This is another one of those darned swing tops i cant even with this trend this shirt has such a nice printcolor palette going on but its ruined by the swing cuthenley combo it looked like i was a little kid wearing an oversized mens night shirtsmock i dont know it was just not at all flattering i ordered my regular size large and a medium would have worked and probably still been generously cut i disagree with a reviewer who said it might work for larger sizes this just made my,0
2930,Really cute top normally order a s or xs based on reviews i ordered a m and good fit,1
2931,I love these so very much by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull offbut very tastefully do i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve tshirt worth every penny if your size is available grab themyou will be happy you did,1
2932,Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months but fit feel great love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for active wear,1
2933,I am not sure who in the world could really wear this as a dress without belting itdefinitely a super weird cut extreme aframe the fabric is just absolutely gorgeous and it is so well made otherwise i thought about trying to size down but it would be too small in the shoulders for sure i am going to keep anyway ive already worn it with jeans and a tshirt and as a topper with a denim shirt dress it actually looked fantastic with both ill get a lot of wear out of it just not the way,1
2934,This tunic has nice soft fabric and nicely done embroidery that make it stand out its comfortable and the fabric is very nice but it is not flannel as advertised the tunic is made out of a doublegauze cotton which is a great fabric with a casual look,1
2935,This kimono is absolutely wonderful i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather goes with pretty much everything highly recommend,1
2936,This skirt is shimmery without being too much rich colors and perfect fit tts nice elastic middle so comfortable and gorgeous,1
2937,I purchased this top as a swim suit coverup and it is perfect i was counting on the model in the photo being tall so that the top would be longer on me and that was true great product,1
2938,This top is great it looks much better in person its still kind of a faded look but its not as light as shown here also the exact location of the plaid is different on each top it runs just a tiny bit large but i liked it loose so took my normal size there is another fabric lining the front in a very cute print will be a nice loose and cool top for summer love the tie in the back as well,1
2939,This pjs are adorable they run tts and are extremely comfortable,1
2940,I ordered online i sized up one size it fit perfect so flattering and so pretty then i tried to take it off and the zipper stuckbadly minutes later i was sadly packing it up to ship back the zipper is that awful,0
2941,I bought the red and it is gorgeous i love how it hangs heavy but fluid i usually wear a but i bought a and it was perfect,1
2942,I wore this unbuttoned with a moss green tla tank top faded ripped rolled up stevies with gladiator sandals and turquoise jewelry and it looked great this is an amazing piece for your summer wardrobe that can be worn so many ways,1
2943,Wore it to a cousins wedding loved it probably one of the best dresses that i have ever worn lots of compliments felt great dancing the night away,1
2944,While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head i did not find it to be too difficult i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day its quite comfortable too i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size,1
2945,I ordered this in grey first but didnt care for the black lace so decided to try the creambeigeneutral and i just love it i have areas i am trying to cover up and this really fits the bill without looking too much like an oversized tunic the back is the clincher different and surprising washes excellently but i did line dry as i was afraid of shrinkage if there are any left you wont be sorry and the neutral color looks good on almost everyone,1
2946,Im about and normally about lbs so i purchased the small im currently months prego but i couldnt resist this jacket i purchased anyway and although it doesnt fit over my belly right now im looking forward to being able to wear it soon it will be perfect for the chilly office or a casual day the fabric is beautiful with just the right amount of stretch like others have said it has a bit of a navyish tint to to it so its not truly black thanks retailer for offering anothe,1
2947,I like the warm neutral color of this piece and the figureskimming shape with waist definition it is a soft and warm layering piece sadly the sleeves were too long for me and have long zippers at the cuffs so rolling them up didnt work i wish i had caught this piece while they still had my size in petite,1
2948,I love simplicity in clothing and this tee fits the bill i put it on and instantly feel basic elegance,1
2949,I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such this really does have a lot going on i usually wear a in skirts and based on reviews went up one size it still saw way up near my chest i think even an would be too small its sooooo tiny at the waist probably buy sizes and sizes up from your own also the skirt flares super wide at the sides it doesnt sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand its like a skirt,0
2950,I love this flirty well fitted dress quality material,1
2951,I got this shirt in black and its perfect for the office i ordered a medium which i thought was a little on the larger side well made the details make it an interesting top,1
2952,This is a lovely sweater the moss color however is really camel which is what the photo indicates it fits tts is all cashmere and is knit in a brioche stitch that gives it loft and texture that can be seen well in the detail photo i am generally not a fan of raglan sleeves but in this case it works with the overall construction of the sweater one that features interesting decreases lines and angles it is very soft warm and lightweight and can be worn as a casual piece or dressed,1
2953,Love this top the quality is great and the pattern is even cuter in person im lbs and bought my normal size s which fits perfectly its pretty flouncy and roomy which is nice because it hides my postbaby tummy especially love how the back covers my bottom which means i can wear my skinny black leggings underneath definitely recommend,1
2954,I love the paisley print very soft and comfy flutter sleeve look is cuteperfect weekend wear,1
2955,This is a great summer top love the way it drapes and the quality of the material bought the ivory and went back for the rust but my size is sold out my only complaint is that it doesnt come in way more colors,1
2956,I love these socks so much i ordered the beige and red pair with the polar bear design and they are my new favorite socks these are comfy with great stretch and just the right amount of cushion however the best feature is the cute little frill around the cuff i want to order more but i dont care for the other designs as much as the pair i ordered instead i will be keeping an eye on this brand to see what they come out with next,1
2957,Love this dress in the orange print i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersomeit is but im willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress and it is adorable easy and comfortable to wearand i just love the orange pattern print took my usual size,1
2958,This blouse is a perfect creation perfectweight cotton many many details and color all perfectly executed theres fullness to the body so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot humid locations this summer and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look theres no mistaking quality when you look at this piece i bought the medium for my f size blousetee frame this is the blouse you will have for years and you will enjoy,1
2959,Im stunned by the bad reviews by others i love this dress it is an amazing feminine detailed exceptional work of art and lucky for me who usually takes s and s that it runs big there is stretch to it and it fits great lucky lucky me,1
2960,This skirt is great and you cant beat it for the price it fits more like a pencil skirt on me and looks sort of aline on the model very nice work appropriate skirt though the slit comes higher than i expected my thighs are tattooed so i put on some black tights and it looks great with a blouse and cardigan,1
2961,Its embarrassing to admit but i am buying this top for the second time because ive misplaced the first one and i fear that if i wait too long trying to recover it that it will be a sold out item and ill never be able to have it again hence the decision to repurchase i just love it that much im sure that now that i have the second top the first one will mysteriously show up lolanyway this top is a very flattering off the shoulder style one of the things i really like about it is,1
2962,I was really excited to get this top in the mail unlike other reviewers i didnt find that the top fit small but i thought that the tight fit across the shoulders and chest didnt look good with the billowy torso of the top i think this top would be flattering on really thin girls but im very tall and broad shouldered so it didnt look as good on me,0
2963,This is a beautiful sweater the photo doesnt do it justice the model is wearing too large a size i wear a l in moth and definitely looked better in the medium the price is too high but the savings thanksgiving weekend helps to blunt the pain the lining is soft but was wrinkled on all the sweaters the coloring is very flattering and with care this should be able to be worn for years it can be used as a dressy coat sweater or fabulous over casual clothes i wasn particularly impress,1
2964,Normally i like to purchase from the store so i can try things on first but this top wasnt available locally i guessed on a medium im and very curvy and the medium fits just like the picture on the model just a hint of a sleeve and nice and drapeyloose over the body the embroidery is just beautiful the only reason im not giving stars for quality is that i had to sew two buttons onto the back my top came without them,1
2965,This swimsuit is amazing i am and about lbs and ordered a small however i am returning it for an extra small just a personal preference as i like my swimsuits a bit snug so they dont get loose when wet the fabric is very forgiving and stretchy which is why im exchanging for a smaller size i can slide the size small up my legs with ease but the fabric is also very sturdy so it seems i havent worn it in the water yet obviously overall very cute and surprisingly flatte,1
2966,Fits true to size and has a great shape i get compliments each time i wear it glad i purchased it,1
2967,Want to combine super comfort with super style and quality stop here and buy these you will not be disappointed,1
2968,I absolutely love this blouse its easily one of my favorite retailer finds in several seasons it is quite roomy so anyone hoping for a more form fitting cut wont find it here this is the type of fit i prefer for summer though as missouri is just disgustingly humid and i cant stand to wear anything clingy once it heats up its sheer so a cami is required its also wrinkle prone but the fabric is almost like a gauze and is not meant to be perfectly pressed and crisp its perfect to thro,1
2969,This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me i would wear it as a slip or a nightie looking forward to wearing it,1
2970,The fabric is very nice on this wrap but it wears like a blanket,0
2971,For the sale price this is an amazing deal i tried the white version of this shirt on in a size because being on sale that was all they had available in the store it was unfortunately too large with the v of the shirt plunging rather low and the sleeves hanging off my shoulders and i didnt buy it when i came back a few days later i found this in a size in black i honestly dont know my shirt size in numbers but id consider this one a small to medium so id say its fairly true,1
2972,I really liked this tank i purchased it in the green i went with my regular size yes its boxy but its a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer im planning on using it on our vacation to the beach it is thin and soft,1
2973,These are nice dusty rose pants they have a great textured design on them they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch i will say they are not soft like sweatpants definitely feel like a polyblend but the look makes up for it the material is a little on the thin side and they are not linedbut not seethrough either,1
2974,This top is so beautiful and well made and the detailing in the back is gorgeous its unexpected and makes this piece really special it does run a tiny bit large ive gotten retailer chambray a before and they usually shrink a touch in the wash and then for just right i havent washed this yet but even a little large it fits well and hangs nicely without being overly baggy get this you wont regret it,1
2975,I saw this dress in my local retailer store and had to try it on i cannot say enough good things about this dress i love it like other reviewers said it runs very big i am pounds and usually wear a size but got this in a fits like a shirt dress should once i sized down,1
2976,Love this top perfect date night top you can dress it up with a cute pair of heels or wear it around doing errands in some flats,1
2977,I bought this to wear to holiday parties but it would work for any special occasion the embroidery is gorgeous and really pops on the black background the dress itself is a brushed cotton that is thick enough to not to show every bulge i said it runs tts i bought the size and normally would wear a or in retailer dresses the dress is fitted through the torso and flairs at the hips so you may want to size up or down depending on your body type i did not have any issue with the armhole,1
2978,This is a super cute tank fits good flowy and airy which is exactly what i had in mind for summer fits good,1
2979,First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person which i personally love over the tan i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas but they are holding up and not stretching out there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket overall if youre considering this jacket take the plunge like i did order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if youre hoping to layer,1
2980,I was excited to try this dress on in person and so glad i did its actually really cute the material is soft and super comfortable the dress hits just above the knee and the tie in the front accentuates your waist i was pleasantly surprised at how cute it really is im excited to wear this to work worth the price,1
2981,Ordered a size medium as i usually take a medium in retailer coats the wool is wonderful however the stripped bands are sewn into the fabric which add to the weight the coat has an odd shape not a line or straight the medium was large on me the bottom edges of the coat did not line up when buttoned and there was no inside hook or button to help even out the bottom edges sadly this coat will be returned,0
2982,I love this tee i am long waisted and so many tops right now that are on the shorter side look silly on me so i was happy to find this im b and bought and xs it fits perfectly the asymmetry is darling and the stripes are perfect for spring it is a nice weight and i felt totally worth the money it looks great so far after three washes and hang dries,1
2983,This is better than the original tla t shirts from last summer better qualitynot sheer great fit i bought both the white and the purple love tla tees,1
2984,These leggings run true to size the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not seethrough like some leggings tend to be,1
2985,Love this top simple yet so stylish,1
2986,This is just the perfect sweater in my opinion i got it in the rose which is a gorgeous subtle color that will go with just about anything i love the knit pattern and the buttons and the sleeves are nice and long which is crucial for me at my height overall i just see myself throwing this on over everything so im sure i will treasure this for years to come,1
2987,This is a very pretty blouse the fabric is lightweight and very soft i read the other reviews and this does run very small i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely,1
2988,Soft very forgiving and flattering top wish it was not so pricey,1
2989,Love this so much because its so soft pliable and fits wonderfully with all of my fall wardrobe i ordered the plum color which looks brown to me was advised to size up and glad i did i bought large petite and my stats are,1
2990,I really loved the idea of this dress and thought it may be perfect for work with a pair of wedges but the first thing that set me off was the color and the material the color is more street sign yellow than a soft warm yellow the fabric is a thin sheet like fabric that makes the yellow look even cheaper i was anticipating a thicker shirtlike fabric when i tried it on i liked the idea but the material and the color made me feel like i was wearing costumeor a parachute i will defin,0
2991,I bought this top thinking i would wear this and feel like i was part of some fashion week but its cut way too large that i felt like a football player this top is made for women with small shoulders and a super petite frame also the cut is way too big i was swimming in this,0
2992,This is way shinier in person than i expected but i like it there are gold threads throughout which stand out i love shiny things so i was pleasantly surprised i agree that you could size down if you wanted but it looks cute roomy and loose i think really soft i will wear this to the park or dressed up for dinner love the double duty aspect im a little bummed about the fabric content but thats it,1
2993,I ordered different styles of jogger pants and these were definitely the ones to keep true to size and instantly comfortable due to the soft material they are made from the taupe color i got will go with a lot too these are great pants that you wont be sorry you bought,1
2994,Unfortunately this dress did not work for me like the other reviews i am lbs and the dress looked like a tent on me size s there was just way too much material at the bottom also while the dress is lined both layers are quite thin not see through but i would not call them substantial either for the cost of the dress and the material it wasnt worth paying more to have it tailored to fit better,0
2995,Beautiful blouse the material is great long enough to wear over leggings but ive also worn with my flare jeans somewhat fitted at the top and then drapes out in a gorgeous way one of my new favorites,1
2996,I was really looking forward to these tees working after reading the reviews unfortunately they had slits on the sides that came up higher than i was comfortable showing my sides just above my jeans trying to keep it age appropriate,0
2997,This will be my goto shirt for fall its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleevethe neckline is unique the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest fit is slim nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering i will likely purchase more colors once on sale i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected my only drawback is how thin the material is i can see it getting snags or holes easily but i will deal,1
2998,This is not only comfortable but incredibly flattering being its also long enough for me,1
2999,I love this shimmer tankin both colors it is a very thin fabricthinner than i would have expected but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank i think you can never go wrong with sparkles especially in a layering tankit dresses up or fancies up the outfit the straps on this tank are not adjustable and if you are large chested i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh,1
3000,This is the perfect top it is adorable and the fit and cut of it is forgiving,1
3001,I purchased this in both the black and the turquoise and wish they made more colors this top is perfect for our florida degree weather i am usually a medium in tops size broad shoulders size c and i purchased this in a p and a as they were out of petite in turquoise i do prefer the p as i am i would say this runs generous as there is ample room to move i wear mine with a nude bra on the turquoise top and the bra straps show a bit but they are almost covered by the s,1
3002,I am petite even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace it made it look cheap i wanted this to be the perfect lbd i just couldnt make it work on my body,0
3003,Saw this hanging in the store it is cute front and back it is flattering as well i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night looks amazing with a denim jacket,1
3004,I know i will be wearing this a lot i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened i wore it on sat and sun for long walks great piece,1
3005,I just got this in xss at my store and i love it i have a petite frame lbs so its much longer on me than on the models and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than whats shown in retailers pics so that may vary a bit however the back of mine looks exactly like whats shown above i love the drape and the way it falls on me super casualchic in my opinion id say the color is deep teal wish it wasnt hand wash but sometimes thats worth it,1
3006,I returned this dress because the material is so flimsy and thin i was expecting higher quality especially for the price i was disappointed it is a pretty dress and fit great but i felt like i was wearing tissue paper,0
3007,I love everything about this tee it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees the fabric is soft and the tee is very comfortable i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors i actually love both colors the red is a nice slightly brownish red i wore that color with a pair of plaid white teal taupe shorts and i got compliments on my outfit the color will go with more than one might think i havent worn the green one yet i hope this tee comes bac,1
3008,This dress looks lovely on the model but it looks just awful on mei am and curvy the shoulders are cut w a weird shape instead of a cap sleeve it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders it looks like i am ready to get beamed into spacethe material is nice and the sequins are pretty but the cut of the dress is unflattering,0
3009,I have a short torso and this works well for me c bought the theres not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesnt hang and have extra fabric like on the model zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so its easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabricunlike another reviewer i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer wi,1
3010,Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave it just misses the mark and will be going back,0
3011,This jacket is perfect the crop length is just right not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame im a a typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust dd this jacket is loose fitting and roomy i could probably have gone with a large but im really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and its just super roomy and comfy the quality of this jacket is great it will be a staple for years to come i,1
3012,This dress is extremely comfortable and looks great on im and dd and the m petite fit like a dream with even a bit of room at the bust the length is perfect with sandals or even up to inch heels perfect for travel and summer entertaining,1
3013,I ordered this in my usual size small b bust around lbs but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didnt cinch in at the waist at all rather bubbled out a bit the tunic flaps laid strangely as well like they were too small almost the high cut sides were indeed high cutshowing the waistband of my leggings apparently that is a new style as i have seen a few other tops like it around but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on,0
3014,Unique and wellmade skirt sure to turn heads embroidery is lovely def a statement piece for any wardrobe,1
3015,Even in my usual petite small size this looked bulky and made me look stumpy disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality i dont even know if going down a size would have helped as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe,0
3016,Pilcros always fit perfectly and these jeans are no different the style is great and a little different with the slits on the side i bought the gold color which is a little brighter than pictured for that reason im on the fence about keeping them i wish there were other bold colors to choose from since most of the other choices seem washed out,1
3017,One of the most beautiful sweaters ive ever seen i love it,1
3018,This vest is great im wearing with my red striped turtleneck dress i got on sale here i can see this going with so many outfits mainly those dresses that might feel a little tight around butt and hip area this will cover it all worth full price imo tts im a and this in m is perfect,1
3019,I bought one of these tees for myself and one as a gift both in green which is really a beautiful dark teal color as pictured the fabric is so soft that the gift recipient said she wanted an entire jumpsuit made of this fabric the shirt is long enough loose enough and substantial enough to wear untucked as pictured but lightweight enough to tuck in to a pencil skirt i am usually an xs or an s in tops and i ordered the s in this one the larger size gives the slightly loose fit,1
3020,I love ag stevie cords im and pearshaped and the p fit great the length and midrise are perfect very comfortable and can be dressed up for casual work environment or down for weekend the material is a bit thinner and not as soft as versions from previous years but still very nice and perhaps more versatile wish petite had more color options,1
3021,I bought this duster in the blue color and really like it i am so love the longer length the large was too wide so got the medium the sleeves were a little snug on my upper arms but after wearing it for awhile they loosened up i think i will get the white too,1
3022,I wore these pants for the first time yesterday to two parties before anyone asked for my name they complimented me on the pants my husband loved it my friends loved it and people i didnt know loved it its worth every penny i paid for it i bought these pant to bring on my trip to italy later this summer,1
3023,This dress is way prettier in person than online fits like a glove a little tight up top as are most side zips i did not have to size up however,1
3024,I ordered the floral blue dress i am a size and ordered the medium it did not find that it was large on top as others had mention i love the smoking but would also look great with a belt and boots it makes a great all weather dress,1
3025,I have a closet full of dresses and very few have the quality and attention to detail as this gorgeous dressoften times when ordering online the dress that you actually receive will have a different fabric placement than the online photosand it can detract from the overall lookbut the one that i received is exactly as pictured the gold details hit in all the right placesthe quality is shocking looks like a dresstrue to size however the chestbust runs a little big,1
3026,Very comfortable and looks really good on me thats very important,1
3027,This shirt is very soft and fits nicely as with a lot of maeve tops the arms are a little snug so if you have muscular arms youll definitely want to size up it wont make the shirt too blousey because it will still look really cute tucked in in the front with ankle jeans and a trendy belt i wish i had gotten this in the blue before it sold out because it is lovely,1
3028,Im lbs c and the xs fit perfectly very soft feminine top i got many compliments the first day i wore it wire it for business casual but looking forward to wearing it with flare jeans for a more s look highly recommend this great sale on a wonderful top,1
3029,I am b small waist wide hips dress fits perfectly a little longer than i had expected hits about midcalf on me great quality corduroy nice medium green color very unique sort of vintage feel piece,1
3030,I bought this online because i love the print on the dress and i was not disappointed it is gorgeous the waist on the dress is much looser than in the picture but i am fine with that i am and the dress length is accurate as shown in the picture,1
3031,I was so excited to get this dressi even paid expedited shipping i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed it was just too big im a size petite and the size was overwhelming the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just cant wear the dress not sure what to do but buyers be careful pretty color and design but not welldesigned,0
3032,I love boiled wool paired with classic silhouettes and this bonette combines best of both the fabric is soft not too substantial but still warm for my climate goes great with many outfit combinations has a flexible cut for my body type i chose to to buy the size small and while its a little tight in the upper sleeves because my upper arms are chubby i can work with it when i wear the right top the medium was a just a bit too boxy for the profile i wanted but i may get it any way in the,1
3033,I love this top the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely both front and back its also very comfortable and soft allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft teeshirt the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up sadly its sold out in in my size online and in the stores otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price,1
3034,So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute it looked a million times cuter in the photos,0
3035,Was not expecting to like this tried on and super cute comfy relaxed fit looked good with leggings i had on but color will be great with jeans too will wear both unzipped and zipped,1
3036,These looked really interesting online and with the multicolor stripes i thought it would pair nicely with many tops the fabric is nice and sturdy the colors are more vibrant than online the design however is terrible when i put them on i double checked to make sure they werent on backwards the back is flat as a board but the front has these poofy pockets the poor fit with the bright stripes gives a s circus diaper look which is not good theyre also really tight compar,0
3037,These are great pants i was nervous because when i saw them at the store they looked pretty linty but after wearing them a number of times they are not bad i have to run a lint roller over them occasionally but not more than other black pants i wear these to work and they are very comfortable kind of stretchy but very flattering the higher rise than the other stevies makes them work really well for workallows them to look less jean like i highly recommend thesecant believe they aren,1
3038,Ordered a size my usual at retailer very flattering fits well,1
3039,This dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i cant wait to wear it size small worked for me and since im tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail,1
3040,I love this skirt i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style i originally ordered a small but returned and exchanged for a medium which fits great i typically wear a size in pants i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall,1
3041,I really liked the casual style of this top but i was disappointed when i put it on its cut weird the shoulder cutouts are smaller than pictured and just dont seem to hang right they dont hit where theyre supposed to and the sleeves were also not as pictured more like which i didnt like the color is really nice and i liked the fabric but the fit was just off i tried xs and s both fit weird,0
3042,The dress is really frumpy standing up something about the bottom tier of lace just turns it into a frumpy mawmaw nightgown the lace is really pretty though,0
3043,Runs large in arm holes have to wear bandeau love this print and flow of dress loose but still flattering due to arms and shoulders love the overall look midi length for this gal size s worked best clbs,1
3044,This sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece i think it can be easily dressed up and down the quality is quite nice and should hold up over timethe sizing of this really depends on the desired fit i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts but honestly i tried the medium as well and it was much different just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired for reference,1
3045,I bought this skirt in the store a few months ago because i anticipated that retailer would sell out of my size considering how great the fitlook of this skirt is sure enough theyve sold out of the size normally i wear a size sometimes in skirts depending on the cut and where its from just last year i bought a skirt from retailer in a size for me this was a skirt i needed to try on to get the perfect size but its absolutely adorable and a great deal at the sale price its mod,1
3046,For my c bust hourglass frame and lbs i got the medium and found it fit well a bit snug but i didnt want to go to large and have it too loose at the top my thoughts belowpros lots of stretch and comfortable due to being part modal the pleating on either side on the shoulders just drapes so lovely with the cowlneck it just gives it an edgy look that i really like this grey has actually a minuscule houndstoothlike or checkboardlike appearance thats ha,1
3047,The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice they are a very rich green and pink which were a popular color combination in the s i was there it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair i am pounds and usually wear a size six in a dress the small fit perfect while the dress is billowy the square on the back pulls it in so it doesnt fit like a tent perfect for boots now sandals lat,1
3048,Love the quality of this material and how the lines fall on the back i got a a medium petite because the small was sold out and i like how it fits petite sits around the hip area and its not too long which i like the color is definitely more of an orangetangerine color not red great cover up sweater,1
3049,I was on the fence about this cardigan once i got it in the mail its cute it will go great with a long tank or longer tshirt worth the sale price i ordered a small and is true to size,1
3050,I agree with other reviewers it is beautiful but too tight around the chest i am usually an xsmall and the xsmall was tight in the chest i bought the small and it was still uncomfortable sadly i had to return it i am lbs and a c by no means i am considered big chested so this is highly unusual,0
3051,I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both the fabric is very soft ive worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work very versatile,1
3052,This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile great for dressing up or down i am large busted g so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover i am petite with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great,1
3053,Im very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews this skirt is more amazing in person at first the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person but as usual moulinette knows how to put things together when worn everything comes together the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way the skirt runs large im b waist h,1
3054,I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design not too fancy but definitely not casual either easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions the fit is great but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly it truly is fine though has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel very comfortable for an evening out,1
3055,So soft high quality perfect poncho sweater that will go with every pair of jeans you have love,1
3056,I love everything about this dress cute comfortable easy to wear it does wrinkle a little and its not lined but otherwise i love it,1
3057,Love it so pretty got tons of compliments the white color makes you look tan but the red still gives it color comfy not body hugging though if youre looking for that,1
3058,Super comfortable and on trend with the embroidery and beading wore it day after i received to the airport over tee shirt jeans and got compliments left and right love it,1
3059,I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small although i ordered both to see the smaller size fit better around the shoulders it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time great price for such a quality piece,1
3060,Great sweater for casual days just the right length and fabric weight very versatile fit is true to size not oversized,1
3061,Was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress i have already a few events lining up for the summer months and i could see this working on those hot summer days im short and curvy so i tried on the large in store im busty and ended up ordering the petite l online the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room i love the length i feel a great length when youre only will look great wi,1
3062,I love this dress i bought it weeks ago and have already worn it times each time receiving multiple compliments it is easy comfortable and cute also love that you can tie it in the back or the front great dress,1
3063,This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight so definitely appropriate for winter fall and cooler spring days i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot it was wider down the torso and a little shorter not tunic length like picture im with a longer torso and this hit maybe midbum and,1
3064,I love the way this dress moves on you and the high low a medium fit me perfectly i am and the long part in the back barely touches the floor in flat shoes the colors are sort of fall but the top is like a sun dress i think you could wear this any time of year with the appropriate accessories i wore it with a length sleeved cardigan and sandals in oct and it was perfect the fabric feels nice great quality its on sale so you have nothing to loose,1
3065,Its such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternityish so i returned it,0
3066,This dress is incredibly soft comfortable and essentially lined i mean look at all that intricate embroidery your skin has no idea it is there the colors are lovely the embroidery is sort of a soft peachy cream lined with gold and the dress is even prettier in person the neckline is low but not too revealing and though i normally avoid shirts without sleeves the cut is flattering around my arms the cut of the hem is also flattering in some ways the belt seems like an extra pie,1
3067,These felt like they were cutting off circulation around the calves i tried pulling them lower to reduce the tightness but that made them way too droopy between the legs an alternative would be to clip the elastic but ultimately decided to return,0
3068,Adorable jacket i ordered the medium lbs sleeves are long and have to roll them up ordering the petite medium to see if it fits better pink color is great,1
3069,I really wanted to like this because the color is beautiful and the knit is obviously good quality but the shape is impossible to work with it doesnt just run big it just hangs there really disappointing itll have to go back,0
3070,I just purchased these jeans online in my regular size bs and they fit me just perfect so they are tts they are super soft and theres just enough stretch in these that im able to bend easily yet they retain their shape nicely the pockets in the front are super cute in person and the back gives a really cute look the color is just as shown in the picture a nice shade of blue thats in the middle plus they are really incredibly soft im only but found the regular,1
3071,I absolutely love these pants i got the yellow and it is a beautiful soft color the fabric is soft and flowing i am lb and the petite fit perfectly some stated they are too long even in petite but i disagree the patch pockets are darling dont hesitate to try these pants out,1
3072,This dress was too cute to pass up i loved it online but when i got it home it was so tight i couldnt zip up my normal size the length was perfect on me being the fabric and detail was beautiful if you have a bust order a size up beautiful dress just really snug up top,0
3073,I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made the color palette is an added bonus i knew for my height to size up because it looked short i tried on the felt it was still to short i would have to wear a or to get the length i would like i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter i am a d,1
3074,Must have i splurged on the white style and red style couldnt choose between the two shape of shirt worked for me the white style isnt too thin that you have to wear something underneath costly for the quality of fabric but i had a gift card and it is retailer after all,1
3075,I bought these on sale for a great price online without seeing in person and was pleased to find that they are very versatile could be very casual or great for weekend shopping etc the purple is a great shade and the fit is great im pound for reference and i purchased the size,1
3076,I dont usually pay fullprice for retailer clothes but i had a off coupon and i decided to give this dress a try as it irradiated a happy vibe and reminded me of books and dressup clothes from my childhood i dont regret it one bit the colors and the print are absolutely beautiful and i love how they mix up and contrast in a subtle way i really like the long sleeves with the elastic at the wrist the cord at the waist hangs with a fun mix of tiny beads faux mini crab claws and faux mi,1

3082,This is very cute i got a lot of compliments when i wore it im so i always struggle with tops being too short but this was ok,1
3083,I really wanted to love the shorts when i read that the shorts were lined i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didnt show even though the shorts are lined you can see through the fabric completely this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design pockets and comfortable waistline im returning the shorts as well,0
3084,Ive been wearing these shorts for years i work outside and it was great to have comfortable jean shorts that were just the perfect length the fabric quality on these shorts and many many other retailer items has gone down sure theyre great when you try them on in the storesoft comfortable flattering but when these are worn for a day they get so stretched out that i feel like i need a belt to keep them on i wore these several times sat down on a relatively smooth concrete wall and a,0
3085,I really like this dress i tried it on in the store and i had to take it home with me the print is fun and bright and interesting without being over the top the grommets give it a little bit of edgy balance to the sweet flowy shapea note on the the fit i am a and the fit well it is a bit loose in some places like the waist but it certainly doesnt look like a maternity dress i think the looseness is a good part of the overall look i am highwaisted and the waistline hit,1
3086,A nice rayon peasant shirt like the sleeve length good for a fuller figure covers all the bad sports and very comfortable,1
3087,I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse not flattering at all i loved the concept silky loose fitting professional but they didnt succeed its a big mess return,0

3091,This is a great addition its comfortable pretty and can be dressed up and down most importantly its slenderizing and a great length for me i bought it in my regular size but bought the petite size noting the model is and where the dress stopped on her im the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me it also comes with a lovely blue slip such great quality for the price,1
3092,I got this in the color listed as pink its not a usual pink the fit is goodnot too tight and not too loose the length is good for a tee,1
3093,This top comes in lovely colors too bad only one of htem looks decent on my skin tone purple though i might have gotten away with the silvery greyfit nice falttering line flares at the bottom and is loose aroun d the waist so if you ahve a problem area nice coveragefeel super soft nuff said versatility i am not sure it will look great with everything on my body type but definitly a nice pair of jeans flare or skinny with bootsa and may try the pencil skirt look like the,1
3094,The minute i put this sweater on i couldnt wait to take it off it was way too scratchy for me so for those with any type of sensitivity to wool this is not the sweater for you otherwise i thought the design was quite cute,0
3095,Love it the light blue is a gorgeous color i thought this might be more chambray but im happy its not its also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape,1
3096,This product looks great on the model but for anyone with a normal body type the band in the center is way too tight im a a and wear a pants and it was huge in the bust and too small in the waist and hips the violet one looks much more blue in the photograph it is truly lavender and purple i really wanted to love this swimsuit but instead i had to return it pay for return shipping and i am out about now very disappointed,0

3101,I love these pants they are very soft but the linen is thick and highquality,1
3102,As soon as you get up close to this sweater you will notice that the bird on the front is of an interesting kind of materialalmost like carpet that has been shaved waaaaaaaay down so that the little fibers are sticking straight up and a fraction of a millimeter high i was not excited about this texture and can imagine it will be a huge magnet for collecting lint and dust throughout the day the fit was way off on this one for me and was not flattering at all it wasnt for me at all even thou,0
3103,Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined and fits a nice sized phone the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i,1
3104,I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips but for those of us with curves im a size hourglass these are very unflattering they made me look like i was carrying an extra pounds just around the hips so bummed because they look so cute on the model,0
3105,When i spotted this online i just knew it was a must have holding horses brand usually runs big on me but this is a more fitted top i ordered the size so i cld compare well the is a little snug in the bust area the bodice seam falls high across the midbust area except for that the fit is good being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i dont think the works for me the size is much looser overall the fit is much better in the bust area the armh,1
3106,This black dress with raised white embroidery is lovely and flattering the fabric has a nice texture and is mediumweight cotton and machine washable the dress is unlined its a bit hard to get on and take off even though the buttons can be undone which helps there is a tie at the waist drawstringstyle i only wish my store had the petite size as i am wondering whether the xs that fit me in the store will still fit as an xs p,1

3113,This dress is quite the stunner i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem four stars in quality though as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition as opposed to rayon viscose only still a versatile dress for day or night i love the length of the petite size please note im the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees a keeper,1
3114,I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer i was drawn to the color and the swing first of all this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight i love the flow of the loose peplum the straps are nicely placed because theyre wider and accentuate my arms and cover my bra straps i love the little v neck detail it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over but the top stays conservative when truly upright i wore this shirt days in a row last week and,1
3115,I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size beware i have a d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the s it was a thick polyester type material i think this shirt would still work f,0

3122,This is a gorgeous dress but i did title my review worth the trouble because of the buttons which a few other people mentioned i ordered this from the website and when i tried it on at home a button snapped right in half my mother put on all new buttons that were stronger but look exactly the same of course i shouldnt have to do that to be able to wear the dress but i love eyelet and was willing the new buttons cost about so not a big deal in the end i agree with another revi,1

3129,This is the perfect pencil skirt the pattern is flawlessthe top shown with it here online is outrageously expensive i paired it with a lace turquoise top that retailer has in stores and you can also wear it with a wine colored top i would not wear it with black because you just lose the stunning colorsif you love fall colors this skirt is perfect,1

3133,I love this tee i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors the vneck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch i like the doublev neck in the back as well as front it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way overall the length and cut are just ideal,1
3134,Love this top it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch it is light weight and not too long or wide i have other tla tops in small but the xsm worked better for me with this top,1

3140,I bought this is a size small im and the fit it perfect it is a very pretty red and looks very cute on im very happy i bought it but i did buy it on sale otherwise i may have hesitated because of the price,1
3141,Love this top for spring great with athletic leggings regular leggings or jeans it is a lot longer in the back which i like as it covers my butt and makes leggings workappropriate great quality true to size i am and lbs xs fits perfectly fabric is a little wrinkly but that is intentional lighter material so it is good for spring weather but sturdy enough not to be see through at all,1
3142,This top is well made and fits me like a glove i am only but have a very muscular build the xs fits perfectlyslimming around the torso but roomy enough in the shoulders and arms the fabric is a nice upgrade from typical flannel,1
3143,This sweater is beautifulthe lace is gorgeous and the sweater is soft and cozyrare to find a top that is stunning and comfortable at the same timethe lace is very high quality and enhances the sweater in a very sophisticated wayadding that little something specialthe color keeps the overall look elegant and appropriate for any ageruns true to size,1

3145,These are super comfy and so flattering i feel like the picture doesnt do them any justice they would also look cute paired with wedges,1
3146,Im usually a maeve fan i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly it is also very thin material and showed everything,0
3147,Really wanted to love the top was very flattering and loved the material very swingy and forgiving but way to much material i was drowning in it sized down to x small but no go,0
3148,Dress is awesome and makes you look skinnier,1
3149,I love everything about this dress beautiful vibrant color and fabric i got the sp which is a perfect length for me to wear with the jasper jeera nijar sandles it is very flowy and full but i love that about it happy i was able to snag a petite size but i think the regular would have been ok i could have gotten away with an xs but the small fits great,1
3150,This sweater is so soft and comfortable looks dressy with skirt and booties or casual with leggings and flats,1
3151,I dont know why i didnt pay much attention to this tee the yellow but i didnt i saw it in the store thought it was interesting and kept on going then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it and no surprise it was sold out at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size although im small i have several tla tees in medium so i tried on a medium and a small as,1
3152,I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it i found the fit to be true to size i am pounds and i bought the xs which is my usual size in retailer jackets i love the material and the way it hangs so casually,1
3153,I purchased the tealblue and the color is striking though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy for a looser fit you may want to size up for a more fitted look it is true to size,1
3154,I ordered the white denim online and was very disappointed by how thin the material was i had tried on the light blue denim in the store and it had a nice weight to it the style is wonderful and the fit is very flattering but too sheer for me to wear outside the house,0
3155,Yes this dress is so lovely i wear a size a size in this was perfect under slip over a delicate overlay heading to italy and this will be so perfect drape is so flattering colors are feminine cut is lovely effortlessly elegant and reads much more expensive dont hesitate a special one,1
3156,Walked into the store and the first thing that caught my eye was this dress great pattern and fabric a quality versatile piece i am a size and purchased an xs petite seems to run just a tad big,1
3157,I love this top the colors are beautiful look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet its the perfect betweenseason itemsince i dont like garments that have a boxy fit i was concerned that this top wouldnt work for me after reading some of the other reviews but it looks great feels comfy,1
3158,Purchased this item on salereceived it and it had two huge holes on the sidenot possible to repair very disappointed in lack of quality control,0
3159,And not in a good way everywhere i went i left a little of this sweater behind within hours of having it on i was picking balls of fabric off the couch bed and the sweater itself looked like it was molting great style fabric and fit although a little on the long side but theres no way i can keep it,0
3160,I loved these pants the fit well and were flattering unfortunately after three wears they came apart at the seam very disappointing and frustrating,0
3161,I bought this in red in xs lbs its really cute and flirty but not in a little girl way which some ruffle tops can look the material is nice a little over priced but isnt everything from retailer the red is a perfect red imo its got an orangey undertone to it looks so good with white jeans and black sandals if youre inbetween sizes i would size down but otherwise pretty true to size i wear everything in xs from retailer and the xs fits perfect,1
3162,These pants are beautiful and so comfortable the liner is a nice surprise they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket im so pleased to have gotten them on sale,1
3163,I bought this in a large im normally an xl it is a very large on the bottom i really like that style so the extra fabric was good i tried on the white and orange the white is sheer and i didnt like the fabric as much the orange way really cute though,1
3164,The movement in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some yeah i can wear these attitude not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is thick enough to hide flaws i am lbs and i ordered the petite i am usually a petite the size p fits perfectly i ordered the apricot color great neutral im so happy i was able to get a pair theres a reason most sizes are sold out i have short legs and my legs are medium in size i worried about the thigh,1
3165,Tried this on to see if the size works in regular size and i love the fir it si very feminine and flattering i will have to go back for it both apttenrs are really nice and it also comes in balck in my storeneckline is super flattering,1
3166,Great jacket love that the hoodie insert is removable so i can wear just the outer jacket for work,1
3167,Got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work more personality than a plain tshirt but still comfortable got lots of compliments,1
3168,The length is perfect the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute i love it w ghillie type flats or booties pair w a big warm sweater or a sleek turtleneck and watch heads turn as you enter the room i promise love this skirt,1
3169,Great cut super flattering it does run a little big in my opinion though im usually a mediumsize and i had to get a small,1
3170,I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture but i had wishful thinking i should have gone with my gut this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases it is seethrough and flimsy the bottom is just like the picture it hangs in an odd rumpled way the top is very flattering though so its a shame if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu,0
3171,This is more of an undershirt than a shirt the material is very very thin and it shows everything it was beyond unflattering on me dont buy this unless you have a knockout thin body,0
3172,I love this summery blouse it sits at high hip so no tucking in the sleeves are fluttery and flattering to the arm i own this same pattern in a knit and like it so much i got the woven when i saw it the only downsides are that it has to be ironed and it the sleeves are too big to layer under a sweater,1
3173,This is one of my favorite tanks i have ever worn the swing style means you can wear it with any pants and the straps are wide enough to accommodate a serious bra i usually wear an lxl but am wearing a m in these so definitely size down at least once you will love this,1
3174,Bought this is black and white love them but washed the white by hand and it shrunk,1
3175,I love all the pilcro chinos they fit great and the material is so soft they also wash very well,1
3176,I really wanted to love this dress but i couldnt it ran large and heavy rather than a sleek cocktail dress it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on there was one upside the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture,0
3177,I purchased this dress in our retailer store i usually wear either a or petite lbs i was able to wear a r in this and it fit perfectly i paired it with a sparkly belt from retailer for a cocktail party and received lots of compliments,1
3178,Great shirt i am a tshirt wearing girl so i like to have a lot of different styles this is more than a tshirt great style and thicker than expected great fit overall love it,1
3179,I purchased this dress in my regular size small as soon as i saw it pop up online and found it to be tts d it hits just to my knee im and it actually reminds me of the way maeves devery dress looks and fits which is really really nice im finding this dress by floreat to also be quite slimming and the embroidery and colors set against the black is just absolutely gorgeous the material is super soft the vneck isnt too low and i love the pockets so im very happy with my,1
3180,Was looking for a top with this style i ordered this top wondering if it would fit in the hip area after reading the size chart it showed a close fit the answer is yes theres room to spare which is a good thing i like the nubby front material and the hemlines asymmetrical style ill be layering this top with sweaters and jackets all winter very soft feeling fabric wouldnt mind another one in a different color,1
3181,Really cute top the material is soft and feels like great quality love the loose cut and slight detail to the simple shirt,1
3182,Top is very cute and wearable fit is boxy but nice,1
3183,This sweater is very cute i got a medium im broad in the shoulders and a c i wanted it a little loose threw it over a tshirt and was not itchy at all i feel it is light weight and perfect for our mild winters in florida cant wait till the weather cools down to wear it,1
3184,This blouse has a very cute style the ruffles are really nice but why does it have to be so sheer there is no way i could wear this to work without a cami it also felt slightly on the small size almost too tight for my normal size,0
3185,The fit on this shirt is bizarreit very much resembles a nursing top but wouldnt actually work for that purpose the side visible in the picture is nicely draped but the other side can flap open and is completely different i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate,0
3186,I just bought this jacket for my mom to take with her on a trip to europe it is perfect perfect packing piece that doesnt wrinkle and is a substantial enough weight to wear on chilly evenings considering buying an additional one in my size,1
3187,I bought this dress for a cruise im going on in january its so light and comfortable im and the length is perfect it will look really cute with a jean jacket and some booties great price for this dress you cant pass this up,1
3188,Fun top lbs and i ordered xs it was too wide and boxy so exchanged for xxs and it fits great i like the fun slant to the side not tight on stomach which is great great top,1
3189,I really wanted to like these but they just didnt look right on my sorta bulky frame i have big thighs and always feel out of place wearing leggings so maybe im just not the right target for these but they looked so cute and i wanted to give them a try the waist was too high for my liking and the leg openings were too big and gave me a stumpified look,0
3190,Perfect denim top the fabricmaterial is great and of good quality there is a structure to the top but it really makes the looks the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways for the quality a definite must buy,1
3191,This top is light and airy but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit it runs slightly big but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special,1
3192,I just loved this online and love it in person so feminine and delicate just perfect for summer get togethers,1
3193,Fabulous dress for both quality and design the embroidery is gorgeous and the long sleeves make it practical to begin wearing immediately true to size and flattering looks darling with booties,1
3194,I love this top i wear it all the time the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade id still recommend it as it is so comfortable,1
3195,There were only pairs left in my store and they had my size they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color i would definitely recommend i may buy the floral embroidery ones too,1
3196,This sweater is a hit the color is fantastic and the shoulder cutouts add a feminine and unique touch looks amazing paired with booties a statement necklace and jeans definitely affordable too highly recommend,1
3197,So i ordered both sizes in this small and xs im lbs and and the xs fit me at first i wasnt sure about this piece but after getting it on it starts to grow on you the top part of the jumper fits really cute and the bottoms are very wide and can be long i did get this at a great price so im going to keep it dont know how many times i will end up wearing but thought it would be really cute to wear out on date night with my husband,1
3198,I couldnt decide whether to get it in the black and white stripe or the blue so i bought both these tshirts are incrediblesoft comfortable fit well im usually a size in retailer clothing xs fit true to size for this shirt the blue is vibrant and as another reviewer noted theres a tiny black stripe in between the blue and white the black and white is actually more of a creamoffwhite but still pleasing and versatile sleeves roll up easily which is a preference of mine they,1
3199,I love rifle paper and when i saw this dress online i knew that i had to have it this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture its pretty and delicate and can easily be dressed up or down i found this dress to fit true to size it definitely has that baby doll dress fit to it but i love it this is a dress that ill feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again,1
3200,Ive worn citizens for almost years now i keep going back because i have an athletic figure my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation these did not meet any of those standards the ripped as soon as i put them on the material seemed cheap,0
3201,I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money look at the top the stripe colors are different and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well and the dress was short on me and im two inches shorter than the model bummer,0
3202,Purchased dress in blue motif love it it is casual and comfortable no fuss dress love the sexy open scoop back that is just high enough to comfortably cover my bra strap,1
3203,I have been hunting for a pair of high rise flares that have significant width at the bottom and these are perfect i love the vintage silhouette and how they make your legs look a mile long and i adore how they open wide enough to cover my shoes not to mention being long enough for me to wear a heel and still skim the ground for reference im lbs with super long legs and straight athletic build i sized up to a which is usually for me in ag jeans so for the brand they run tts,1
3204,This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures it is short and very wide i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid,0
3205,I love this little topper it is very comfortable it looks elegant,1
3206,I received this as a gift for my birthday in the navy blue and it fits great im and the petite medium was the perfect length,1
3207,I love it perfect body hugging just right length and great fabric colors this shift fits just above knee and follows every curve it is however unforgivingthere is no room in this to cover bumps or bulges it is sleek and so figureflattering i am lbs tall and d and it fits perfectly one more pound and it wouldnt have zipped i got a size my usualbut too tight had to size up to if you are on the fence go up a size i cant however imagine wearing this sleeveless a,1
3208,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately its going back because the knit is just too thin i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but its not and because its so light the swing effect doesnt really come off nothing special,0
3209,Lots of stretch in fabric so pants fit well length is perfect for me im almost ft in and they hit at bottom of ankles with slightly extra fabric so flats heels or boots work great with these pants i bought size and im lbscolors in pants are beautiful many different colored tops go well with them,1
3210,This brand makes the best jackets i got a vest from them last year and an olive moto jacket both fit amazing this one is no different it fits great love that its a great casual jacket with structure and drape i cant say enough good things about this jacket every time i wear it i feel so pulled together fun light gray color that you dont see too often in jackets this is a jacket i see in my wardrobe for years to come must have,1
3211,I love everything about this dress the style fit colors and design of fabric quality and feel of fabric so happy and highly recommend,1
3212,This sweater caught my eye months ago and i recently picked it up on sale at a great price it reminds me of something betty draper would wear on mad men it has a fabulous s feel to it and everyone loves pockets i love the combination of peachy pink and cream and the sweater it quite warm the fit is good although on me the buttons gap slightly this is easily remedied by wearing a shirt underneath as shown on the model im already dreaming up lots of fun outfit combinations,1
3213,Highly recommend these jeans they are ultrasoft and fit your body like a dream the wash is flattering on them as well i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size,1
3214,This is a review of customer service in generalfrom several issues with online shopping i dont understand why you ask for my opinion and say it counts when clearly it does noti have had a lot of issues receiving parcels from one of your carrierslaser ship and i have reported the issues to them and retailerbut it appears only the good parts are readthis poor service cost me money in postage and lost discounts but again im ignoredand i had to order my last returned parcel again pay more fo,1
3215,I love this caftan it can be worn belted as a dressier look or unbelted down to the pool or beach as more of a caftan this is the perfect versatile piece to have for the summer,1
3216,Loved this sweater wrap and bought it in both colors very light weight and i will get lots of use out of this i wish retailer would have more pieces like this a,1
3217,The cut fabric and detail on this dress is incredible it runs a bit small though usually i wear a p but the p is plenty snug lbsc fits just as on the model looks much like photos but slightly more yellow in tone,1
3218,I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasnt a glitch the color is so off the picture shows a dark blue denim but they are not they are a light blue with whiskering retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading,0
3219,I purchased this jumpsuit in the store and i am so pleased with it i am usually a or top and the large was good the med was too tight on my bust love the print very feminine without looking like pjs cream background is beautiful fabric is light and cool and i love the pockets i was hesitant about the short length but i like it this is a special piece its hard to find jumpsuits like this,1
3220,Beautifully designed to flatter a womens figure i love the fit and feel of this classic but modern cardigan,1
3221,I absolutely love this shirt i saw it in the retailer store and immediately knew i had to have it all they had in stock was a size and a size im usually a in buttonup shirts but i tried the anyway and found it to be quite generously sized i have a dd bust so buttonup shirts rarely fit me properly this one was big enough to be comfortable worn out or tucked in and was loosefitting without being sloppy when i discovered that it came in petite sizes i asked the so to order t,1
3222,I had such high hopes for this dress but unfortunately it misses the mark completely the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length for someone who is lbs the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolanders derelict campaign i think one must have a specific body type for this dress but regardless theyll have to keep their arms at their sides,0
3223,I love how you can wear this with a tshirt or blouse,1
3224,I bought this dress online and have to say the material is really soft has a great weight to it and i bought it in the red motif i just wore it to work this past week and received a ton of compliments on it i wore it with black nylons black heels and a cropped leather jacket it is so figure flattering and so comfortable to wear i typically range in size from an xs to a s and the s fit me the best im and lb it is truly a lovely dress,1
3225,Seems there was a design defect in this itemsleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt i have pretty thin arms so its hard to imagine this not happening on anyone too bad because its otherwise a very nice top,0
3226,Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one the color is advertised as grey but its actually more like a light mocha the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender i generally wear a size and m or l size tops depending on the designer i purchased the l in this case because thats all that was available at,1
3227,I am typically a small in dresses but i should have gone with the other reviewers and sized down it had no shape but hung like a paper sack the armholes fit perfectly though if i had sized down they may have been too tight i am lbi will return too bad because it is a pretty dress,0
3228,Im the length is fine except id probably hem if i used for yogapilates but i prefer cropped for those activities so these are just knock a round lounge pants for me they are thin but not in a cheap way i dont understand why theyre called french terry became thats not what i seefeel but they are sumptuous soft i like that the fold over waist part is stitched keeps its shape for size reference i got the black xxs im lbs athletic apple they fitlook great clin,1
3229,This dress is well made great fit perfect aline the bust was lower cut than shown in the picture but it fits well even with a large chest completely flattering and i would highly recommend,1
3230,You make classy stuff this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirtcolors cant tell from the picture but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed very fun and happy yet appropriate colors for fall and winter the cut is very flattering the scallop part is interesting though it is sown at one part of the skirt in the middle not sure why i ordered the p and that fit me like a glove in waist in hips lbslength on the petite was above the knee like show,1
3231,This is so close to perfect but theres a seam down the middle of the back and they didnt bother to match the polka dots you can see the mismatch in the second photo i was about to buy the jacket and totally in love when i turned and saw the error i hoped it was one bad match but nope on every one couldnt unsee didnt buy very disappointed,0
3232,I love this cardigan its fit however really depends a lot on an individuals height and build i am about lbs i have slim arms and am larger in the chest my typical size in retailer clothing is m having said that i found that in this top a s fit best it made a difference with how the pockets and lapels lay the pants you wear may affect the look when you snap it closed wearing leggings or slim pants ex pilcro cords gave a much more flattering look to my backside jeansnot so muc,1
3233,Very flattering i am petite but have large breasts so i expected this dress to look boxy on me but the flowy fabric falls perfectly on the body and shows just the right amount of shape the pattern is beautiful and perfect for the cooler seasons the dress is also very versatile it can be dressed up with heels and a jacket or down with flats and a denim vest or jacket i know im going to wear this dress over and over this fall and winter,1
3234,These pants are flattering yet comfortable i am thrilled that they are available in tall sizes because i am feet tall the inch inseam is perfect and for me prevents the problem of high water pants the zippered pockets are flattering yet useful the high rise waist is wonderful these pants are perfect for wear in a number of occasions they are great,1
3235,This was an impulse purchase for me a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring this one did the trick i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day the jumpsuit is l,1
3236,Love this maxi gorgeous print flowy and romantic in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest i sized up from my usual to an and it was perfect i am and it was floor length without tripping me up looks great on darker skin i am on the fair side winter skin and the beige color down the middle looked fleshtoned and washed me out a bit but with a tan this dress will be perfect,1
3237,This skirt is absolutely beautiful the design and organza are so feminine and i love the length it flows beautifully and it isnt stiff or anything but it does hold its shape well i ordered it through the store and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days i think it would be easy to snag the material so i will be really careful when im wearing it the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu,1
3238,I needed a summer party dress for a few casual special occasions this summer and this dress fit the bill perfectly fits tts lb sz and is really flattering it is quite open in the front but i was able to keep everything situated w the right bra purchased it on sale and am so pleased,1
3239,I love this dress i rarely pay full price at retailer and couldnt take the risk of loosing this waiting for a sale i tried on two different size and a and they all fit the same a little large in the bust and the straps a tad long on the s i typically can go between and at retailer and with this dress the was a better fit im b and i had room in the bust on the and the was loose in the bust i did t have any gaping issues others commented about id have given it sta,1
3240,I saw this dress and fell in love right away this is right up my alley super comfy perfect fit and love the stud detail cant wait to wear,1
3241,The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering returning asap,0
3242,Love love love this dress i was worried the velvet would look cheap but it absolutely does not i bought an xxsmall and it is a little tight in the chest but everything else fits perfectly i bought this in the slate color but am seriously considering buying the lighter color as well,1
3243,Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did i wasnt crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly crisp and clean is how i would describe it launders well fits great drape is perfect wear tucked in or out cant go wrong,1
3244,Very comfortable dress for fall and early winter love the material and great to throw on to run errands in over the weekend or could dress up with flats and sweater for work,1
3245,Loved this dress fit like a glove so flattering and perfect for a summerfall wedding material is substantial and dress is well made im large chest and curvy and a size fit perfectly longer than seen on the model for me but i actually love it being tealength a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it poof i removed it but looks good either way,1
3246,What a pleasant surprise hugs in all the right places and a nice substantial material,1
3247,So i really like the plaid designs by siyu i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting but they were so cute i had to find out im really glad i did the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy it has an elastic waist which is a plus because sometimes even if the legs fit the waist is too small or vice versa i am a large and very curvy on the bottom and these are perfect and flattering and the elastic waist is just right as on the,1
3248,I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it they had an extra large i usually wear a large and i thought it would perfect with some leggings i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldnt fit it past her chest either we flipped it inside out and couldnt find a zipper maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small its too bad it looked adorable and i was so excited to try,0
3249,I never ever buy anything full price when it comes to retailer shopping love their stuff but way over priced so i patiently watch and wait this dress though i couldnt do it i had to have it i think it is a fabulous addition to my summer collection and i look forward to wearing it in a few weeks to a july th get away get it while you can,1
3250,The sweater and skirt are so pretty theyre really soft and have such an easy comfortable look together really love this gorgeous outfiti am borderline smallmedium and kept the size small after trying both on,1
3251,I ordered the mango and the navy in size i am and lbs both arrived with the size label on them the mango fit perfectly perfect length on the legs and very flattering the navy on the other hand was an inch shorter and an inch narrower i kept doublechecking the packing slip and the label inside the shorts to see if they accidentally sent a p but no it was clearly a i brought that back to the store and ordered another navy hoping that pair was just mislabeled or,1
3252,I purchased this shirt in white and black the white is more ivoryisn and is a bit thinsee through the shirts can be worn with jeans or dressed up with a skirt i just wish it was a little more form fitting i do like the hint of stretch in the fabric very comfortable as well,0
3253,Im a lbs purchased smalli was going back and forth between xs and s i decided on small because it fit better in my arms didnt feel as tight the xs fit well in the torso area and didnt have as much fabric as the small the small also had a longer shirt tail if you dont have as much mass in the arms get the xs if you have some muscle or extra mass in the arms its better to go with the small,1
3254,Call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down i had no weird sagging bagging or poofiness and i love the macrame belt i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too i purchased the small petite my stats for fit reference tall dd waist hips wide rib cage size ml tops size sm,1
3255,Im giving these leggings stars although i did return them first off i do love pilcro jeans and leggings beware these are not jeans at all the tag says serif legging these are excellent leggings if thats what youre looking for i thought they were jeans and was willing to spend the money on them but not for leggings ill consider buying if they go on sale,1
3256,I was hesitant to buy these jeans online because citizens are generally not very forgiving being that they dont have much stretch they are always in the stack that i try on but havent bought a pair of citizens in several years these are totally different the have enough stretch to be sculpting without being uncomfortable while keeping the substantial feeling that comes with denim versus leggings i looooooove these jeans,1
3257,I love this dress i was apprehensive about it at first because of the light material and boxy style turns out the material is very flattering and it hangs very well the style isnt as boxy as it seems it still flatters the figure without showing all your imperfections and it doesnt fit like a tent i am and i ordered the petite its short enough to show off you legs but not too short for being less fitting i like the balance of the short length and it looks great with heeled boo,1
3258,Cute dress i say true to size but keep in mind it is loose and flowy and i purchased in my usual size medium and it fits perfectly its lined so there is no need for a slip very comfortable and cool i am and it is above knee i paired it with the gemline lariat turquoise necklace and have already received several compliments and my day is only overa great priced dress which holds true to retailers quality and uniqueness of items offered,1
3259,I love this top not sure if i would picked it up in the store i received it as a gift from my husband kudos to him as it was a great choice i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality,1
3260,I ordered this and hoped it would be a fun whimsical sweater for this winter instead its just strange it didnt fit well too short in the overall length in the sleeves the shades of the yarn were drab it also didnt seem made to last it looked like it would pillsnag in a short amount of time i returned it id love to see a style similar to this executed better in the future having a unique sleeve is a cute idea,0
3261,I love all jeans by mother they are well made fit great and look so cute with any type of shoes from heels to flat to boots these jeans are perfect to wear out or when paired with a blazer can be worn to work i love these and have them in almost every color,1
3262,Soft fabric and long flattering perfect for leggings,1
3263,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on it slips over your head and i needed my yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows ridiculously impractical why oh why didnt heather give it a hook and loop closure instead,0
3264,Fun fun fun love the polka dot but also the cut on this skirt is very flattering and retro it is perhaps a little yellower on the ivory side but neutral nonetheless te fit is very flattering p fit waist hops length lbs in waist i think i will have to keep this lovely item as i doubt it will make it to sale in my size,1
3265,This jacket is adorable it is very flattering and different can easily be dressed up for work or dressed down as shown note it is unlined and very light weight these are huge selling points for me as it makes the jacket seasonless love it,1
3266,After seeing this on anthtos facebook page i was so excited to order i ended up going to a store and trying on i couldnt believe it was the same shirts when i first saw it i thought this ran quite big and the shape was odd lots of material in the middle i am a mom of young kids and didnt want people to think was on the way,0
3267,I love the cut of this top it flares out nicely and is very stylish the blue is also soft on every skin tone even my super pale skin i like that it has some detail not just the plain chambraydenim color the xs was nice i didnt try petite or xxs just bought the xs in store you can adjust how tight the fit is by tying the top and loose is nice in this style the length was also good lbs dd chest,1
3268,This general sweatshirt is cute stylish and can be dressed up or down a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings,1
3269,This is such a pretty top and a great multiseason piece i love the colors and pattern and the cut is flattering its not too low cut in the front which is nice it is woven on the frontsleeves and knit in the back so im a little nervous about how it will wash i usually wear a m in retailer tops and a l in tiny they usually are truly tiny but in this tiny a m was good,1
3270,Fit length and design were perfect i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change,1
3271,Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit welleven with stretch added so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif midrise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great they were long enough as well i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well these are not old lady pants eitherhow nice,1
3272,Ordered this with my bday discount the small felt a bit roomy so i took it to the store so i could possibly exchange for an xs i literally could not even get my arm in the xs tried a different small which was more fitted than the small i had received so i would say the sizing can be inconsistent,1
3273,Very cute and comfortabledoes run big i used the size chart and its very generouswould order down a size next time,1
3274,This jumpsuit is very comfortable the material is soft the waist is elasticised it is not drawstring as it seems in the photos,1
3275,This lounge robe is the most fantastic dramatic and comfortable wrap dress to the reviewers who posted picturesyou styled this to perfection a slip dress underneath is a must have since the opening basically unsecured i purchased the medium petite and i am dd and,1
3276,I bought this in navy medium after looking at it online and reading all of the reviews i am so glad i did it hangs beautifully and i have worn it nearly every day since it arrived i am and dd on top with narrow shoulders and a short torso so not easy to fit this is very well made and a medium to heavy cotton perfect for spring and foggy evenings in california in fact i am wearing my new sweater over my friday casual tee at work today if you ware hesitating the purchase at co,1
3277,I ordered the neutral in a p i had to hem them i about lbs i wore them to wore they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen but they didnt look like i slept in them i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair a bit disappointed debating if theyll stay or get returned i see the notes about stretching overall a nice pant for the money,1
3278,This sweater is very warm yet light the pink color is very cute and the buttons are detailed very nicely it hangs a bit low under the arms and definitely tightens at the wrist i ordered the xs size and i find that i am unable to push the sleeves up this is so beautiful and has a subtle uniqueness,1
3279,Looks great with skinny jeans leggings trouser wide leg good length for a flattering look longer in front on me than on model so soft doesnt cling not overwhelming because the sleeves are skinny and drape is narrow,1
3280,I bought this tank on a whim without trying it on in the store in black the detail on the front is cute and the peplum is really cute without being frumpy at all i am usually a small ocassionally a medium in retailer shirts and i bought this in small it fits but i feel like i could have gone up to a medium its just a little tight across the chest but i do have more broad shoulders than most so maybe its just because of that the fabric is nice and stretchy so i might be able to get away,1
3281,I love byron lars dresses and this design is onpoint the ruffle at the neckline is so pretty and the dress fits like a dream however the fabric i would have loved it if this dress had a heavier feel this is sadly going back today,0
3282,I was very disappointed by the fit of this top it is quite short especially in the back and very wide i did not find it flattering on a positive note the fabric is nice and thick very warm layering piece for fall for sizing reference im lbs and took my usual size xs,0
3283,These jeans are perfect in every way the rise is perfect the stretch is perfect we need more washes in this exact fit i wish there was more consistency between pilcro denim washes of the same style,1
3284,I bought this in the white size m lbs b because i wanted a baggy fit which i got so this is tts the white is more of an offwhite rather than a bright white which i like because i happen to be looking for an offwhite tee and the shape is goodeven in a larger size this tee nips in at the waisthowever the quality of this tee is lacking as it is the typical cheap marled slightly seethrough material that seems to be everywhere these days and the band on the back of th,0
3285,I love this sweater the sky color is very flattering in person i love that it looks good open or closed i bought one for my mom and me i think it will be very versatile i think it runs mostly true to size possibly runs just slightly big,1
3286,I have blazers in size from this designer and they fit with room to spare i understand this is a more fitted style but it is still way too small size and size were not much bigger great colors and cute design but just too small even if you do not plan on buttoning it i hope they bring back this jacket but make it true to size,0
3287,Lets begin with the fabricits heavy but not in a burdensome way as soon as you put it on you feel like you have a quality piece of clothing on next aestheticsthis dress is flowy and feminine and a bonus it made me look bustier than i am perhaps because of the stripes i didnt find myself pulling this dress up all the time once i put it on it stayed in place perfectly bottom line this dress goes from dressy to casual without a second thought and its on salegrab this one,1
3288,As other reviewers mentioned this sweater is truly nice in person i love the different patterns from the fabric the cut is also flattering not boxy the collar on me turend the other way around dark showing and it also looked nice i wasnt planning on buying anything but it was thanskgiving weekend with you know discount not regretting iti will wear it many ways jeans and tshirt for weekends if i get out of my workout clothes but also could be worn over a nice black blou,1

3291,Boy is this a winner the fabric has quite a bit of stretch so it is form fitting but with enough structure that it doesnt make you bulge out in weird places i can wear it with a blazer as a admittedly dressy daytoevening look and i can tell im going to get a lot of mileage out of it for the seasons holiday parties i am bigger on bottom than on top and sometimes that can end up with weird bagginess around the bust for me but not with this dress im tall and so the length is g,1

3295,The jeans are soft and comfortable they are the perfect staple in my closet more colors please,1
3296,I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it im and lbs and ordered the small the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets ive been wearing it with a tank underneath and its been the perfect sweater for fall weather i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but its actually less bulky than other real sweaters i have,1
3297,I always wear dresses because fl is hot this one is easy breezy and fun its trendy without trying too hard nice lines the fabric is nice and soft and washes well the pattern is pretty i got both colors i always get compliments when i wear this dress,1
3298,This shirt was so weirdit does not fit like the photo at all there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottomwhere it meets the other layer i could wear a tankcamisole underneath but it still just did not fit right i do not have a large chest but this was ridiculous beyond that the red color was just okay even though i purchased this on sale it was not worth the price and i returned,0
3299,Love this skirt i ordered a small im about still losing some baby weight so the elastic band is really nice because it will still fit once i get down to really love the cut it falls just above my knees in the front longer in back i wore it to church with a cream top with victorian lace around neck tucked in and added a belt for a nicer finish although the band looks good without the belt too i got tons of compliments from everyone definitely a scoreps shoes are fr,1
3300,This dress is absolutely lovely from the neckline to the fabric really feels like a well made dress i will say that it ran larger than i thought though so keep that in mind it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest still gorgeous though,1
3301,I live in los angeles and this is the perfect beginning of fall jacket ive worn it with dresses and with jeans definitely has enough extra room to slip a hoodie or small seater on underneath when it gets colder its soft and stylish the only downside is that the pockets arent really deep enough to put anything in,1
3302,These cords are greatlightweight for fl winters and the bootcut flare bottom is super cute with ballet flats or booties i am and typically a size the size fit perfectly they have a little stretch to them which is great very flatteringwish i could order in more colors,1
3303,This dress is fantastic super flattering and unique i get a compliment every time i wear it i encourage retailer to source more dresses from this branddesigner lovely i am picky and nevery give a perfect rating this dress got all stars,1
3304,Velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors they did and i got more i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely thank you for great choices of unique clothing,1
3305,I was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy this top fit the bill the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out it does run big so i recommend sizing down also the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem great top,1
3306,This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on i dont usually pay this much for a cardigan but the quality and feel are better than usual,1
3307,This top is simply amazing its a statement top everyone should own the green is so rich and full of life and the floral pattern is just beautiful i got so many compliments on it and i felt like a million bucks confident and trendy love love looovvveee this top,1
3308,Love the colors im and the regular goes down to my ankles like a petite dress would normally if you get petite it would be as high as it is on the model the material is comfortable and i can see this as a pretty versatile piece,1
3309,I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well im very petite on top xsmall and smallmed on bottom usually dresses are tight on my hips thighs and loose up top this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner formfitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places the xsmall and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the xsmall on this one i think this will be a staple winterfall dress loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac,1
3310,I tend to peruse the sale section when i am avoiding my work quite often i came across this top but had never seen it before it was put on sale i was intrigued by the sleeves but concerned that the pattern might be too ornate i was happily surprised when i tried it on the fabric was thick which i find highlights curves and hides rolls the detail was enough that i could dress it up but not so much that i felt awkward wearing jeans,1
3311,I ordered these in both colors the red is much deeper in person more like a burgundy than pictured here these tees are very slouchy if you wanted a more fitted look size down these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans the overall quality seems very good although they are thinner than i thought they would be they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photosoverall these are very nice but there is one is,0
3312,I love this dress i would have never picked it off the hanger in the store in fact i went right past it however when i was in the dressing room trying something else on i saw two girls wearing it and it was adorable i immediately tried it on and loved it i think it runs really big i am normally a size athletic build and i bought the xsmall i small also fit but was a bit too baggy most topsdresses at retailer also run big so it makes sense this does too but there is no way i am a true,1
3313,What a flattering top great with jeans or shorts im a sz and l was perfect for me love the colors got lots of comments,1
3314,This sweater is a lovely color and very soft however the sweater sheds terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance its also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through,0
3315,I purchased the bird design top for my year old daughter the fit was true to size and its a very unique item for casual wear it looks nicer in person than in the photo,1
3316,Seeking the perfect goto dress this one will work for day or night and its an ideal match for transition seasons the best part the cut swing dresses and shifts can tent my slightly topheavy frame this dress brags a sidezipper and slight tapering through waist to create an aline the small petite fits tts for me at size to the fabric is a highquality textured fabric wrinkle free and a great pick for travel best investment ive made this spring,1
3317,I loved the delicate and feminine print of this blouse at first sight the fit was perfect just enough room to be flattering and comfortable without adding any unnecessary bulk the style and print could even be paired with a more classic skirt and pumps and go to the office the length was also spoton its not too long to be a tunic yet long enough to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings on an errandrunning day the blouse is very lightweight and sheer making it that much more comfo,1
3318,This dress makes my heart skip a beat its beautiful soft and colorful its a lovely midi length which can be tricky for lil ole me but its perfect it has slits up the side for an easy breezy look the fabric is so silky pretty form fitting if you buy the right size im a solid have bought heaps of dresses from retailer and i cant stop wont stop,1
3319,This dress hung so nicely on my figure small up top bigger in the hips that i couldnt pass it up the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos it might run a little smallim normally an extra small but it was a little snug in the arms however the small was too big so i would suggest sticking with your usual size the saleslady said would stretch a little i would have loved to try a petite but the store didnt carry petite sizes it will be my goto holiday dress,1
3320,This sweater is perfect finally a sweater that doesnt make me look like a huge boxi bought the blue it has other colors running through it so ill be able to wear it with chinos jeans very pretty flattering i think im going to be wearing this a lot,1
3321,I absolutely love this shirt its a simple tee but the open back adds cute detail to it i ordered a small and it fit perfectly color is beautiful also,1
3322,This top is so comfortable to wear the way that it hangs makes it as light as air wonderful for hot weather the pattern is beautiful,1
3323,This tshirt is very casual so it is perfect for everyday use touch of textile is comfortable so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this tshirt although stripe is a simple design it does not limit your choise of fashion so it can go with almost anything just be aware that this tshirt runs a little larger than the true size,1
3324,I ordered an xxs and it is extremely short in length another customer had a similar review but i still took a chance that it would fit well the sides of the shirt have slits and because the shirt is too short it shows the skin on my hips the rest of the shirt fit fairly well but ill still need to return this top,0
3325,This dress is really beautiful i have already worn it to both an engagement party fancy and just out to dinner casual it fits most occasions depending on what you pair it with which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full moneys worth ive gotten several compliments on it the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it it looks true to the picture on the website the dres,1
3326,Just love sweatshirts ponchos so what an unusual twist of style ordered my usual size s during the promo looks pretty much as in the pic oversized arm openings are created by a string attached to the sides of the garment its ok but may eventually break off maybe ill secure w snaps or just sew it on by hand wore it yesterday w just a tank underneath to lounge around later wore for casual dining it turned cooler changed to a grey tshirt underneath along w dark blue denim skinnys,1
3327,I love this dress its cotton but thicker higher quality im going to wear it for nights out and to dinner this summer and its thicker material so i wont even have to wear a bra with it its a little lower cut so be careful im and the extra small hits me right above my ankle,1
3328,I have an hourglass shape and a large chest so its difficult to find dresses that dont like im wearing a sack or are too formfitting to be appropriate this dress is prefect for accentuating my waist while still looking appropriate for weddings and other nice events the color is perfect,1
3329,Okay i am not that tall and dont have legs for miles but i loving wearing a widelegged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday these pants are great because they are cotton the cotton is a nice weight not too light and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail i usually wear a in pilcro and thats what i bought i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green though it did look little green under the lights in the store,1
3330,I thought this top would make me look extremely boxy but i couldnt resist the stripes and the cut of the top i did size down and so glad i did adorable fun and flattering and thats coming from a curvy girl with a ddd bust soo soft,1
3331,Vibrant lovely and quite long this maxi works for leggy bettys i stand in my stocking feet and the dress hem grazed the floor not quite as voluminous as the photo suggests but stunning nonetheless runs a bit small i normally wear xs to s and i tried a xs instore but it fit just eversoslightly too snug i didnt try a size s but i suspect it may have fit eversoslightly too large,1
3332,I ordered this top on a whim and never in a million years did i expect to love it as much as i did while it is by no means work appropriate it is a fun top for a night out the material is light and flowy and it drapes perfectly over my post baby tummy i tried it on with jeans shorts and white pants and it really looked great with all items wish this came in a few other colors for reference i am a dd and a size took the large and it looked flowy without being maternity topish,1
3333,I have these pants in the brown red colors and i love them both equally they are stretchy and stretch out a very little bit as you wear them but retain their shape neatness,1
3334,I loved this dress and it fit perfectly i did not have any issue with the camisole being tight and i am really curvy i did however have a problem trying to take it off it has no zipper and in order for me to get it over my head i had to stretch my shoulders to the point where i ripped the back i went to the store and tried on the larger size and ripped that one too i tried to take it off more delicately but i couldnt maybe it was me but this dress is too much hassle if i went any highe,0
3335,This top is not bmeant to be super fitted it is flowy and romantic i have ordered the petite to decide which size to keep but my usual xs was fine wil ljsut compare length i was also curious about hte smaller size but didnt order it so i wil lnever knowthe only color i saw in person is the black on and it is calssic so i went with it shall wait for petite verdict,1
3336,Should have listened a previous review while this is a very well made garment it really does remind me of a bathrobe and will be returning too bad because the fabric and stripes are really great alsothis runs very large the extra small was more like a medium,0
3337,This was just what i wanted a simple design so many of retailers suits have way too much going on and this one fit the bill sexy strappy and clean i cant wait to live in this top this summer,1
3338,I tried on the xs in the store and decided to size down and get xxs petite it looked much better the length was flattering and as others mentioned the bottom is nice and flowy it is comfortable and the orange color is flattering and i love the striped detail on the sides good casual dress but i can dress it up with a bejeweled belt i am lbs dd chest for xxs petite,1
3339,Its the inverted invert not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore,0
3340,This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine but i was surprised that its also really comfortable it provides a pretty good amount of support especially for an unlined bra and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there my b fit true to size,1
3341,I just need to write a review on this sweater because its the best i currently own the creamblue stripe sweater and have recieved many compliments what i was most happy about it was the fact that i have washed it several times and the sweater looks like new and has held its shape i have ordered the gold one as well and its still on backorder waiting for it to arrive dont procrastinate its worth the price,1
3342,Got these shorts in both colors the bluegray and the redpink super lightweight in hot humd weather and keeps a crisp shape doesnt get wrinkly and saggy like other linen shorts do really nice quality interior finish and both front and back pockets are a usable depthif youre between sizes go for the smaller as they do stretch a bit over the day i got these in a size and they get a little loose on my ish frame im and the petite was sold out so i dont know if t,1
3343,The tank looks nothing like the one pictured mainly because its tissuepaper thin also i ordered it in two sizes xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large the armholes hit halfway to my waist obviously i didnt even bother opening the size s both will be returned,0
3344,It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailers pants are cut for slim figured women this rare pair of pants crosses the divide flattering both shapes i usually have to look for xls here i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l these pants are great they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections they will be my go to summer pant i love them,1
3345,This dress is gorgeous the store only had a size so i am waiting for my size to arrive very pretty navy color super cute love all the embroidery detail my niece is getting married in june and i cant wait to wear iti normally wear a or judging by the fit i think the will be perfect,1
3346,This top is so lovely but runs soo big i ordered it online and was so surprised when i tried it on at home im normally a size and i was positively swimming in this top hoping to exchange for a petite sm,0
3347,Purchased this in the wine color and love it the detail at the neck at the bottom hem gives it an extra flair i went with a small so that it was more fitted love that it is stylish and comfortable paired with knee high boots given it length but could also work well with short boots like the photo,1
3348,Thin for this late in the season but the colors are so pretty im going to layer it over a long sleeve t top with a cardi and pair with leggings runs large love the the unconnected slip stars,1
3349,I ordered this dress in navy for fall and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe i am lbs and size in jeans i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy making it more modest but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figureaccentuating look the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel the navy flower,1
3350,I opened the package and the dress is two pieces it is the skirt part with an orange cami top that the sweater goes over the sweater was too short for me as i am busty and would not work i ordered my normal size and the band around the rib cage did not go from side to side so i didnt try it on,0
3351,First this picture does not do this shirt justice in fact the hanger does not do this shirt justice you must try this shirt on it drapes so well not as soft as some cloth stone tops but it is still very soft the slightly stiffer feel makes it easier to dress up theres no pockets which is nice in a button down it drapes in a very flattering way ive never been happier with a clothstone garment i normally wear a small in this brand and that is true for this top as well however,1
3352,I love this top it looks as great in person as it does online it does require some adjustment while wearing because it slips up onto the shoulders more than i prefer the quality is nice and it is very pretty it is great with skinny jeans and heels for a fall look,1
3353,This shirt is so cute alone with jeans or dressed up with nice jewelry a scarf or cardi its just the right weight true to size drapes nicely and its very flattering im sorry i didnt order more when i had the chance its already sold out in the colors and sizes i wanted excellent quality as usual thanks again retailer,1
3354,I have a number of sweaters from moth and they never disappoint the ones made with this ultra soft and warm yarn are my favorite i bought both colors i wear it with jeans or dressier clothes id say its very versatile,1
3355,This is a beautiful dress great and flattering fit comfortable adorable print the blue is stunning and nice movement one cant really see it in the photos but the skirt is actually pleated imo this adds interest and originality to the dress ive been getting lots of compliments get it while you can,1
3356,I purchased this jacket as a gift for my daughter for christmas i thought it would look nice on her and i love retailer she was very surprised and loved it she wore the jacket the next day and it looked lovely on her a very unique and beautiful addition to her wardrobe,1
3357,Looks and fits just like the picture fabric is nice and soft looking forward to wearing this tunic as soon as the weather cools just a little,1
3358,These pants are so great light comfortable and reasonably priced they are very well made and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking theres a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me theyre like classier lounge pants,1
3359,This is the softest most comfortable dress ever i bought a large because it was the only one in stock at the store im and its a little loose but still flattering and comfortable due to my height if you are tall you will not be disappointed w this dress,1
3360,I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look its a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type which is tall and thin i think this dress would not work on a more busty womans frame but it definitely works for me im and pounds and a small is plenty big i often take a medium i definitely recommend this dress,1
3361,I just got this top today the print is just as beautiful in person as it is on the web it is so incredibly soft and comfortable i tried it on and it fits just like the photo i am so i can get away with the blousy effect but i think that is part of why it is so charming i think you could dress it up or down really well i am really pleased,1
3362,I just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual so i bought the and it fits just fine d the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage ss and so cute i didnt find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this i highly recommend,1
3363,This top exceeded my expectations i got it in the gray striped pattern size small its probably the combination of the pattern and the removable padding that makes it very flattering on my small chested figure i would imagine big chested gals would not find enough support in this one though the fabric is very soft and comfortable with just enough stretch overall very happy with this top but does it have to be so expensive retailer,1
3364,These pants are amazing they are so comfortable and fit true to size i typically wear a or depending on the pants and the s fit me perfectly i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive i want every color,1
3365,I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price its perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down its a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit definitely worth the sale price,1
3366,I have been searching for these pants my whole life i have them in several colors i wear the moss most often id recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes they stretch a bit as you wear them one other thing after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly,1
3367,This top is great and perfect for fallwinter ive gotten a lot of wear out of this so fargreat with jeans and sneakers for a casual look or dress it up with black jeans and boots great layering piece as well the fabric is soft and comfortable the fit is nice and relaxed but tailored on the sides to give you some shape the colors are beautifulgreat buy i highly recommend,1
3368,This dress is so pretty the colors are vibrant beautiful pattern the ruched part in the center hides the tummy the neck line was too low for me so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist so instead of skin color it was now red even more prettier no body could tell got so many compliments,1
3369,Online this dress caught my eye but the reviews seemed to indicate there was something weird with the length so i did not want to order it online and have to send it back etcbecause i am and did not know weather to get the petite or the regular my local store had it and i bought a regular small and it is not too long it comes just to the ground in the back like any other maxi it is super comfortable and gorgeous i am not sure where i am going in it yetbut it was just too pretty o,1
3370,Really cute top the embroidery on the collar bib of this top is beautiful and unique received lots of compliments questions about where i got it im rather busty up top and the medium fit well a small probably wouldve fit better but its still super adorable,1
3371,The online pic does not even do this beautiful blouse justice in person it is stunning and goes with everything,1
3372,These are really stunning they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams i love the mirror image pattern theyre just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on but once on they actually fit perfectly so i think thats actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit im and i got the xs,1
3373,Cute top and flattering to wear fits nicely and id say true to size cant wait to wear it,1
3374,I ordered a small and the top part was huge yet the bottom a little snug you need a big chest and small legs and bottom too bad its very cute,0
3375,In my opinion the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase adorable cut and style comfortable and cute its the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans love this,1
3376,I have these pants in the bluegrey color and like them so much i got them in olive wash well fit perfectly easy to throw on and look great,1
3377,I purchased all of the colorpattern offered all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build i felt these were in general true to size no doubt i will wear these all winterthanks antro,1
3378,I am now the third person to try this dress and return it for the same reason the empire waist is too high and hits across the bust instead of underneath it i cant imagine how they got it to fit this model so well i am petite and i really love the idea of a maxi with sleeves so i decided to try it even through the two previous reviewers reported this issue unfortunately i had the same problem i am a c cup size perhaps this would work on a very thin figure with a small bust i ordered t,0
3379,I know this product description says oversized but thats an understatement i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their fathers jacket i dont even think an xs would have worked im and about pounds for reference i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but its just way too big,0
3380,I cant stand buying pants and i can see the pockets lining and my darker skin through the fabric i dont consider that highquality,0
3381,I love these leggings so much i bought them in every colordesign they are amazingsuper stretchy and great for an active lifestyle be it pilates yoga playing with kids at the park or coffe with the girls,1
3382,Such a great purchase the fit is so flattering to my frame i usually wear an extra smallsmall but i opted for an extra small after reading a review im glad i did i also did not get the petite but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has it flows yet hits my curves in all the right places i will say im a c cup and if you have larger breasts the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me the black is so slimming especially when pared,1
3383,I love wearing this it is a little slice of summer which i am desperately hanging on to the color pops its so very comfortable the back is a work of art can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt or down with capri style pants,1
3384,This coat is simply beautiful i love the slits on the sides it makes it unique and sexy i would suggest that you go up a size so the silhouette is not disturbed by any pulling or tugging im so happy with my purchase,1
3385,I purchased this in the mauve color beautiful color with tan skin for the summer but also perfect for fall the material is very thin but not sheer at all has quite a bit of drapeswing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough it fits me like it fits the model shown here i am about lbs and b and am keeping the small,1
3386,Blue jeans that fit like a dream they were on sale,1
3387,The fabric and cut of this blouse are beautiful but the v was so deep i could never wear it without a cami and i think that would ruin the look i have a large chest but the similarly cut blouse without the textured fabric from the same designer fit me fine this one is just cut differently i even tried sizing up and down to no avail the photo on the model seems misleading because i dont see how the neck would lay flat or stay that high on anyone even with a smaller chest i was so,0
3388,I was so curious to see this skirt it looks just like pic really gorgeous bold pattern and a faux suede like fabric my only problem was that i thought there was too much fabric i love maxi skirts i am quot and lbs it was a bit long on me but just had too much fabric i have slim hips but this made them look larger skirt is almost ballroom gown like in its fullness loved it and someone else might love it but for me it was too much wish it worked,0
3389,Best jumpsuit ever so soft and always gets compliments get one now before theyre gone also it is supposed to be tied in front im and the small petite is just perfect,1
3390,Chic and comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings im usually a smallmedium and thought the medium had a better overall look sleeves were just a little long the detail on the sleeves is kind of like the inside of a sweatshirt and makes it look a little more polished than the average athleisure top,1
3391,So youre thinking this is a red and black skirt right nope its an obnoxious cherry red netting with cranberry crushed velvet insets overlaid on bright red actual spandex spandex that shows every wrinkle and panty line its really god awful,0
3392,Fun top for day or evening,1
3393,When i saw this online it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood but with looser arms and a generally looser fit just be aware it has bat wings or something not sure what it is called there isnt one picture included with an arm lifted so without a really close look the arms look loose but normal i returned it,1
3394,This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch the sweater is true to size though a bit boxy so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look the sweater is a little on the short side but im petite so i thought the regular xxs was perfect the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day it did start to pill after one wear but this is the nature of cashmere im very pleased,1
3395,I like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous its seriously unflattering i usually between a m a l and i got a small and its still massive but the slip is tiny it looks so cute in the picture but not good in person,0
3396,I bought this shirt in a l since i didnt want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be it is so boxy its like a completely different shirt i have no idea how it looks good on anyone unless it is simply widened the larger the size maybe a m wouldnt be as wide and therefore as boxy but this shirt is just a bad mess returning,0
3397,Unlike the other two reviews i found this dress horrid i ordered a xs since i am between that and a s it was just too much fabric for me i have a small frame so it was just so overwhelming the armholes were big and i felt like i had a bag on me colors were nice and fabric was soft and light the belt made no sense as others have said length was good i tried it on as soon as i got it and couldnt take it off fast enough i literally ran to the post office and back it goes this is my,0
3398,I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect i wear it all the time its comfortable and its cute plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it,1
3399,This jacket is totally adorable i wore it with a man tailored shirt with the color up and the sleeves poking outit has a great swing to it and is very comfortable it is sized perfectly and i got it on sale,1
3400,I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on the vest fits so well and the thick fabric feels amazing love the pockets like the previous reviewer i feel like ill be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit it has an ever so slight racer back so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it the draping in the front also falls really nicely great bu,1
3401,This fits me more like a tunic so i wear it with jeggings i am and usually a petite and the s fit wellthe arms are stretchy which i like since i have an athletic build love the butterfly pattern,1
3402,I am usually a regular xs with retailer tops i took a chance and went with the xxs in blue and am not regretting it super comfortable top fits perfect and will be great for work,1
3403,Love this cardigan it is a really a sweet and sexy top so flattering to curves and yet conceals too the material is wonderfully soft and stretchy,1
3404,I love these shorts would buy them in every color the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too not too short not too tight very soft comfy feel,1
3405,These run at least sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand mother such a bummer because the quality is totally on point im going to exchange them for a huge size i guess whatever i dont mind having a size thats so much larger than all my other jeans i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control its not retailers fault so annoyed,0
3406,I love simple comfortable tops with interesting details and one that i can easily throw on without much fuss this top is made for people like me the ribbed knit is super soft without being too thin the lace is quite pretty without being too delicate normally tops like this have the lace portion sewn to the hem but this top actually has a whole layer of lace under the knit outer shell so its like wearing a layer of lace and ribbed sweater on top of the lace the good news is the lace,1
3407,Theres just the right amount of billowy grace in this dress the fit is perfect and the material moves and breathes with you cute with a jean jacket on chillier days too,1
3408,This is a beautiful sweater with deep rich colors i purchased the blue motif the problem is that the models are small busted which allows the side panels and front panel to lay nicely and swing in a flattering manner i am pounds and a d i usually wear a small in antro tops i purchased this online and was excited upon its arrival when i tried it on i was horrified it looked like a babydoll maternity sweater on me the front did not lay well flat at all from the chest d,0
3409,This skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than im used to in my closet but thats not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing it runs a little large in the waist also the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh however i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come,1
3410,After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xss was still wayyy too big for reference i am and a ddd and usually wear an but this thing was enormous it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon such a disappointment the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,0
3411,Love these tanks so much i have them in every color i wear them layered under blouses thermals henleys blazers etc im typically and extra small but the small fits perfectly,1
3412,This sweater is very cute it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear i am a smallmedium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing i have the blue and oatmealbeige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe,1
3413,I bought one of each color love them all they fit well and are very soft washing and drying them are not a big issue either i didnt notice any shrinking i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut for this i bought a small im a lbs its loose and flowy without being overly baggy the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt if youre going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans the buttons on the side might get in the way a little but that doesn,1
3414,Im mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors somehow this top was love at first sight it looks simple but its not its unique in its own way look at the back the slightly puffy sleeves the side slit and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot so cute i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online im b waist hips i know the price seems,1
3415,Immediately loved this when i saw it online and even more in person im only so i tried the petite sizing first but ended up buying the regular in an xs for the slightly longer length the regular fit me like the model in length and i probably could have taken the xxs except the sleeves were too narrow in that size i like that the cuffs are long so if you have to turn it up like i do it doesnt look weird also i found the fit flattering at the hips following my hourglass shape withou,1
3416,This dress is beautiful the neckline is not too low and the straps are wide enough so you can wear a normal bra the waist is very flattering and the ruffle at the bottom is not too much i am short so i ordered the petite and it is a perfect fit now i just need some warmer weather,1
3417,Picked this up in the white and its adorable im a in maeve blouses usually just to fit my bust i picked it up in the because thats all my store had and it fits its definitely tight across the bust but not constricting the shirt has no give but its still comfy and to be expected from cotton the peplum is very dramatic highlow and poofs out in the back also a little dramatically but gosh thats what makes it so gorgeous great blouse so precious,1
3418,This dress embodies the retailer brand the design is unique and form fitting for just about any body type beautiful saturated colors and a great cut make it an all around classic i wish for more of these designs i originally ordered my usual size but went down to a this dress runs large looks great with heels or boots as pictured i am lb this dress has a timeless quality that you will wear for years to come at my age i try to buy things that i will wear for many sea,1
3419,Love this top it is exactly as pictured online its a beautiful coral pink color perfect for summer i think the description says red but it is definitely pink i love the swiss dot material the bell sleeves the ruffled bottom they all work perfectly together to make for an adorable top it almost seems as if it can be worn off the shoulder due to the elastic neckline but i prefer it on as pictured on the model the fit is tts i ordered an xs and that is what i usually wear fro,1
3420,I was fortunate to buy one of the last petite mediums in this style the knit is soft and comfortable and doesnt seem likely to snag there are a variety of stitches through the upper areas which add subtle differences the colors are fantastic this will be great for the cooler months it looks fabulous with denim,1
3421,I loved this jacket it is very cute until i washed it i followed the care instructions and it still does not wash well the arms shrank about half an inch making them a little short i have been rolling them up,1
3422,Eva franco has done it again by creating another fabulously flattering unique and compliment grabbing skirt it runs true to size and is very easy to move in and wear this is my th skirt of hers and i love them all,1
3423,Ordered online and love itexchanging however from s to m cos the fit is so perfect and i want to allow for extra room at the festive season,1
3424,I purchased this dress in my normal small size via online i exchanged it it for a medium in the store as the shoulders were just a little too tight for me i plan on wear it with tightsleggings as its a little to short on my frame well made and the bodice has so much detail but not over the top,1
3425,I am amazed this is still on sale its so comfortable and fabulous,1
3426,I ordered this dress online but it turned out to be too small i loved the color fabric and overall quality i should have ordered one size up,1
3427,Tried this on a whim in store and it might not look like much on the hanger but this beauty fits perfectly and is quite flattering it is loose without being billowy still has nice tailoring for shape the fabric is light but good quality and the pattern is super cute i was shocked when i saw that the price was much lower than expected this is a true win even at full price for reference im lbs and took my usual size s,1
3428,This was exactly as expected i ordered my usual size medium fit well good quality fabric its one of my comfy weekend go to items,1
3429,This is a great dress its cut nicely is flattering and its not too short if i put it on i look put together in a matter of seconds the dress fits true to size one thing i would agree with the other review that this is not really tweed instead it is made out of a patterned stretchy material that is a little thinner than tweed the colors are really beautiful and while the blues and reds are more intense in real life it looks terrific,1
3430,I love this dress it is super cute and comfy i am and a size small and c and i got this dress in a and it fits great a might be a little more fitted on my waist but the is comfortable and looks great the length is perfect not too short at all,1
3431,I love that the dress slip got a different pattern very easy fun for summer but you can also layer it in fall,1
3432,These pants have great style and movement,1
3433,This top is so soft and with a henley neck opening and longer ribbed shirttail hems it not only feels heavenly against the skin but it gives off a casual chic vibe it is also great for layering under shorter sweaters and sweatshirts to give my staples a little oomph it is a bit sheer so cami is a must i am also not sure how well it will hold up after washings especially since its priced quite high i love it so much that i will most probably end up keeping it it is true to size i ordered,1
3434,This is a quirky whimsical uniquely designed top thats sure to get a lot of comments and opinions and hopefully good ones i really love it think it is what it is a fun conversation piece and isnt that whats great about fashion tts very comfy yes boxy but i dont think in a bad way the ruffle on the bottom is adorable would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties or even a darker denim hits mid bum nice quality too,1
3435,This skirt is stunning the red is so vibrant this will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come it can be dressed up or down love it,1
3436,This is the softest flannel ever while i dont think id wear it outside it is super comfy just lounging around it runs very large but since its a flannel romper not a problem absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes,1
3437,In nature pilco fashion these jeans are amazing i wear them rolled down they have a slight boot cut but not overly i am and the bottoms fall right to my heel meaning the hem doesnt drag on the groundfinally the perfect pair of jeans they also do not stretch out and keep shape after wearin all day highly recommend although a little pricy for pilcro worth the splurge,1
3438,After reading the previous reviews i ordered a size larger i am so glad i did it it fits perfectly i am dd and went with the s regular so beautiful i cant wait to wear it,1
3439,I have wanted a boiled wool jacket for years finally i got the graynavy soft warm and classic i expect it to last forever it is the right weight for out door wear in warmer climates or late fallearly spring in minnesota the sleeves are long but push up nicely and roomy enough to go over a long sleeved blouse i paired it with the tartan charlie trousers and it is very polished for work soft but someone sensitive to wool might find it itchy i agree that it is a little boxybut i t,1
3440,This dress is even better in person than in the photos online the colors are vibrant the material has a nice warm weight to it and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it didnt fall offthe dress does run a little small i think i normally am an extra small but the small fit me very well,1
3441,This is a super cute peasant top super light weight and perfect for summer looks good with jeans or shorts perfect for summer spring or fall colors are super pretty and bright,1
3442,A great wrap dress with many buttons the dress stays on better than any other wrap dress i ever owned,1
3443,I ordered this dress in both a petite xs and regular xs and the petite fit the best for the first time in my life i did not have to shorten a maxi dress and i am ft the color is a beautiful dark blue not sure why the color online says charcoal and the opening at the chest area is a little low but nothing that double sided tape can not fix another bonus as other reviewers have stated is that you can wear a regular bra lastly it does not wrinkle so you can bring this on vacation,1
3444,This is a super cute tshirt it runs a little big and not as long as some tshirts which is good it hits midhip on me and im i got the gray at my retailer store and liked it so much i ordered the black one too warning the black one is actually a brownishblack which i didnt like so back it goes,1
3445,I got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas it looked adorable and long on the model however it doesnt even cover my butt thats how short it is if youre anything over id say itll be too short for leggings,0
3446,I bought this in the store because it was irresistible generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks the colors are delicious they go with everything in the greyroseblue pallet the fabric is superb heavy and glossy good for cold weather the size is generous in the upper body not so much in the hips i usually take a small or medium there were only smalls left in the store so i couldnt try an xs the reversible inside fabric is a complete,1
3447,I bought a petite size i am lb it fit perfect with a tiny bit of room looks just like the one pictured length on me was about inch lower than the model very bright with multiple colors has a nice stretch very cute,1
3448,I got this when it went on sale in navy and coral colors awesome dress for any occasion as far as complaints go about the straps its meant to be lowcut i really like the basket weave bodice although that does make it more difficult to zip up but i found it was easier to just slip the dress on zipped up since the stretchy fabric gives quite a bit rather than deal with the zipper i normally wear about a in most retailer brands and have the dress in both sizes didnt notice a big differ,1
3449,I tried on the petite in the store and loved it its just the color kind of washes me out a bit nut i did love hte fit and style,1
3450,Its like a coat for your legs and lined with some silky fabric the only flaw is a slight bulkiness where the fly hooks up i am a little sad that they dont have a petites because i think this is proportioned for women and over and i am only also not recommended for anyone with a tummy pooch so tall women with somewhat flat abs snap it up its a fabulous look for you,1
3451,I got the blue print and i love it easy to match with any bottom really i like that it can be made strapless,1
3452,I love this dress wasnt much on the hanger but fell in love as soon as i put it on almost returned after reading the reviews about the fabric content and printed design instead of embroidered but tried it on one last time and decided to keep it the silhouette is just stunning absolutely stunning this will be a classic piece in my wardrobe that i pass down to my children one day,1
3453,This is a very flattering blouse but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size so order down the fabric is cotton gauzy and light it is very soft on the skin i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on but i decided to keep it and im glad i did it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer and because of the lightness of the fabric it does not app,1
3454,I am a big fan of maeve tops i love the beading and structure of this top despite the fullness of the design the fit is flattering,1
3455,I purchased the blue a bluish gray size mediumthe entire top including the fluttery sleeves drapes wonderfully and is sooo soft i wish i could wear this topthis silhouette every day its versatile enough to do so if only the other colors were flattering to my coloring sleeves im thrilled to find a shirt that fitsflatters my proportional curves and sports sleeves that dont grip my biceps often i must choose to fit my arms or fit my torso unless i want the additional step,1
3456,I just received my duster i love it the coat is as pictured the fabric is medium weight denim with some stretch it feels like a denim coat that you have worn for years im and the duster hits midcalf im a curvy size and the xl fits perfectly the only issue that might arise is that the sleeves are long they fit me perfectly but i have long arms this will be my new go to coat for fall,1
3457,The second this dress arrived in my store i knew it was a must have i am all things bohemian and this dress encompasses everything wonderful about a free fitting feminine bohemian dress first off the sleeves are not fitted they have quite a bit of fabric to them big armed ladies rejoice but have an elastic cuff so you can wear them high or low the only fitted part to this dress is the lace panel which still fits true to size and the slip underneath which appears to have a bit of str,1
3458,These are adorable and very very comfortable im loving the flattering mid riseas stated before there is no flare as depicted in the photo but still super cutenice with flats easy to dress up with some sexy heels,1
3459,I got this skirt because its elegant and can be worn in three seasons it is stylish and can easily be dressed up or down i usually wear an xs in bottoms and this runs about one size large in the waist area still i am keeping it and plan to have it altered it is cute and completely worth the extra effort,1
3460,I disagree with the reviewer that says these are more straightlegged for me they fit tight throughout sits perfectly on the waist with just enough stretch but they still look very structured im lbs and the fit me perfectly the length was perfect for my height often pants are too loose in the ankle for me but these are snug and perfect to wear with booties,1
3461,I received this dress in both colors oatmeal and blue for christmas and i love them they are super comfortable and great with leggings i can wear them just to lounge around the house or dress them up a bit for church i am and lbs and i got the small it fits true to size i would definitely recommend,1
3462,The color is a nice cool red and the material is very soft but the dress left me feeling shapeless and the bell sleeve overtook it i wanted to love it but it just wasnt working for me im and purchased a s it fits true to size however it was loose around the waist and just wasnt complimentary on me this will have to go back,0
3463,This tank caught my eye when it first came out couple of months ago love the colors and the embroidery especially the colors on top beautifu and it will complement any skin tone and the bottom is neutral so that this top will go with any bottom this flows too goes great with skinny jeans and flats or put a strappy heels on and its perfect for evening outings,1
3464,Purchased in a small usually a i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing great for those tighter dresses the fabric is sheer but not super see through the tassle in the back is so creative it closes enough in the back to not look weird i have so many plans for this piece black is the perfect color too the collar colors are perfect too,1
3465,Love this dress i agree with the other reviewers i had to size up one size but then it was perfect im lbs and the size worked great,1
3466,If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors its flowy comfortable and a must have,1
3467,I tried a size x small on in the store and i am lbs i had trouble getting my head through the dress and once i did it felt so tight at the neck as if it was chocking me the dress color is very nice but the tight neck and odd arm holes were a no i would not recommend this dress for those reasons,0
3468,I wore this dress yesterday for the first time and got several compliments its unique and superpretty in person it hides flaws well and the material is nice i must have bigger arms than the model because you can barely tell from the picture what the arm slits look like i dont mind the way they look butthe way the piece of fabric there grazed on my arms all day kept making me feel like my bra strap had fallen down speaking of bra straps the neckline is wide and i felt like i kept havin,1
3469,This is absolutely beautiful but i am only and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots likewise i did not detect even a speck of black to me it is navy and purple i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think youre going to have to do navy or denim,1
3470,This adorable dress has surpassed my expectations i ordered an xs and s and am keeping the xs for reference im lbs c and the xs fits like a dream its not sacklike at all the top is fitted and the bottom flairs very flatteringly the bell sleeves arent too long like some ive seen the color and print are the epitome of fall the length is perfect its long enough for work but short and flirty enough for evenings out i can imagine wearing with heels or booties,1
3471,I have a hard time finding slacks that are a step up from jeans and that is why these are such a great find they feel great fit well the price was good even before i got them on sale i love the color and they seem like they will be easy to take care of wish they came in more colors,1
3472,I love this dress it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable i cant wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals,1
3473,I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats i have tried several different brands and these are amazing they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom i am so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress cant fix i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som,1
3474,I have this in both the black and red great design very flattering and soft the red is the perfect color will get a lot of west from these for many years,1
3475,I really wanted to like this shirt the quality is amazing and much prettier in person but it is hard to take care of if you wash it the wrinkles are horrible so it has to be dry clean only also the back is ridiculously long it looks very odd from the side view,0
3476,I bought this dress for my bridal shower its beautiful tts i usually wear in retailer and the small was perfect i tried on in store and the dress had a few snags and defects they ordered me one to be delivered to my apt and it was perfect the back is pretty too,1
3477,I saw this on a model in the house and home catalog it looked very comfy but with an edge of elegance i saw it in store in the navy and loved it the other color is very washed out not good for me being a blonde i didnt try it on and got a small as it looked as it ran a little large im lbs and it fit perfectly it hits above knee a little longer than on model it hangs beautifully and the blue color is stunning looks expensive i received a few complements the first time i w,1
3478,Great dress that can be dressed up for work day or even dressed down for a nice weekend dayi have it in black but thinking of buying in the yelloworange color too,1
3479,This romper is adorable i love the long sleeves,1
3480,When i walked into my retailer store i was immediately drawn to this top the online photo really does not do it justice in person it is stunning im petite and usually a size but the only sizes available were a and a it looked large so i tried the it actually fit much better than i expected considering i have a dd bust but the seam across the chest was too tight however i did not have a problem with the armholes even going down two sizes i have narrow shoulders so maybe that,1
3481,I bought the xs regular and it was a little too long and wide i was unable to find a petite version in the store or online the ruffles were also bigger than how they appear on the model i am tall and weigh lbs i believe the petite would have been a much better fit i regret not discovering this top sooner when more size options were available,0
3482,This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure the cut is very s through the sleeves and neckline its a little cropped and boxy just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips it looks phenomenal with a crinolined aline skirt,1
3483,Just what i was looking for soft cozy and warm,1
3484,Just received this dress and i am in love the colors are beautiful perfect for both summer and fall the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer it was completely sold out in my size however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color and now lined yay i had to buy it would defin recommend,1
3485,Great alternative to yoga pants these pants are stylish and ontrend but also easy going dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort,1
3486,Its the perfect sweatshirt super comfortable but also cute i am and pounds and the size fits perfectly,1
3487,I dont know who this would fit looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress but just looked like a sack i think the knit must have stretched into an unnatural shape especially the arms,0
3488,I took a chance and ordered extra one for my daughterwithout ever running it by her first id first seen the sweater in the store when another customer was tracking it down it looked so nice and unique i couldnt forget about it even though i didnt try it on at the time very happy i got it on saleand so i got twoluckily we go to our different workplaces in different towns,1
3489,This sweater is beautiful but runs large all over i ordered a m and returning for a small hopefully that works,1
3490,I picked this up this weekend so gorgeous i usually dont do maxi length at it can be overwhelming but this is so flattering this is floor length on me i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame ill pair it with a cream blouse pictured to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look im usually a and the small fits perfectly,1
3491,I ordered these pants after seeing the good reviews but i dont agree these are going back i ordered a small im and pounds i am usually between a small and a medium in pants but the small in these pants is huge i could definitely fit into an xs but i also dont think they are very flattering and dont like the feel of the fabric its too bad i love the idea of these,0
3492,My normal size fit tts the length is great im i love the button detail on the bottom makes them a little unique,1
3493,Its a little roomy but this shirt is spectacular ive gotten so many compliments on this one whether worn with jeans work pants or shorts allweather as other reviewers have said the material is sort of sleekfeeling not traditional cotton for me i love that as ive been able to wash stains out of this shirt more easily than i otherwise would i am normally a tiny tiny petite but i ended up buying this in the xs regular because the style worked even though its a bit loose,1
3494,They fit over my fatty belly and make my legs look good comfy nice and not cheezy with a bunch of look more than i would normally pay but i like them,1
3495,The top is nice good quality etc but how do you keep the off the shoulder off the shoulder mine keeps inching up until its just a boring white top with a strange loose neckline,0
3496,I love this sweater especially the color i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange the fit was perfect i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings,1
3497,Fits great super comfortable i love this dress,1
3498,Sizing im have broad shouldersback c d short waist and i usually wear a m in a knit top thats what i bought so id say that this tee is tts it is a little longer in the back than front but not as a highlow top would be rather its sort of tuniclike in style i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater and the added length covers me i admit that im a tad on the short side at and that i have no hips straight up and down and no waist my shape is an upsid,1
3499,This bomber really is superb its everything you could want in a jacket beautiful color that goes with so much i got the pink and is so trendy this fall i am and smaller on top so i purchased the small i didnt want it too baggy but i probably couldve sized up to a medium too,1
3500,This dress is beautiful i ordered this in the mail and literally said wow when i took it out of the packaging the color looks more like champagne in person and the flowers look fantastic on it i was worried that it might look a little awkward with so many things hanging off but instead the flowers really compliment the entire ensemble it really just looks like a work of art im usually a small in retailer clothes and that size fits me very well i absolutely love this dress,1
3501,I like that you can dress this shirt up or down go out or lounge in it very comfortable and i would recommend buying it,1
3502,Comfortable and loose fitting perfect for summer weekends when you just want an easy dress to throw on can go from home to running errands to going out for lunch good color too,1
3503,I looked at the other reviews before purchasing and this is the one time it didnt work out for me a lot of people said to size up so i ordered a medium and it was far too big on me i reordered my regular small and its perfect its shorter obviously but not so short that it is unwearable i cant wait to wear this out,1
3504,I love lightweight coatjackets of which this is a great example they effortlessly pull an outfit together and give real personality to simple staples the unstructured linen while indeed lined gives this coat a casual drape for springsummer i see it paired with bright red joggers and a white t with chambray or white linen pants even as a chic beach coverup i untacked the cuffs to give the sleeves a simpler look but its decidedly day and casual as opposed to evening or work wear fu,1
3505,This dress truly is a work of art and i am becoming a little obsessed with byron lars clothing line this is my rd dress by him and i have been a size in the other dresses the does fit in this dress but it is a little snug not sure if a would look as good because it is meant to be form fitting the panels trick the eye into making you look thinner too my dimensions c it fits perfectly in the hips and waist but is tight on top,1
3506,I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale and they are great lightweight roomy in the legs way more my speed i prefer shorts that dont cling and really soft they also werent too short i am usually between two sizes at retailer depending on the brand and ended up going with the smaller size theyre not really a size too big but wouldve been a little too roomybaggy in the waist had i not purchased the smaller,1
3507,Im not sure what it is with ag i own at least a dozen pairs of their jeans in blue black and white denim i wish i could say theyre all great but unfortunately theres a big variation in how they wash depending on the fabric content i just purchased these because i love the lighter wash for spring but after washing them once i can see they wont be a favorite pair even with cold water and hanging them to dry the fabric bunches weirdly and the shape of the leg changes at this price po,0
3508,The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didnt appeal to me but the second time i tried it on and fell in love had to have it in the beautiful blue im busty h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage which was a nice surprise because i usually avoid anything with fullness will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect im short neckline is fem,1
3509,Being a d i was nervous about the gaping between the top two buttons given the other reviews i read theyre right it totally gaps even when standing still so i took it to the tailor they sewed the seam between the top two buttons easy fix for a blouse that otherwise works the color is great i got the red one and i like the fabric i didnt think it hit awkwardly at the bottom seam looks great with skinny white jeans,1
3510,The quality of this jacket is outstanding color combination is very chic and sophisticated jacket is warm but not bulky,1
3511,This is a stunning blouse you cant tell from the photo but it looks very s i am so happy with this blouse it is gorgeous im an xl and purchased this blouse in xl and it fits wonderfully it fits nice and flowy and i feel i dont need a cam underneath i highly recommend it,1
3512,I was a bit apprehensive about buying the top after reading the reviews surprisingly i love the shirt its very feminine soft light for the hot months and figure flattering,1
3513,I ove the interesting details on this pullover it is super cozy on and i love the arched hem and extra long cuffs the crew neck is wide and comfortable but not so wide that you need another shirt underneath great easy pullover with jeans or leggings,1
3514,I tried this black motif on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in loveafter sizing down i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large i am typically a s but sized down to xs and the fit was not even slightly snug the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped skirted bottomvery funky and artylooking i am and the regular length was great on me as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer i also cant wait to layer it,1
3515,Bought this as transitional wear post baby i love them will probably end up wearing them all winter long i love that im foot they still are scrunchy at the bottom which i honestly wasnt expecting,1
3516,Got this in the blue and was so excited while it looks cute someone had clearly bought this worn it and returned it it had human and dog hair all over it not to mention some kind of red strings it was pilling all over so much for quality control i dont mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount,0
3517,This dress is perfect for weekend errands or i could see dressing it up as well the material is a heavier weight will not wrinkle and the pockets are an added bonus i purchased the small in this dress and it is perfect for reference d,1
3518,I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy i didnt think it would be a terribly big deal unfortunately it is normally i wear a size s so i sized down o an xs the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline but the shirt is still very box and now super short unfortunately this is going back not a good fit adorable details but the fit is terrible,0
3519,Every so often the perfect pair of bottoms comes along this style was it for me im tall so the length fits perfect for a crop wide leg trouser i will be able to wear these in the summer as they are light weight enough and also into fall before it gets too cold cant wait to wear them extra bonus i got them on sale if you are short these will probably be more like a long leg trouser on you also fit true to size,1
3520,This top is gorgeous the colors are lovely design and quality are impeccable and it is versatile this top just happened to catchc my eye and i am so happy with my purchase it fits tts i love it,1
3521,I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress and im so glad i did the fit was perfect im always a little hesitant about long dresses since im but the petite length was perfect the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable but i feel elegant in it i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month,1
3522,I love everything about this sweater its well made the color is lovely and best of all i can wear it with skinny jeans without feel overexposed in the back i think my husband thought it was rather shapeless but i like the look of a bigger sweater with a skinny pant a must buy at this great price,1
3523,This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring so disappointing mailing it back,0
3524,It is a great sweater that is soft but also warm i love the pretty design,1
3525,I was thrilled when this shirt arrived it is as cute in person as in the catalog its soft it fit perfect and it looks great with shorts and pants it will be my go to shirt this summer,1
3526,Perfect easy effortlessly beautiful design and just my favorite pajama ever im not my ideal weight right now and these make me feel attractive againlove,1
3527,I hesitantly ordered this cardigan after it spent weeks in my basket i love it i am usually large by retailer brand standards at lbs but the small fit quite big and im glad i didnt go for the larger one it is super unique and cozy i gave it a on quality because the knit is a bit itchy and the fibers do come off on other layers it also is longer than i expected it hits about my mid thigh,1
3528,My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower and of all the lingerie i received that day this was the most memorable it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair i have this in size small and it fits tts love this piece i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot,1
3529,I love these jeans the wash is nice enough for work they fit well around the waist and have just the right midrise height to make them stylish not mom jeans at all i am a pilcro convert very comfortable too,1
3530,I really liked these leggings so comfy they are so soft and the waistband is thickabout an inch wide i am a size in pants i got a size m i have a inch inseam and these came down to my ankles these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip,1
3531,Love this ripplefront top fabric is beautiful love the lining and the fit is perfect looks great with pants and skirts i also love the sleeve length i purchased this in both white and black great for spring and summer,1
3532,The most important thing is that my husband said he really liked the dress when i put it on,1
3533,This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove im a true xs bra size a i ordered the small this was more than worth full price,1
3534,This dress is very cute and well made unfortunately it was too short waisted for me and runs small in the bust the arm holes were too big yet the bust small very weird fit on me i am six feet tall with c bust maybe if you are shorter with smaller chest this dress will work for you it has a thin lining and is not see through even though it is white fabric i love the dress it just wasnt made for my tall figure,0
3535,This dress is comfortable and cute i wear xs and this is true to size the only thing i dont like is the neckline it is very low cut will have to wear a cami underneath,1
3536,This dress is very comfortable lovely and versatile i know i will wear this often throughout the spring and summer months because of its elegant ease i purchased a small and am a c and waist fits perfectly,1
3537,I love the loose vibe of this top the bold stripes are super cute i can dress this up or wear with jeans and sneakers get this top ladies,1
3538,I love this tank i didnt find it to be see through at all it runs true to size its super comfy and the lace up detail makes it more fun than a plain old tank top its a great basic and i love the lilac color,1
3539,Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater quality is wonderful only thing i noticed is that its a little shorter in length then what i was expecting,1
3540,This dress is very flattering on it fits close to the body but the layers are thick so it doesnt show too much the material is stretchy and very cozy im lbs and a c and the medium fit perfectly,1
3541,If you havent yet joined the jumpsuit bandwagon now is the time this jumpsuit is absolutely stunning classy elegant and a stand out piece i purchased at full price i have a hard time with jumpsuits as i am quite tall and they usually look like an adult onsie on me this jumpsuit made me feel beautiful put together and graceful i cannot recommend it enough fit is true to size i am a and purchased the not too short in the crotch and i am almost form fitting but still a bit f,1
3542,I had high hopes ordering this topunfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description it also felt rather cheap scratchy poor quality for the price,0
3543,Didnt work on this curvy galsizing up would have helped with the button gaps but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger sizemajor pass,0
3544,I have an hourglass shape so this skirt is winner for me classic aline fit but with a modern hem its subtly shiny very stylish and comfortable paired with a tight shirt and heels it looks extremely sexy a sale price makes it all the sweeter,1
3545,These jeans are so soft fit is great and i love he higher waist as well i can tell i will be wearing the heck out of these,1
3546,Horrible fit i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress,0
3547,Cute top perfect by itself or for layering i sensed it would run large so i ordered an xxs lbs,1
3548,The bra is comfortable and the design is good however the sizing is way off i am a c and the small fits well with minimal support not sure about quality this one might have to go back,0
3549,I love this dress however its not what i expected based off the pictures the modeled photo indicates that its a shirtdress with a drop waist no its a smock dress with more of an aline silhouette that begins at the shoulders the waistline is more of a detail like the button placket than a structural quality its very youthful and whimsical that said it is quite beautiful the fabric does not wrinkle easily as another reviewer guessed my daughter wrinkled it sitting on my,1
3550,I am petite and ordered size small and it came looking like gym sweat pants the material was very nice but in terms of the waist and length size both run incredibly large the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all and hangs loose widely will have to return this item unfortunately,0
3551,This blouse is stunning i have been wanting it for some time i finally broke down and purchased it i am and about lbs i generally wear size l size i bought this in a large i need a medium for sure i could get away with the large but its very flowy i think the med will be more flattering i am planning to exchange for a smaller size i would recommend this blouse for sure if you want it buy it its often times sold out,1
3552,This dress is so cute will you be bringing it back retailer,1
3553,I ordered this in large since it was the last one available i normally wear a med but i do enjoy the oversize look in silhouettes like this one the armholes are very low but since i have hyperhidrosis excessive sweating this does not bother me one bit ill just wear a super lightweight tank underneath for coverageprotection also the oversize fit allows me to wear a long sleeve for layering if i desire i love the flow and fluidity of the material and will be wearing this one a lot,1
3554,This dress fits awfully its not short as pictured in photo it hit just above my knees it looked like sack i wouldve also felt like i was choking all night with it clasped around my neck it potentially may look okay on someone who is very tall skinny and lanky but i have my doubts about that too,0
3555,I wanted this top so bad i ordered one size up only size left in navy and it is a little big but i still love it so fun love the color,1
3556,This is a great dress for summer and very flattering i am and could have pulled off the regular length but chose to go with the petite so that i could wear flats,1
3557,I bought two of these in red and taupe this is a great sweater for those of us who cant wear wool but need to stay warm the cowl is adjustable with buttons so not overwhelming even on a small person such as myself the texture is yummy and so are the colors softness factor is over the top too i wish it came in black have not washed them yet so cant attest to that feature but i am very happy with the quality so far thanks retailer,1
3558,Omg i just received this dress and it is absolutely gorgeous fits me like a glove lovely rich reds and quality for reference im and lb and the petite was perfect i could have even gone with the regular if its within your means i highly recommend d,1
3559,Fits very strange odd cut does not look well on,0
3560,Adore these jeans great length cute cuffed details could do cartwheels in these,1
3561,Absolutely love this jacket i convinced my girlfriend to get one too we could not be more pleased slightly oversized throughout the body this is true no matter the size you buy with great contrasting sleeves and back the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist perfect springsummer weight can be worn with a sweatersweatshirt underneath its a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeanschinos perfect for mus,1
3562,Gorgeous top and generous to fuller figures i meant to order an xl but somehow ended up with the l was positive id have to return it but it was perfect went back and bought the white its one of those wonderful pieces that feels classy and fun at the same time very flattering fit,1
3563,Love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season,1
3564,This shirt is so very pretty in person the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy making it more unique than your usual flowy tshirt it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy you can wear it casual or dress it up i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly,1
3565,Such a pretty little sweater gorgeous detail i wish it were a bit longer it was too boxy for my large chest otherwise it fits tts i wanted to lie inside of it and take a nap so comfortable please make more sweaters in this knit,1
3566,This blouse is so much cuter in person and its more golden than yellow so its not as bright which makes it easier for blondes to wear i tried it on thinking id never be able to pull the color off but loved it enough to try and wow so perfect i had to get it and it was on sale love this and happy to add it to my antro collection,1
3567,I bought this online this looked like a sweater that was accidentally shrunk in the dryer when i received iti will be returning this,0
3568,This dress is breathtaking it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels can be dressed up or down with jewelry heels,1
3569,I havent taken this off since i got it and since then ive ordered two more colors its definitely sheer but the blue isnt seethrough though i expect the lighter colors are it is a distressed look but supersoft comfy and perfect to wear over work out clothes or dressed up with jeans really a nice summer top for hot days im the and the xxs is perfectdrapey but not baggy very flattering straps too,1
3570,This dress makes you feel like a little kid it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress for sure i wish it had a little more definition to the waistit just barely works for larger chested women definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that its hard to pass this one up its just too beautiful i recommend it but its probably not for everyone,1
3571,I wanted to love this blouse but the peplum came too high up on my waist i have a short torso and im busty so the placement of the peplum just didnt work for me it is a very pretty color and fit fine in my normal size but the peplum just didnt work on my short torso i think this would be a very pretty blouse for people with a different body type than mine,1
3572,This tunic is beautiful the color is a vibrant blue i can wear it with jeans or dress it up with my white linen capris i ordered the small and it fits me perfectly,1
3573,I love the color of this top but the style is not flattering i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide bummer,0
3574,This top is absolutely gorgeous in person i am usually a size in everythingpants and tops but this one i ended up getting a size definitely size down otherwise the top will slide back on you and the arm holes will be crazy big but its a great top for summer very cool and light and the vneck back and front is just so pretty great buy,1
3575,I think these jeans are amazing they are very flattering and most of all comfortable i often will go up a size when buying white but i didnt have to with these they also relax very nicely as you wear them buying white jeans has always been a challenge often they are to thin and not that flattering i dont feel the same about these they are the perfect summer white jean i think i need another pair,1
3576,I agree with other reviews this is perfect to throw on for running errands or just hanging out at home super soft and comfy got the blue and now want the grey,1
3577,I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was off i ordered a size m petite sadly when it arrived and i tried it on it was very boxy stiff like and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back,0
3578,I purchased this dress in the navy and white stripe i did purchase the petite since im and it worked out great very nice style comfy and flattering looks great with a pair of boots one of my go to dresses for sure,1
3579,This is the rare metallic that doesnt itch really well made italy lightweight its a total goi usually wear a large but i bought a medium i tried it on in the dressing room i think it looks better fit than oversized preppy i wear a b bra size,1
3580,I got these on sale a few months ago they are the most comfortable jeans ive ever owned im and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long,1
3581,I bought this dress on sale and it is perfect i wish that i wouldve invested sooner and picked it up in a number of different colors the cut is amazing and the cutout on the back is sexy without exposing too much skin,1
3582,A couple of months ago i bought the white in this top in my usual size small its cute flowy like to wear it with ankle or capri leggings have worn with shorts as well casual cute plus i love cotton anyways think ill go ahead with the other colors since the heat will be arriving soon,1
3583,Love love love this tunic i was worried about getting the regular size because they dont have my size in petite anymore but im glad i took a chance getting the regular size my daughter said its just perfect on me very pretty,1
3584,I bought in white great for a lightweight cover up well made and cozy,1
3585,I read the cleaning instructions label carefully followed them closely and still the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes pied me off just after the first wash and even before wearing them i have streaks of uneven color on the pants bad quality material or dye is what causes this now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes thanks a lot retailer,0
3586,This is the kind of blouse you want at your reach when dressing on a humid day cotton enhanced with beautiful detail a very classic timeless ageless piece i bought the medium which fits perfectly size top f my only ding is that the neck opening should be stitched less deep there is a gap funny thing is that in the photo the models blouse is pinned exactly where im talking about i didnt take off a star because i had a dressmaker fix the problem but this was annoying i wore,1
3587,Really cute sweater well made but so intensely itchy i couldnt keep it on for more than seconds,0
3588,This jacket is very well made the denim is quality and very soft the other fabric isnt as heavy as the denim but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams on the interior the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too handy for your phone fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be love it,1
3589,Beautiful piece very well made and drapes well i love it runs a little big id go a size smaller,1
3590,I love this top i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more i can pair it with blue jeans my pink pilcro chinos and even my turquoise pilcro shorts i love that this tee doesnt have the rolled sleeves so its a little more finished looking i tried on both the small and medium and both fit but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that for reference im lbs d chest i do think is hefty for a tshirt so you could roll the,1
3591,I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product label says that you can wash and dry normally however upon washing the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not the robe will now not lay flat the fabric pulls at the edges and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut extremely disappointed for a garment i expected much more i wish i could return this,0
3592,Great tank top loved it so much that i ordered,1
3593,This top reminds me of something out of the s it is super comfortable and just makes a very clean look,1
3594,I love white shirts and can never have enough in my closet this one is gorgeous and is way prettier in person than it looks on the model it has a peplum bottom with sort of but not quiteappliqud large polka dots all over it is a pullover so there are no buttons on the peplum i normally wear xl in retailer tops unless they run very large i tried on the large in the store and it fit but i knew if it shrank when i washed it id never be able to wear it again i ordered the xl which came tod,1
3595,This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased as a tall woman its hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs this dress is classic comfortable and truly flattering i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being seethrough i cant get enough of this styleill be buying it in black tooooopss,1
3596,I ordered this online with out previously trying it on and it fit nicely just love the colors draping and material nice and light good spring or fall dress i wore it with black flats but it would look great with booties too very flattering i received a ton of compliments,1
3597,This blouse is just so beautiful but i do love white blouses so that may influence my enthusiasm however once i buttoned it up it was just dreamy i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs so its often hard to find something thats the right length this is perfect it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height but its a rare find for me paired with a pair of cropped pants because id come in a dress it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways im sti,1
3598,Great top i bought it for my daughter and it is well made and the fabric is very nice she is and it reaches just the top of her jeans,1
3599,I got this in the dark coral color it is lovely im taking it to hawaii,1
3600,I purchased this in the red really more of a brick color and wore it so much that i went back to get it in black too i received a ton of compliments when i wore it the fabric is a nice weight and it hangs beaufully looks great over skinny jeans or leggings i plan on wearing it year round,1
3601,I absoluty love this dress it hugs in all the right places giving a sexy yet very classy look very much a mad men look the quality is fantastic and could easily pass for a vintage dress that has been kept safely preserved i would recomend every lady has one of these in her closet especially when you need to feel just a little bit prettier,1
3602,These are the best jeans ever never wore pilcros before and only ordered them because they were on sale so glad i did now im hooked,1
3603,Lovely foxy sweater i dressed it down for work but would look fantastic with a pretty skirt too,1
3604,I had no issues with size or length im c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a and the umbrella print in a the was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami i could have worn a in the striped top as well i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size dropped a little so there was plenty of room these shirts are adorable i usually dont like button downs but this style is very flattering the material is light and drapes w,1
3605,Soft silky lined in silky natural fabric hangs great without being weighty extremely flattering on my xl short body im petite but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes so they go just a hint over my kneesexactly what i need lovely details sequins and weighted tassels highly recommend,1
3606,I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friends wedding the colors looked perfect the cut was great etc very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person and sad that the slit came right to my knee which is a really weird height sadly returning might purchase again if it goes on sale and i cant find anything better before the wedding,0
3607,Very comfortable im so i ordered the petite and its a perfect length no need to roll up slightly slim fit but not overly tight typically order everything online and didnt need to return ordered charcoal color which is simply a faded blackdark grey,1
3608,I saw this in the store and wanted to try it but couldnt justify buying another denim shirt at this price then it went on sale as others said this does run a bit small though the chestshoulders so i sized up one size its still slightly fitted but my broad shoulders are used to that i was afraid that the pleats would give a maternity look although my chest size is not that large b it doesnt do that on me its loose but not overly sokinda like the current swing top trend the,1
3609,Loved the material and the style unfortunately my fears came true when i received this swimsuit and there wasnt enough support despite a review i had read as a d i thought the halter would be enough support however the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely i am sad i wont be keeping this though the material is heavenly,0
3610,Gorgeous toptunic runs true to size i paired it with jeans but i love the look of the white pants in the picture beautiful and flows nicely,1
3611,This is a very sexy skirt very slimminga great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe dress it up or downthe slits are high so you are exposed like a short shirt,1
3612,Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls great quality material,0
3613,I love this blouse it looks great under a blazer dressed up and great with boyfriend jeansit is loose and flowy the neck line is low i bought a medium and it is a little large but fits with the style of the topi happen to love the fabric it is soft and feels great on the skin one of my favorite fabric combinations is rayon viscose and cotton,1
3614,This dress is very pretty in person and perfect for warm and hot weather the material is comfy and breathable and the length is perfect for reference i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses and ordered this in a medium as well at that size it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist so i would say it fits true to size for me but w,1
3615,These are so comfy i will wear them for seasons so worth it especially on sale,1
3616,I love this dress its the right length and its very soft and comfortable it is not really denim just a soft grey material i tried on the blue one in the store before ordering the grey and found that the small fit better than the medium im typically a medium usually in this brand i have to size up but in this case i sized down i highly recommend this dress is you are looking for a simple shift dress that you can just throw on and go,1
3617,Tried the xs in store and lbs dd fit like a glove the chest part was fitted on me the white is almost not see through but nowadays that seems acceptable see though the material is typical of meadow rue cotton like and airy it is a basic white with styling the top part also has some dimension i overall thought this would look nice with my white shorts or with some nice jeans and blazer,1
3618,Tla has another winner in my book i decided on the blue and thrilled with the tee its a soft blue almost light periwinkle fabric isnt so thin so it not see through thank goodness i actually love it so much im ordering the other color as well i absolutely would recommend this cute tee love love tla,1
3619,So soft and comfy looks equally good buttoned as open can be worn as a tunic top over leggings or jeans the charcoal color is chic and i liked the different patterns on back and front,1
3620,Wanted to love this colorful romper the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking no way would i wear this,0
3621,I love this shirt its different than other summer tops its pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size and runs true to size on a windy day the front will come open but only to your stomach,1
3622,Wore for the th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle,1
3623,These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeansi loved the higher rise because they dont feel like theyre will fall off like many low cut jeans dothe material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever ownedlove the braided styling around the pocketsthe bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok,1
3624,First problemi would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not secondly it has a really funky cheap unfinished rawhemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress the keyhole in the front is super longagain does not seem to fit the dress i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts length is just above knee i am lbs d and the six was a good fit sending this home t,0
3625,This romper is one of my favorite purchases the material is great the fit is very forgiving and it is very comfortable it is easily dressed up or down i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well,1
3626,I love this shirt i received many compliments on it when i wore it to work with a skirt,1
3627,I am a brand loyal ag fan best washes best pocket placement and these are no exception they do run a little big i usually wear a or in the stilts depending on the fabric content i tried these in the and both fit but i went with the because these will stretch at least size the distressing is the right amount however i gave stars because one area is directly over the knee which i dont care for solved it by having a seamstress reinforce the back of it with a similar,1
3628,This dress looks way better than pictured online it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items ive purchased before and lays great i purchased a size small i am lbs and thought it was true to size i cant wait to wear this warm weather sandals and a tote for running errands,1
3629,It fits perfectly slim but not clingy and it has a beautiful patterntexture to it its surprisingly warm for how thin it is and its a great layering piece,1
3630,I ordered this on the black friday sale one reviewer mentions that the fabric is thin and i ordered it anyway because the design was unique besides i have another bailey dress and felt that i knew what to expect on quality when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised while not thick the fabric is a better quality than my other dress plus the style is unique and flattering i am and it hits inches above my knee i will definitely wear it to work with knee boots,1
3631,I love pjs and other assorted lounging pieces and this one is exceptional in fact i plan to buy the pj bottoms made with the same fabric i tried them both on in the store and ultimately decided on the chemise because it is very specialthe fit is tts fyi c short waist broad shoulders i normally wear a ml in a chemise and i chose a m in this one there is plenty of room but it is more fitted to my shape as a chemise should be the piece shows curves without showing bumps,1
3632,Just received my second pair of pilcro in the red i loved the color and needed a back up pair perfect fabric for year round wear length is great for my height love every pair i own this is my th pair love love them,1
3633,Picked this up end of season sale but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it it runs a bit large im usually between a s and m at retailer and im a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose its definitely not a soft flowy t mix of tshirt material and linen the main part of the t is cotto,1
3634,I bought these in pink and added taupe to my wardrobe because one pair is not enough i found a tiny variation in size between my two pairs but for the most part they are true to size i love the just below the navel rise they pair well with strappy or fringe sandals i havent worn them with boots yet however i think theyll be great since they hug in close to the calf and ankle without being tight buy them in the size you buy jeans or one waist size smaller if youre sometimes this or some,1
3635,I just received this and absolutely love it i love cold shoulder designs and this one is unique and so well made i am usually a size small and it fit perfectly i would say it runs true to size and will look perfect with white or black pants and a cute sandal i am so glad i got it love the quality,1
3636,The dress looks better than the pictures online it also arrives quite quickly after i placed my order i am about lbs and p fits me perfectly the embroidery is so radiant in multiple colors against the navy blue dress i am very please with this purchase,1
3637,Love this cardigan ive been searching for a comfortable lounge type of sweater and this is perfect the sleeves are a bit tighter than the body but i would wear it over a tank top so it is comfortable i am lb and and i ordered my usual m,1
3638,I wanted to like this coat so bad i loved the bright red color and design but when i received it it seemed very cheap and just too large i returned it,0
3639,Very happy with this top love the designvery different also like that the front panel is different fabric buttons also are a fun detail great shirt to transition from summer to fall i usually wear xs or sordered this in xs and perfect fit going to be a favorite,1
3640,So this is a pricey tee but i ordered it on salestill pricey im really surprised how much i ended up loving it and wearing it ordered it in the light red size xs and it has become my go to tank for the summeri wear it every week the armholes are a tab long on me so i wear a black sports bra underneath and it does peak through but not in a tacky way if you dont mind the price i would pick this up,1
3641,Love this topthat simple,1
3642,The print and style of this dress is pure s so fun the black and white is especially striking normally i would wait a bit until the weather warmed up a bit more but this dress is so cute and flattering i just couldnt wait the outer layer is actually sort of an open mesh its not extremely delicate but could snag if youre not a bit careful however its the fabric that really makes it stand out so its well worth it id say the fit is true to size except if youre busty i normally,1
3643,I got this planning to wear to a wedding but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony ive definitely gotten some mileage out of it like the other reviews said it is long but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges love it,1
3644,Loved these in the store but the was sold out everywhere and i noticed the fabric was very stretchy i bought the petite online and was worried about the length they fit great im,1
3645,I love this shirt very comfortable and has a nice drape i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest so i returned for the next size upvery well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath,1
3646,These pants fit great the velvet material is a sleek look these pants can be casual by day and are easily dressed up in the evening,1
3647,First off this runs very large im normally an and sized down to the but probably could have done a it looked like a tent on me the top part is lovely i just think the bottom is way to large and not flattering this one is definitely going back especially with all the white dress options they have out now,0
3648,Great winter maxi soft and comfortable fabric good quality stretchy but not too clingy fitted in all the right places and very flattering petite was unavailable so will need hemming,1
3649,I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly i love the simple yet girly look of this top the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch it looks even better in person than in the pictures the material is very soft and comfortable looks great with jeans and flats or boots,1
3650,I bought this as a swimsuit cover and it was exactly like the picture so soft very good quality fit perfectly definitely worth it for this price,1
3651,I love this dress it has pockets in front timeless fun dress up or down,1
3652,I expected this to be a pretty basic peasant top but was pleasantly surprised with all aspects of my purchase fabric is soft and flowing with a perfect feminine vibe it has a nice liner and the length and fit are perfect can be dressed up or down as you like it does run a bit large but its due to the style not the sizing i ordered my usual size and cannot be happier with it go aheadpress the button,1
3653,This is absolutely adorable and so flattering i have the patterned shirt and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much i am ft and lbs and the medium fits nicely hope this helps,1
3654,I am lbs got xs it was huge on me had to return it very trendy great quality unfortunate design not worth the money,0
3655,I had eyed this simple yet stylish dress for awhile but hadnt tried it on yet i managed to snag the orange version during the tag sale for maeve it is super flattering and will be a wardrobe staple for years,1
3656,I love these leggings the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex the fit is somewhere between leggings and skinny pants the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality the petite fit works perfectly for me as well no bunching at the ankles i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months,1
3657,Wore my new red cardigan for the first time today to work fit is tts this is a true red and not neon or orange tinted it wraps nicely in front and has a nice flair at the hips i also like the detail in the knit i like to push my sleeves up and love the fact that they dont slide down my arms all day ill wear this cardigan a lot,1
3658,Purchased this in the blue color in the store today honestly if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look it really is beautiful in person the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater it fits true to size i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed the sizing is perfect it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate,1
3659,I got this in a l and probably i am a m however the waist pretty much fit but the bodice was baggy in a really bizarre way i dont think a human could actually be shaped a way that would fit properly in this dress this dress is well suited for a woman with a very large bust but a small waist,0
3660,Like the other reviewer said its hard to get on and i had to size down like i often do at retailer but its so pretty and its not too short like most rompers we host thanksgiving every year and im so excited to find an alternative to a dresspants so i can work amp cook in style,1
3661,I agree with the other reviews runs small would have been perfect if it actually was comfortable waistband doesnt stretch all the way around bummer,0
3662,This is a gorgeous dress the print is beautiful and unique however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames i would definitely recommend sizing down,1
3663,These jeans are soooo soft fit is great and the wash is a unique inky grayish color perfect for fall love,1
3664,This is a great pair of trousers for work but can also be dressed down they are very flattering and runs true to size theyre also a bit highwaisted which i love my only complaint is that they are unlined im not sure why a nice pair of wool trousers would be unlined however im still giving them stars because the fit and quality outweigh the one con,1
3665,I ordered this dress on a whim because of the lush colors and the sale price to my amazement it has become one of my goto dresses it is far more handsome and flattering in person i ordered a m for my and c frame and the fit is perfect contrary to how the back of the dress is shown on the model the back is not straight but flows whimsically thereby adding to its famine appeal at this price its a nobrainier purchase,1
3666,I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popbackthis dress is killer its casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan its body skimming but lined so it doesnt cling to flaws the knit itself is substantial and its a mockneck not a turtleneck i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large because of weight and lining this is a spring and early fall dress,1
3667,This is a beautiful skirt and such a great piece to collect from erin fetherstonthe design and cut are very flattering on a variety of body types i have more of a curvy shape and love this type of cut to accentuate my smaller waste rather than fitted dressesskirts that hugthere are several linings that help give shape and volume the stripes are made of ribbon its so gorgeous ive received many compliments ive paired with a sequin tank and glitter keds by kate spadeits a dynam,1
3668,Was excited to receive this dress as i got it at a great price on sale the colors are great and it fits pretty good but it came without a slip so disappointing to not receive the entire dress hence the stars may send it back for this reason,0
3669,I originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it so i bought a second one in the neutral color they both fit perfectly and are very flattering i love how i can dress them up or down i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy i also wear them to work i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days when im used to wearing scrubs i hate wearing true dress clothes these dresses are a happy medium i only wish my size was available in the t,1
3670,Very comfortable super cute my husband says its the cutest bathing suit ive ever owned and ive owned a lot,1
3671,Sadly this has to go back i am lbs and this shirt is super short on me very short and its so wide its almost a trapeze cut the overall effect is ss style maternity shirt which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful the detail is nice in person even the sleeve cuffs are great i am not very tall and im fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles loose and tight the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering,0
3672,I saw this in the store and wanted to try it on but ran out of time a week or so ago i thought i would need petite but surprise it does not come in petiteso i started obsxessing that i had to try it on whcich i did yesterday mistake because i love it and even if it is not peite it workedc with heels and online it already says only a few left so my size will not make it to sale so i bought it full pricecut is very flattering and colors are great also can be worn any seas,1
3673,This is a stunning flattering welldesigned and sized magnificent and yet wearable comfortable summer blouse i am a busty f size and this lovely piece makes me look amazing i most highly recommend to any woman the cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of give i experienced no pulling at the chest or back which can happen for me the bottom of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top so you may not need a cami the combination of leaf printcrochet,1
3674,It is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day,1
3675,This is a treasure and must buy friends tiny designs the most amazing blouses and shirts and i feel stoked to have gotten this one the level of detailed embroidery on the front and tiny silver and gold sequins on silver net lace at the shoulders is artistic and welldesigned ive always found the tiny brand to be predictably one size small but when i get past my ego and order one size up to a large i am sooooo satisfied this sartorial work of art is completely lovely i have a busty f,1
3676,I absolutely love these pants they are my new favorite thank you,1
3677,This super cute sweater is comfy and fun to wear i love it as much as last years wool paned sweater tunic except this sweater is too short on me to wear as a dress wonderful with leggings and boots i bought the blue in size m regular and my stats are tcwhi tallchestwaisthipsinseam,1
3678,I had loved this online when i saw the pretty floral pattern however in person it is such a disappointment the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor,0
3679,I ordered the petite size and the fit is just like on the modelnot tight at all and very flattering even the petite length is long on me and i will need to wear wedges or something with a heel but honestly that makes them even more flatteringmakes my legs look long i am and about the material is so soft and substantialthe color is very accurately portrayed online i cant wait to wear this fall,1
3680,I purchased this dress in black and love it its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid it was perfect considering ordering it in another color,1
3681,Love this dress i agree with some of the other reviewers the arm holes are a little low but not a deal breaker im lbs and ordered the xs and it fits perfect would definitely recommend,1
3682,I am obsessed with this dress i wore it on new years eve i felt stunning in it i cant wait to wear it again as soon as possiblevery good quality my regular size fit me but i cannot gain not even a pound more im lb im between slender and curvy,1
3683,I just received them blue and wore them today i got so many compliments they are comfy and very flattering i would not call the fabric cheap at all it is super soft and washes and wears nicely i ordered the medium and they fit perfectly even though i am on the large side of medium im ordering the other color right now,1
3684,I love this brand and their different styles of tshirts extremely soft washes well and wears well the shirt runs a bit large and i usually wear a medium but in this brand i am a extra small or small,1
3685,There was nothing i liked about this coat it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on i usually like oranges too but even this color turned me off,0
3686,This shirt looks and feels fabulous i got black and white and received a ton of compliments wore with boots and leggings and fun jewelry,1
3687,This shirt fits great it is a fun look i wore it wear a pair of leggings and sneakers for a casual day look it goes down to my knees in the back and the front is asymmetric so cute i think i will get a lot of use out of this going forward,1
3688,Although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me love the material style just doesnt look right on me,1
3689,Ladies this top shrinks i am very disappointed i was in love with this top and the first time i washed it it shrunk a significant amount i did not use a dryer i laid this piece out to dry as i do with the majority of my knit tops and it shrunk it is a lot shorter and much tighter especially in my arms if you love this top i might suggest buying a size up and washing it to fit,0
3690,I like this sweater i bought it in small and medium because it was off and i didnt want my size to sell out im keeping the small im and lbs and hourglass the medium was way too much fabric its still roomy in the small but its lush looking and soft and will look pretty with jeans and high boots i ordered the one in the beige as well but i think the lavender color is prettier in person i think the beige may wash me out hope this helps,1
3691,Love the pattern i thought i would be hosed and need a petite but the regular xs fits nicely it is on the thiner side so great for summer office is coooldlove subtle squares glad they still had my size at sale,1
3692,This dress was not what i had hoped from the online pictures i had high hopes but the fit was really wonky and the material seemed cheap the arm holes were too big and made the dress seem more like a bathing suit cover up than a classy summer dress needless to say its going back,0
3693,A truly unwearable slip scratchy fabric bunchy skirt teeny bodice it feels like you are wearing wrapping paperthe foil kind,0
3694,Love the fabric that c s usesso very soft and pliable fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open but the highlow hem is far more extreme than the new action shots show im kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress im d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length,1
3695,Love this top super soft and drapes great even after washing it is pretty long and loose but it is so comfy and cute to wear with jeans or even joggers,1
3696,This coat is really beautiful and pictures dont do it justice it runs very large im normally an xl or l in sweaters but because of the balloony shape i actually took a medium even then it looks like im being enveloped so i prefer to wear it unsnapped,1
3697,I love this top the color and the embroidery are beautiful and unique i love the soft cotton arms and back wish there were more colors,1
3698,Love these pilcro jeans my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs they are not supposed to be leggings they did not stretch out too much all day slightly in the waist not enough to size down the dark color is perfect for winter they are very comfortable love pilcro jeans,1
3699,This is a perfect change of seasons into cooler colder months piece colors the colors are muted the pattern is modern and stylish the cut flattering sizingthe sizing is generous and fit is easy love length which is true to the product photo fitting at about the bottom of my fingertips i love the coverage without looking too coveredquality its soft a great weight and the quality seems good i have already worn it a few times and it is not one of those sweaters,1
3700,im tall lbs and d and a solid size the size fit me perfectly but if it shrank it would be too tight across the bust the size also fit me well but was an inch looser all around the darts on the hit me in exactly the right place so i decided to go with the even though it looks a little big it makes me look smaller the fabric is a soft ivory color and the fabric is soft but thick its not see through at all the lace on the sides a,1
3701,Bought the blue romper and love it to bits definitely a summer staple im lbs and generally consider myself proportioned but curvy on the bottom and the xs fit perfectly many rompers have really short inseams but this one is a relatively conservative so i feel comfortable and can dress it up or down ive worn it a few times and received tons of compliments its super comfortable forgiving and flattering i originally purchased it in black in pxs and ps because at the ti,1
3702,So soft such beautiful fabric it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured one of my favorite retailer purchases to date,1
3703,I love this piece theyre calling it a tunic but its plenty long enough to wear without any pants i usually wear a smallxsmall in retailer sizes and i definitely went with the xsmall size down to avoid the potato sack look i think this piece is so great for fall definitely a must buy,1
3704,Purchased as a gift for someone who needs to up her pj ante soft cute fun,1
3705,It was hard for me to pay full price for basic white buttondown but i am so glad i did the highlow and split back detail give the shirt a unique look it looks cute with jeans and wedges as a dressed down option i bought this to go with the shoreline skirt and it looked really good together this is a staple that can be worn multiple times and for many years,1
3706,This jacket is exactly what i was looking for it is a lightweight and comfortable material that will be perfect for fallspring and for layering during a mild winter i am lbs and generally wear a small but i ordered a medium in this jacket and am happy i sized up the jacket is roomy but the cinched waist makes it flattering rather than shapeless id definitely recommend this anorak to anyone,1
3707,I saw this in the store not on sale and loved it was so happy when it went on sale it is beautifully made and is soft and cozy,1
3708,This is baby soft and a great basic i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if youre not going to wear it as a layer the black color is saturated in a good way its also very long but im short so this would be perfect for taller frames,1
3709,This top is absolutely gorgeous but i followed the care tag to a t and it completely fell apart in the wash will be returning,0
3710,I had been looking at the dresses and jumpsuits from this designer for a while and decided to order this jumpsuit im usually an extra small in jumpsuits and wasnt sure to get the petite or petite im and about lbs and the petite is perfect in the legs and waist but a little wide across the chest im a c the material is soft and feels very nice and like good quality its perfect for dressing up a little in the summer and im going to think of ways to transition it to the f,1
3711,I stumbled upon this dress yesterday at the store and fell in love with it i wore it today with boots and received tons of compliments it is light comfortable and flattering i love that it is machine washable too,1
3712,Beautiful color emphasizes a small waist top is fitted so if youre curvy beware im a ddd and size skirt is roomy agree with other reviewer that zipper is not smooth reminds me a little of a prom dress i had in which could be good or bad,1
3713,Runs a little small but is very chic you can wear it with jeans and a white tshirt and you are going to look awesome,1
3714,Im lbs with a waist and hips i purchased a and the fit was perfect im just a bit short waisted have a rather small waist and often find that pants of any kind gap at the back these fit perfectly felt great on and i love the fabric,1
3715,Love this henely the laceup is cute the shirt is comfy so versatile beach coverup or over jeans,1
3716,There were just too many pleats to this thing it was not flattering it looks fantastic on this model but not on me oh well,0
3717,I bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer its perfect being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin i love all shades of green and this green dress is no exception the color is lovely and eyecatching and cool as to the sizing i usually wear a size but to make sure due to the design i ordered an and a there wasnt a great difference between the two dresses but the size top was a bit more fitted and looked bet,1
3718,Ive had my eye on this cute knit top for awhile and when there was a sale i picked up both colors they fit me like they do the model a little loose and swingy but not overly so the colors look spoton like the picture i am rather top heavy dd but with the colors being darker on the top portion i feel like this works without accentuating my bust too much i am and weigh the medium worked out great the knit is soft and it appears to be made well the only drawback is a rough,1
3719,These are the perfect combination of comfort and beauty i highly recommend,1
3720,This dress has pretty colors the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella it has enough material to make skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways the photo of model is from side not the front very unflattering on me,0
3721,I love workout dresses and skirts i sport them in both yoga if they have an under layer of shorts obviously and in high cardio classesas well as for things like tennis i like the extra breeze a dressskirt will get you and find them to be really comfortable i really like this dress as it is not a super bold color it is hard to find workout attire that is not neon colored i prefer things to be a little more relaxed and less look at me like when i am working out this dress is flatter,1
3722,What a beautiful comfortable material and the colors are stunning im so disappointed at the unflattering cut it fits like a shapeless tent even the arm holes have big gaps that arent snug i am lbs and ordered the xxs petite,0
3723,The cream color in this dress is divine such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest jacket or alone it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color because its a knit can go smaller in size i tried on both the xsmall and small opted to go with the xsmall found it fit better,1
3724,This is a great basic shirt it has room in the midsection so you can tuck in or not it is also extremely soft i am a and the m fit just right,1
3725,This dress is as flattering as wrap dresses usually are the xsmall fits well dress probably runs a tiny bit large as i go between a small and extra small though i did move the tiny snap at the neckline down as it fastened too high for me the dress did snag slightly in one spot but overall it is really very flowing and lovely on with unusual colors that look nice with late summer tan and gold earrings,1
3726,Love this top has a beautiful shape and it wasnt too long on my frame puella always makes items with lovely soft cotton and this is no exception awesome piece for summer,1
3727,I love this vestit is a work of art in its design and construction but extremely wearable absolutely gorgeous on and perfectly warm and functional my favorite thing ive ever bought at retailer,1
3728,Love this dress its exactly as pictured and the fabric design is so pretty will look great with a cardigan for fall but also will look nice for summer with the cutout in the back nice too that it has a detachable slip,1
3729,The button fell off when i took it out of the bag and i noticed that all of the thread had unraveled will be returning,0
3730,This dress may not be worth the full price of but on sale it is one huge bargain so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering seriously i dont know why its not sold out at this price it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress sack like found this tts looks great with pumps or flats,1
3731,First thanks retailer for not putting itchy wool or fur in this its so soft gorgeous bias for is super flattering for those of us with less than perfect bodies for reference im dd size xss was perfect,1
3732,I love this dress it fits like a dream and is incredibly flattering i vary between a and a in dresses and the was too large on the bust but the fit great the dress is longer than in the picture the model must be wearing heels but it doesnt quite hit the ground with flats the fabric is light and airy it comes across a little more formal in person but is versatile enough to be worn more casually as well,1
3733,I was doubtful when i first tried this on the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well more so in dresses than tops also it looks cute but not great on the hanger this a musttryon dress its just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity but also feel easy to wear the print and cut are flattering it has pockets also the length is nice close to knee length the fabric is good quality doesnt wrinkle easily im surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr,1
3734,This sweater is so lovely i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey very soft and comfortable the back doesnt wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone very flattering i highly recommend it,1
3735,I just received this in the mail and i was so surprised how flattering it is i ordered the print and i can see wearing this to work out with friends or for date night perfect summer tank comfortable and flattering a great addition to my wardrobe it fit true to size for me,1
3736,Well made dress but too much fabric for my taste it lays a little heavy on the body does not give a slimming affect the colors are vibrant pretty but the dress is too long as well as other reviewers have said the front is too low cut but turn it around and it looks feels better didnt work for me sadly ill be returning it,0
3737,I love this shirt i have it in red i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace you cant go wrong with a cute shirt that is soft i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming,1
3738,Best jeans fit is amazing buy them you wont regret it,1
3739,I saw this shirt on a friend and had to buy it right away it has the comfort of a regular tee but the frills at the bottom give it that retailer look true to size,1
3740,The neckline is very tight and itchy the arm holes are deeply cut the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture its shortwaisted its too bad because the embroidery is very pretty,0
3741,On a hot summer degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress great dress and such a wonderful fittoo bad its unwearable now,0
3742,Love love this skirt such a pretty green color and a great quality this will be a staple in my closet for years to come and i love a skirt with pockets,1
3743,I expected this dress to be pretty but was happily surprised at the level of beautiful detail its hard to tell in the pictures but the dress has a black background with tan embroidery all over and white embroidered eyelets the full lining is bright blue and it peeks through the eyelets with the slit on the back and the inside of the neckline lined in bright orange the slit on the back has two buttons closing it a really cute detail it fit me comfortably i am and got the si,1
3744,I agree with the other reviewer that the belted part definitely gives some great definition for those with a defined waist and that its a much lovelier color in person but thats about it for me thoughts belowpros tts i ordered the medium for my c frame and found it sufficient the color is much nicer in person as the other reviewer mentioned its a richer brown think mocha latte in terms of color the belt really helps tie it all together and keep it,0
3745,This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack living in la its degrees one day and the next the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate it runs true to size and is very comfy thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner,1
3746,When i tell people i invested in a horse sweater i dont get a lot of encouraging comments but when they see it they understand so cute different and cozy for cold days winter is long where i live really works as both a sweater and as a coat,1
3747,I ordered this dress online in p in the orange color the length was perfect but the dress seemed big it was a lot of dress so i went into the store and tried on a regular but the dress was a little long they didnt have petite in stock so they had it shipped to me and it fit perfectly i am and pounds i dont think this dress would work if you have a big bust im a b so it fits nicely around the chest area the length of the dress was also perfect,1
3748,I purchased this top at my local store this past weekend and i have to say i already know it will become an easy goto top it does run large so consider that when choosing what size to order i generally wear a medium but purchased a small in this top,1
3749,This dress looks better when wearing i am regular size s or cup d and fits perfect length and width in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily i wish the slip is the same length as the dress i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric i hope it helps,1
3750,I love this shirt i got the one with the skiiers for reference i got a size and im pounds its a bit tight around my shoulders but not enough to make me want a size if you have broader shoulders a would probably be good the bottom flares out a little and is cut shorter than other button downs its too short to really tuck in comfortably the print is absolutely perfect the shirt is soft and very flattering its pricey but super cute,1
3751,Just ordered this in a small for me size and medium for my mom size and it is gorgeous beautifully draped all the weightwarmth ill need for houston fall and winter looks polished snapped or unsnapped ageappropriate for both my mom s and myself s will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings we ordered the gray which is true to the photos,1
3752,I love this top so much the fit is super flattering and forgiving in the tummy areawin,1
3753,Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts and are thick enough to keep you warm and arent as thin as some tights normally are,1
3754,This arrived today and i am thrilled with it the material is soft but not at all clingy it drapes perfectly falling just above the knee there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself what a find,1
3755,I just saw this in the store and had to pick it up i just love this green color and can imagine it going with a number of different types of topsdresses i personally think this looks best with a chambray button down shirt with this vest over it paired with slim fitting black pants and boots,1
3756,The neckline is beautiful whether pulled forward or slipping back the pure merino knit is very fine with the two front panels cut on the bias raglan sleeves with high armholes it is a tiny bit itchy and normally im not too sensitive but that may improve with a handwash in eucalan or something similarfit for size xs on currently d or c bra with narrow shoulders and torsosnug at the shoulders but as it is a pure merino knit it does stretch the front length just,1
3757,I fell in love with this cute top however after reading reviews i am going to return it seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions who wants to dry clean a tank top not me sadly too bad style was cute and color was awesome,0
3758,Bought the green in the store wore them every week for weeks so i bought the bronze color too i usually wear a in pilcro because they do give a little during the day i had to go up to the because the thighs were a little too snug for me theres a zipper at the ankle so getting you foot through isnt a problem the fabric is sturdy it almost feels like a brushed cotton soft to the touch they zip up the side so are very slimming im for reference,1
3759,I went to my local retailer store on saturday to pick up some new cute things that i had my eye onafter collecting the items i came in for i saw this romper i tried it on and it was amazing comfortable soft and so versatile bonus i left so tremendously happy it will be a win for many years to come,1
3760,This shirt aesthetically is very pleasing i love the overall design and colors however when i tried it on i was immediately itchy the material is not soft like a cozy sweater ought to be in addition though i ordered a size medium it fit very large almost too oversized the sleeves were extremely long on me and the overall body was too big its too bad i really loved the look but im not the type to layer if you are go for it but get a size smaller than you normally would,0
3761,Im so short that this could be a dress runs a little big but very forgiving the green color is so vibrant love love love,1
3762,This dress is beautiful i am on the short side so i ordered in regular and petite and due to the length the petite is better the material is soft and comfortable to wear,1
3763,I like this dress the floral pattern and little red beads others may think it is baggy however i like this type of the style,1
3764,I very rarely buy at full price but had to have this on and it is worth it i sized down and fits great tons of compliments,1
3765,I loved this shirt online but when it came to my house i loved it even more super comfy and really flattering i love it runs true to size,1
3766,Loved this skirt it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer,1
3767,I love this dress i bought the blue one and i love the designs i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant it flows nicely and is super comfortable,1
3768,Love this top the cut is nice and is similar to the previous one that was denim love hte colors but they looked awful on my skin tone unfortunatelysizing is true to size i tried on the regular size not petite and it was fine my usual or went with as tjhis top is a looser fit would be boxy the lace part is a nice added detial the plaid is soft flannel color is a salmon colr with navy but the dominant color washed me out i am fair love it otherwise,1
3769,This tank is so light and made with great fabric i bought this to wear over pants black jeans classic denim this fall maybe with a jacket over i purchased a size medium and it is loose and comfortable,1
3770,This top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe it looks great with jeansjean shorts its relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well,1
3771,I love this shirt lightweight and versatile perfect for all seasons,1
3772,I cant stop wearing this its perfect for layering the fit is greatloose but not a bag i love that its a wide open knit,1
3773,This dress is beautiful i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress in my mind it takes me back to the s and s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early th century the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls,1
3774,I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems i am little and and i dont think its too boxy at all i like the way it hangs and ill say i like it much more in person than on the model its somehow cozier than it looks in the picture its a real boosh that means comfy i wouldnt have picked it from the online pic but in person it really caught my eye,1
3775,Very long shirt i have to tuck it in i love the lipstick design and its great quality material its really soft and cotton breathable,1
3776,This fits a little short on me and ill have to wear a shirt underneath even with a high waist pant i still adore it get it for the price,1
3777,Beautiful and delicate,1
3778,Currently own this in colors after originally buying one im normally wear a medium bought a small in this best material and fit overall perfect length for long torso,1
3779,Soft fabric the blue is a nice color rich the drape effect is very flattering on the body the length of the regular xs was fine on me i often get petite but would not need it in this case could wear this with jeans or dress it up with a nice skirt good basic,1
3780,im tall lbs and d and the size l fit me perfectly i probably could have gotten into the m but i dont like my ts to pull under the armpits or across the bust and this top looks like it needs room to flow the white is very sheer but a nude bra wont show through the navy is not see through i love the asymmetric hem in the back im a little concerned that the raw edge on the hem wont hold up in the wash but i plan on hand washing these anyway bec,1
3781,The textured marled stripes on this top are so soft and give this pullover the edge it needs a few people have asked me where i bought this from and ive only worn it twice fits like the photo im lbs and bought the xs,1
3782,This is the best dress i received it last week and have already worn it three times perfect fit casual and so easy but the length and front details make it so fun thicker than many other tshirt dresses but light enough that i wasnt overly hot on super warm days def recommend,1
3783,I was a little wary of this top but decided to try anyway so glad i did the style is great and the fabric is lightweight and comfy i debated between the blue and the honey and ended up with the honey it is just so different yet such a nice neutral i am normally a size or maybe a large in tops and purchased this in size it definitely runs large for reference i am lbs dd not sure why another reviewer said this top isnt for large busts it was very flattering on me an,1
3784,These are great they fit tts im a in most denim brands thats the size i got the material has some give but doesnt stretch out the color is not super white so you can actually wear them in the colder weather season as well at they were a little longer on me than shown on the model i find them very comfortable,1
3785,This is one of the lowest quality shirts i have ever received from retailer i was so excited for the shirt it looked so pretty and soft in the pictures the flax is very scratchy marring the softness of the rest of the fabric the top half is totally sheer requiring a cami the shirt is cut in such a way that it flares out from the rib cafe in an unstructured way unnecessarily adding visual pounds finally the sewing is done very poorly and the the side tag is literally three inches longwh,0
3786,I liked this as soon as i saw it the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top the fir is good not too right or lose i took a size medium which was good for my lb frame the cotton was a plus for me also the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing i dont feel like i see myself all over town,1
3787,Ive returned multiple pairs of trousers this fall because they were low quality wrinkleprone wool and unlined the material on these however is high quality and weighty wearable in fall but also great for our much colder winters the herringbone is gorgeous dark grey and black with subtle flecks of red dark pink and gold they are also beautifully lined so will keep their shape and not itch true to size for cartonnier got a and tried a in the monica flannel trousers gorgeous,1
3788,This is such a beautiful top so flattering soft and comfortable it is great as a layering piece the colors are vibrant the blue is a gorgeous blue a deep cobalt blue i got one in every color,1
3789,Denim is a little heavier than my other pilcro stet jeans but i love the wash and the brokenin wear on the upper legs and pocket i mostly appreciate how little they stretch out during the day just enough to be comfortable but without losing their shape they seem a bit more fitted in the hips than the waist but i prefer jeans that arent tight in the waist so these are perfect for me i purchased the same size as all my other jeans and they fit just fine i am and the hem fell right,1
3790,This top is very gorgeous and chic it is very tight at the bottom but i feel like it will stretch a little over time it is also very long which i love because it can be rouched up to a great length if you are curvy both colors are great i bought both and love both the sizing was correct if you want it to fit like it does on the model shot if you want it a little more fitted size down but it may be very tight on the bottom all in all i love them and they are definitely a great find fo,1
3791,I was disappointed when i got this romper in the mail the picture looks much cuter than in person although its true to size it looks pretty baggy on also i thought the grey top and blue bottom were too similarly colored more contrast would have been nice im returning this item,0
3792,So soft warm and comfy the colors are absolutely beautiful and represented accurately in the photo i went with a small based on other reviews and while it fits it is slightly big i probably could have sized down for a more tailored look but i like the extra room and think it still drapes well without looking bulky for reference im lbs and mostly wear an xs in tops it does shed which is not a big deal to me but might be a deal breaker for others so i thought i woul,1
3793,This dress ran large on me i am a sometimes an but went with the it just hung on me giving me no shape the colors are pretty and the dress was nice but i expected it to wow me more for the price sending back may try again if the next size makes it to sale,1
3794,This dress is really flattering on fits true to size perfect length im dress hits just a few inches above my knees its simple yet versatile seasonally right now i plan to wear it with booties sandals in the spring,1
3795,Nice quality beautiful colors so nice i bought another as a gift,1
3796,I saw this on a mannequin in the store and so wanted it to work but was just too oversized and bulky very good quality and material,0
3797,Good dress to wear with heels flats tights versatille,1
3798,I ordered this only because it was in the stylists picks and decided to see what it was about i ordered a petite and dont regret it the petite on my falls right by te hips which is more flattering for a bomberstyle top not sure if descriptions says that but it is a bit bomberstyle the color is truly ivory not as white as hte picture depicts though now that i look colsely you do see a contrast with the white top the model is wearing so dont expect very white as mentione,1
3799,Im lbs i ordered a mediumregular the dress fell three inches above my knees this model is taller than i am and it falls to her kneesdoesnt make sense i think retailer sends petites in place of regular,0
3800,I am about lbs and the size regular fits me well sometimes i order petite but the regular fit me just right they are higher waisted than most pants i wear but they are completely adorable and comfortable to boot love the pattern the sturdy quality is tangible definitely going to order more of these pants in different patterns as they become available,1
3801,I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it the fabric is a great weight flowy but still substantial enough with nude undergarments i cant see anything in fact that is one of the things i love no special undergarments are required so it is very comfortable and still very flattering i typically wear a medium pounds b waist hip i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big i would have bought it but the salesperson suggested i try,1
3802,Im not sure what cup size i am b or c but the medium fits perfect material is soft and stretchy i usually wear a medium size shirt i definitely wont be wearing it out in public but i like it a lot for at home wear the matching underwear may run large im usually one size larger in bottoms than in tops but the medium worked for those too,1
3803,Was excited to receive this dress as it had some great reviews however of the love was coming from the set as a petite this didnt work well for me and the fabric flattened me out in the bust in an awkward way returned,0
3804,Extremely well made tank top great for work or a night out,1
3805,Very pretty color slightly darker than on my computer a bit like a light periwinklelavender embroidery is lovely and the dress has a fresh springlike quality the style is a basic shift but the color and details make up for the straight shape great dress for the springsummer months good quality and was a nice deal on sale,1
3806,I am kicking myself for listening to an earlier negative review and not ordering this dress months ago i finally took a chance on clearance and i love it the knit fabric is soft and beautiful so is the design and construction the fabric is very light and delicate all the details on the dress are just top notch the body of the dress is lined but the sleeves are not so theres a slight seethrough effect on the sleeves showing the lovely and delicate knit it fits like a dream and ive,1
3807,I have a couple of these tanks so i thought i would try the tshirt and its even more flattering than the tanks which i also love great material doesnt stretch out like you would think it would and looks great with shorts or pants,1
3808,Got the jacket in blue xs i am lbs fits great and wanted the beige one too however the beige color ones have a totally different fit the beige jackets run big and i was swimming in the xs hence the mixed reviews from other peeps,1
3809,This dress is just very unattractive it is quite shortwaisted almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place also it is very long midi length and the skirt is very wide the effect is matronly not cute at all sizewise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good,0
3810,Beautiful color and soft texture this piece is flattering and can be worn in many seasons,1
3811,Bummer i fell in absolute love with these gems until i realized how weak the stretch is by the end of the day i purchased them on the th of feb and cant bare to wear them anymore,0
3812,This is an awesome go to for dressy or casual wore it with booties for a dinner and flats for temple and was perfect for both lace is a little delicate but worth the extra care,1
3813,This dress was so comfortable i wore it all day to church out to brunch and actually slept in it it would travel well too,1
3814,Fell in love with the design of this sweater its lightweight appropriately sized with delicate details the pockets are somewhat hidden which is a nice feature the shawl collar falls just right the unique design in the rear makes it stand out from your standard cardigan i purchased in rose for a rich color addition to my wardrobe the xs fit perfectly im and typically wear xs in retailer tops,1
3815,I wish summer was longer so i could have the opportunity to wear this more much more eyecatching and unique in person than the photo stars,1
3816,Love these i bought the grey which is a greytaupelight olive chameleon totally depends upon what i wear with them the rolled up cuff is adorable and the material is perfect the fit is true to size tight but not restrictive comfy all day long and best of all they dont stretch out over the day im a size normally and a size fit me perfectly,1
3817,Very comfortable fit over my muscley and flabby arms very pretty,1
3818,I bought this skirt in my local store when it first came out i have to say it is one of my best retailer purchases ever fits beautifully works with a tee tank denim shirt and more i get so many compliments every time i wear it will be wearing for many summers to come runs tts i am pounds and the fit perfectly it is not too short for work but my legs do need to be tan to wear it,1
3819,Really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different it fits tts but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress which is nice i am pounds and the size fit me perfectly,1
3820,I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful the bodice fits really nicely true to size there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird love love love wearing for christmas eve,1
3821,I had my eyes on this top ever since i saw it online i couldnt be happier with it it is very comfortable flattering and unique i think it will wear well into the fall with black skinnies,1
3822,No only is this a beautiful update to a basic white top it is incredibly soft i couldnt pass it up and wish it came in more colors,1
3823,True to size very pretty as pictured expect that it is more peachy and not this light i like it and will keep it but just be aware that it is not a pale pink as in the picture,1
3824,This is my go to top during the not so cold winter days cant be dressed up or down,1
3825,I just ordered this top and so far really like it it is pretty and feminine and comfortable the one thing i would note is that the lace running down the center has holes which you can see through unlike the lace to each side its not extremely noticeable but i am planning on wearing a cami under it i ordered a small and it fits pretty well but is definitely on the looser side i wonder if possibly the extra small would work for me but im fairly tall so i went with the small,1
3826,I purchased this amazing tunic instore in the plaid pattern and couldnt be more thrilled with it i can already see myself overwearing it because its so pretty and easy i typically wear an xs and sometimes petite styles the regular small fits very well im sure the xs would have been alright but i like the way my forearms dont feel constricted where it buttons and sizing up seemed to help with gaping by the button holes i love the way this looks with a variety bottoms and shoes it,1
3827,Im a powerwalker i bought this tank in colors and rotate through them theyre great for working out with a nice sports bra underneath i also wear them with leggings so cute love the colors the fit yes theyre thin i dont think theyll last for years and years but with the sale price they are such a great deal,1
3828,Such a cute skirt the fabric is comfortable and light and the the tie in the front helps conceal some of those tummy issues a lot of people want to hide,1
3829,I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the onestar reviews i was however pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side noticeable mostly because the fabric doesnt have any give the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive because it is and unique look the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures the darts open out to a much,1
3830,Love this dress it is tighter in the chest area than maybe expected but not unwearable though i am smaller chested it will be great for hot summer days as it has a light lining,1
3831,These leggings are amazing by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own i should have ordered more i got a ml and they fit perfect the detailing is awesome and they even stay opaque when you sit so you dont have to worry about them being seethrough great buy,1
3832,Purchased to speak at an event not only is it very eye catching and i garnered many compliments it fit like it was made for me and was comfortable to wear i questioned ordering a and possibly could have worn a but with the elasticity to the material there was no problem with movement or sitting and i felt hugged in in all the right places,1
3833,I had been eyeing this sweater since it came in for the fall mostly because of the beautiful purple color it finally went on sale and i scooped it up like most reviewers i luv that you can wear it two ways i prefer to wear it closed as i do not have the slimmest waist and this sweater hides this well but it looks just as good open and drapes well on the sides this sweater looks a lot better in person than online like most of the retailer sweaters i have hand washed this a couple times alread,1
3834,Granted that i am not as reed thin or as young as the model but i am tall and reasonably slender i have long hands and small wrists which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out whoknowswhat that youd keep in the car for emergency purposes in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose i was looking for a statement,0
3835,When i first saw this in the retailer catalog i thought it was beautiful i am a sucker for floral prints and unique color combinations both of which this top has im lbs and a small bust at b i usually wear a size but it was a little loose all around so id say it runs big they had the size at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation its a little loose but very flattering and very good quality i definitely recommend it if your shape is s,1
3836,This is my favorite shirt ever ive had it for years and it still looks great please please bring it back,1
3837,Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described color and fit was spot on thank you,1
3838,I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition very disappointing,0
3839,Cute in theory i love the bright colors the tied black collar sash and the s vibe however the fabric is cheap and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern maybe this was intentional but with the shirt i received it looked horrible i sent it back i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam so it is a bit deceiving i wouldnt buy this top at any price based on,0
3840,I have been stalking these pants since they first showed up on retailers site i have never even tried on anything like this before though so have been waiting patiently for a review to get an idea of what they might look like fit likeetc sale plus off was incentive to take the plunge without a review though i am wearing them right now and they are so comfortable and pretty and justeverything summer perfect i am not a shorts person generally wear skirts and dresses these are,1
3841,Large and the material is too bulky i returned it,0
3842,This is a lovely romantic skirt that hangs nicely it is lined except for the ruffle on the bottom as others have said the waistband is stretchy and molds to your shape it is high waisted i called the store to hold a size and for me to try when i got there i finally settled on a size so it runs a bit large i have a inch waist and inch hips if this fits your style give it a try you wont be disappointed,1
3843,I am very particular about jeans its not just the look its the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over the midrise wideleg crop is perfection im and a size these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well i highly recommend,1
3844,I bought this dress to use for maternity photos and it is perfect i love the flow of the skirt and the elastic waistband worked perfect i was able to fit in a size normally a size so i hope to be able to wear it after pregnancy as well i was worried about the bust area being too small and while its a tight fit for me currently it still worked,1
3845,I think this is adorable and am so excited to have bought it it is really flattering i love how it hangs its loose enough without being unflattering at all its a little retro it feels really soft i hope it holds up well im and and i got an xs and it fits perfectly,1
3846,Love the fit of this dress im and the petite extra small fits perfectly the waist is slimming and the cut is not too low also great pattern,1
3847,I love love love this top i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often i think its feminine chic and classic ive worn it several times and i each time ive had more than one person comment on it i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves i usually just unbutton those anyway so no,1
3848,Im usually a small or medium in retailer tops however jackets i tend to wear a smallliking a more fitted look this jacket i also purchased a small but there is plenty of room so might have even worn an xs anyway the material is great is well made wonderful pocketsi super comfy but maybe a little too warm for summer nights i cuffed up the sleeveshad no issue with the length im c and i couldnt be happier with this purchase happy mothers day to me,1
3849,I am very happy with this shirt i dont like skin tight clothes i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots i love the way it flows while i walk very flattering on would definitely recommend,1
3850,This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model the pattern and texture are both lovely and the peplum is surprisingly flattering it is definitely on the short side but i think that gives it a modern look the fabric does not stretch at all but i still think it fits tts if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size but otherwise i would order your normal size,1
3851,I loved this jacket its exactly what i was looking for i set out to find a lightweight sweater or jacket that would keep me warm and also versatile enough to wear with different outfits this definitely fit the bill in addition its really soft and not at all itchy which was a concern i had since it was wool and i ordered it online i have received a bunch of compliments i definitely recommend it,1
3852,This sweater is beautifully detailed however it seems too spring like to be for sale before christmas very pretty the cut may not be for everyone it is like a peplum on the bottom and looks best open as shown on my busty top d it seems cut slightly large but i am keeping my usual size medium ill keep for early spring colors are as shown detail better in person,1
3853,I got this shirt as a gift its cute and very comfortable it ishowever a little thin so you may need to wear something underneath,1
3854,I love love love these white jeans the crop style is great as i am so the fit is perfect for an ankle jeanthese fit the bill in every way they are so comfy,1
3855,Love this shirtgot it in the blue but i will say the print is a very dark navy almost black im lbs d and the size fit me fine so i would disagree with other reviews that says it runs large this is perfect to hide muffin tops with the slight swing style that has a little flair,1
3856,Omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it i tried it on and fell madly in love i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world it is soft and cozy comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam its almost sold out already so grab it if you can cuz its divine does run a little big so i got a instead of a and its perfect,1
3857,I love camisoles like this and retailer always has great ones it has a nice length so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan its fitted but not tight,1
3858,A little more seethrough than you would think but has super cute smaller details also needs to be ironed a lot,1
3859,I love this shirt love love love it i am a curvy girl and it accents all the right features and hides the ones that need to be hiddenbut ive owned it for months and there are already holes in the shirt and not holes in the fabric but holes on the seam lines the stitching is not sturdy enough for the shirt to not fall apart the whole point is to be able to wear it but now i have to bust out my sewing machine to reinforce the seams that split so that i can wear it again,0
3860,Fabric much heavier than looks in picture also nothing mentioned in the description great color and fit but i live in florida,0
3861,Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it i ordered the medium normally wear a size and is a little long but goes with my personal style i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home,1
3862,This is so awesome i love how it fits its great quality its flattering its casual but put together love fits true to size i bought it in white as well,1
3863,I know its for warm weather but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall winter i bought sizes a because i wasnt sure on size the was way big on me but the boxy cut of the left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath,1
3864,So bummed i was really hoping this top would work for me i got the black in regular size and the pink in petite size both hit my breast too high and were too bulky in the mid section i have a sort of short torso wear a small c and am have a defined waist when tops are bulky it gives me no shape and just looks terrible i am having the hardest time finding pretty tops that suit my figure they did not lie flat like on the model but had so much extra fabric they stuck outthe constr,0
3865,Love this chinos they fit tts and the blue is vibrant bought them in pink too for reference i am ampampampampampampquot and weigh lbs and bought size the fit is a bit slouchy much like in the photos,1
3866,It was love at first sight the only problem was that it didnt come in my size i took a chance and order a size smaller and it worked out great its a great item that can be worn in the spring and fall exactly what i was looking for,1
3867,This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt i am very petite pounds and the arms fitlength and width but nothing else about this fit the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs yikes it looks cute on the model but not on me the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top,0
3868,I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect i am and weigh pounds with an approximate difference between hips and waist the size fit perfectly i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey,1
3869,These jeans really look very nice on they are cotton and elastaine if you want the look that you see on this model order one size up i am lbs bought both and decided to keep the mainly because the lower part of the leg was fitting too tight in the looked more like a skinny jean but bunched up at the knee they are tapered i also own a pair of cotton levis wedgie in foot hills in size which fit a bit different than these the foot hills definitel,1
3870,The neck is so big on this sweater i couldnt make it lay right the shape of the sweater is odd it is really wide on the upper torso but tapers near your waist it did not look as depicted on the model the sweater is a lovely color i liked the twotone but overall the fit was too weird for me material is soft and it felt really nice on but just too oddly shaped and a crazy big neck,0
3871,Love this dress the colors are a smidgen darker than the photo shows which i like even better super comfortable nice flow great fit definitely will be a favorite of mine for this summers,1
3872,First of all the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color this isnt necessarily bad but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the websiteat any rate i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing in the summers i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t,1
3873,This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packagingthe mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much,0
3874,I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package its a very vibrant print in the red print almost a picnic vibe and the material feels soft and high quality it runs very large though i usually take an or maybe a and am busty and in this i am pretty sure i will need the i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on but i will return the and get the in the red as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much,1
3875,I was looking for something to wear on jeans fridays this tunic is super cute and looks great with jeggings i did find the sizing small for me but i am busty,1
3876,Dress is so comfortable great for town or resort size a and i got a size small,1
3877,I disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online i received a lot of compliments when i wore it i wore it with black skinny jeans black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket and did not keep on the entire night i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in i really love it maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change,1
3878,Can be dressed up or down the top part is tight while the bottom has a beautiful skirt im slightly busty and about and the size is perfect for me,1
3879,Im so excited that retailer is bringing back some of the gorgeous fabrics and details they used to have the all over embroidary is beautiful the cottonsilk blend is delicious and theres enough shaping that the top doesnt look too boxy i did end up sizing down for a slightly more fitted loo and for a smaller armhole i also picked through a couple of tops to find the one i wanted since the embroidery pattern wasnt centered on some of them,1
3880,Love this turtleneck its perfect for fall and to layer im usually an xs in things from retailer and this is no different i definitely recommend,1
3881,Love love love this jacket im able to dress it up or casual the hint from a review i read to button the lapels back worked awesome good quality has a bit of stretch for bulky shirt to wear underneath would definitely recommend if like the military jacket style,1
3882,Love this vest since i am years old i was hesitant to try on this vest because it was out of my comfort zone as to style but my daughter convinced me to try it on it is absolutely darling and looked so chic on my year old daughter bought it too so it is stylish for any age the fur collar is fun and the fabric is very nice and the vest is well made it can elevate jeans to a dressier look but still have a casual vibe having a coupon the day we shopped made the decision to buy this e,1
3883,I love the weight of the material sometimes crinkled gauze looks cheap this does not the lace trim is more tone than the photo suggests but that is not negative and the color of the dress is more salmon than peach again not a negative the length is as it is on the model just below the knee i wore it to what turned out to be surprise party for me at the beach i paired it with huge silver hoops and silver flipflops i felt special stylish and comfortable it was a good dress for some,1
3884,I am mad for plaidthis dress is my new favorite why ill tell you the picture online does not do it justice but you must add a belt the dress is cut lower in the front but has a great stitch to keep it from gaping open over my d cup chest the material is soft and breathable the xsp was perfect for my frame my typical size,1
3885,The material is velvety smooth and not quite so pink as pictured on the website more of a dusty brown rose well made nice fit flattering on my petite frame a wonderful third piece to complete or elevate an outfit,1
3886,I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite unfortunately the fabric was stiff it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there returned,0
3887,I tried this skirt on in the store it fit like a glove that doesnt happen very often for me but couldnt find the right top to pair w it so i passed on it but when i got home i found the perfect top already in my closet so i ordered it online it doesnt seem to lay quite as nice as the one i tried on in the store but im keeping it regardless highly recommended this skirt fits tts,1
3888,This is a gorgeous shirt it actually looks more fitted on than in this picture where it looks more shapeless even though i love tunics the online picture wasnt appealing to me but when i saw the shirt in store and tried it on i loved it wore it to work today and loved it even more its great quality gorgeous design lovely tailoring and details throughout,1
3889,I ordered this dress online and didnt really know what to expect but to my surprise its exactly what i had hoped it would be the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern interesting print the fabric does seem thin for the price but i am not returning it its a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends i wear it with beige sandals and the gray and beige look good together too,1
3890,Since there isnt one where i live i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up saw this and bought it off the rack wout trying on had to get a m as they were out of s and yes its a tad large on me but still glad i got it i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch,1
3891,I love this blouse its very flattering gives the illusion of an hourglass shape the fabric feels soft and flowy and the pattern is pretty it does need a camisole underneath because its kinda sheer it does run small i usually wear a size in retailer clothes but i bought a size in this shirt and the sleeves are still very snug around my forearms which is unusual for me,1
3892,I just received this top in the mail and i couldnt be happier with how it fits and feels on might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine i am and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them,1
3893,I have this sweater in ivory and raspberry its gorgeous holds up well on had wash cycle also its so flattering im so so happy i bought theses i am athletic build and a normal medium this runs large i bough smalls,1
3894,I just bought these jeans today they are really cute comfortable on i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well they are made well they are always on style i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully comfy stylish,1
3895,This is the perfect dress to transition into fall either dressing it up with wedges or down with a leather jacket i have never purchased this brand ranna gill but needed to size up which is rare for me when i shop at retailer it is comfortable and lightweight i marked it down one star on quality because for the price i have already noticed some of the black lace stitching coming undone,1
3896,Nice light weight fabric drapes well awesome detailing have worn twice already with lots of compliments,1
3897,I saw this top and loved the pattern meadow rue is one of my favorite brands for tops at retailer the pattern is lovely and the fit it tts this top is comfortable for running errands and can be dressed up too very versatile for spring,1
3898,This skirt has a more dusty black background than the website lets on which i love the floral pattern is delicate and subtle and the tiers give this gorgeous skirt the perfect amount of flounce it is so versatile the quality is excellent the skirt is fully lined it will take me easily through three seasons the weight of it might make it a bit too warm for summer im so happy i bought this,1
3899,I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up i was sold after trying it on the material is very soft both feels and looks extremely high quality and for a basic shirtdress it is amazingly flattering follows curves without clinging to them im lbs usually wear a small in topsdresses purchased the size which fit perfectly im slightly chesty d so sometimes ha,1
3900,I love this dress however bc of my broad shoulders i need to size up i would say if you have a straight and slender frame then its tts the bottam half was fine it was a tad bit snug around the arm pits for me it is very cute for spring summer it is sold out,1
3901,I got the small petite and this fits beautifully as on the model i am i do think that it flatters a flat belly more than it would flatter a fatter one it would certainly hide any belly but the drape works best if youre streamlined i imagine if youve got a tapering torso go for it depending on your bust you may want to pin the overlapped fabric just to be sure of hiding the bottom of your bra not that ive found it a problem,1
3902,Super light and soft havent worn it out but expect to wear with jeans it will be cute and comfy im lbs and bought a small fits well,1
3903,Omg i am absolutely in love with this dress i saw it on line and knew immediately that i had to have it i decided to go into the store to try it and it looks even better on than it did on the website the aline shape is very flattering and the retro pattern and colors are amazing the only down side if there even is on is that it is a little tight across the chest but i am a ddd so sometimes that happens i just took a large rather than my usual medium other than that this dress is my fav,1
3904,This dress is very comfortable i bought both the small xsmall and ended up keeping the xsmall i am lbs c,1
3905,I love dolan dresses the fabrics are always beautiful and the colors are always unique i usually wear an xs petite in dolan but i ordered both the xs and the xs petite and i think im going to keep the xs i had a hard time deciding which to keep but the xs petite was just a hair too short i think this is a versatile dress for all seasons you could pair it with tights in fallwinter but it is great for springsummer too,1
3906,This is a beautiful blouse and well made i read the previous reviews and im usually between sizes and so i sizedup and ordered size and it fits well i purchased the pink and its soo pretty im very satisfied with my purchase and i highly recommend this blouse,1
3907,I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers moss copper and burgundy they are soft wellfitting pretty linings and very satisfactory this new version is stiff material and illfitting not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better but it is too full across the front with the stiff materials this is a bad fit disappointing and going back,0
3908,Love love love these leggings a soft colorful comfortable way to show your artistic flare,1
3909,This skirt is a real dress up piece it is simply stunning and indeed appears to have been designed by an artist the aqua blue lining adds a definite pop of color while the shimmering knit outer layer is simply lovely i plan to wear it out to dinner with friends this weekend and know that i will receive lots of compliments,1
3910,Lovely dress but i would recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally do,1
3911,This shirt is super soft and comfortable luckily its a good length and not at all short,1
3912,This dress is light airy easy and comfortable to wear i love the colors and pattern it looks wonderful with or without a belt i sized down from a to a i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back although i am a size the under slip fits perfectly in a size i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan this dress is a keeper,1
3913,This is such a cute dress and i dont know why know one has reviewed it yet its different and fun i have worn it to work once and have gotten several compliments on it i found that it does run a bit short so i wore it with leggings,1
3914,Beautifullightweight and well tailored more dressy than what it appears in photo,1
3915,I saw this today and decided to try it on it fit perfectly i have a generous bosom e and a large fit without gaping or the button issues a previous reviewer noted the fabric is comfortable no itching too bad its degrees im ready to wear this,1
3916,A friend of mine has several of these jackets and i always asked where did you find that from the answer retailer vegan leather jackets i bought when they were on sale and i love both grey and dark brownpurple they are super comfy and surprisingly warm can dress up or dress down for any occasion i cant wait to buy more,1
3917,Way too longthe sizing is incredibly off on this product order a size or two down,0
3918,I bought this jacket in a regular and returned it to the store where they had a petite it is lovely i live in ca so it is perfect for an evening out remember not to buy this for warmth but a light cover up it makes an outfit out of anything else you might want to wear looks great with black under it or off white also looks great with the beautiful soft pinks that are out this season or cranberry you will love it,1
3919,I ordered this shirt in the xl in both colors and i am in love as a large chested lady with a bit extra around the middle this shirt is super flattering and perfect for everyday summer weather im sure i will be wearing this all summer yay retailer,1
3920,This sweater is so much cuter than the online picture makes it look i think the model is wearing it too large anyway this runs kind of big so size down its kind of short in the front but it hits at a nice flattering spot love it,1
3921,This dress is gorgeous the color is perfect for springsummer the dress does run wideloose i read reviews before ordering and i am glad that i did i am usually a petite size but the reviews recommended going with the regular due to length and the design at the bottom and wanting to be able to bend over comfortably i am and about lbs i ordered the regular and it worked well i received many compliments,1
3922,I love love love this top the color is beautiful a pinkishorange about exactly how it looks online it is soft and light weight for summers it does run a little big i debated between a and a and ended up with a im almost and lbs for reference it wings out on the sides at first once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely so dont let that turn you off from it when trying it on part of the design is cut out through out as a warning,1
3923,I noticed some reviewers didnt like the loose shape of the dress it is indeed a dress with a looser silhouette than most but thats what makes it unique and expensive looking i loved the extra material in the dress especially in the back it flowed gracefully and beautifully i can imagine wearing this dress for many occasions and feeling instantly chic with minimal effort it was also very figure flattering i ordered the size l and it was a perfect knee length so i would say this dres,1
3924,I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off i tried them on and loved them they will be perfect summer pants because theyre so light and not clingy at all the material is great these will also be really fun to wear at the beach i could stand for them to be about an inch longer but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length definitely worth trying o,1
3925,I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black not this one this is truly bw i love the stripes the length at the knee and the pockets time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable the collar seems to stay down which makes it look s but fabric tape easily fixed it overall i love it,1
3926,These photos do not do the vest any justice i randomly saw this in the sale section at my local retailer tried it on and it was super cute but i did the whole walk away maybe youll forget about it thing that did not happen i ran back to retailer on my lunch break the next day and thank goodness there was still one left in my size it actually drapes in a flattering way and it looks polished its so versatile i would not have looked for this vest based on these photos but im telling y,1
3927,Received this in the mail today and was disappointed i typically wear a but bought this in the as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an this does not fit the same at all the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body needless to say i will be returning this item,0
3928,Comfortable casual hip i have the black white color which is a bit thicker than the other colors which i prefer as i recently had a baby and need a little extra fabric i wish the fabric was a bit softer but the cut is so flattering there was no way i was sending it back i wish the other colors were in the same thicker fabric and i would have ordered more my new go to top the black ribbon on the back is my favorite part,1
3929,I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from herethis has to be the best thing ive ever purchased it is so soft and beautiful i am and lbs and got the ml fits perfectly and doesnt swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing it does sit at an angle on the body but to me thats so perfect a little different and not a defect it is not itchy whats so ever i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo,1
3930,I loved this skirt so flattering and such a beautiful fabric unfortunately after only wears the waistband stretched out so much that it was falling off me literally i bought the right size and it was not too tight the waist band material simply lost its stretch very quickly very disappointing,0
3931,Love the design i got the blue and green one it was more seethrough than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesnt matter what color bra you wear,1
3932,I bought these pants online in blue and loved them so much that i bought them in the bronze two days later very flattering fit comfortable great quality and i look and feel like a class act wearing them theyre a bit of a looser taper style of fit but thats just the style and ive received so many compliments on them,1
3933,It runs large but thats okay its great quality and super super soft i love the way it makes you feel so comfortable very disappointed the clip fell off,1
3934,Oh what a disappointment i was looking forward to wearing this as a layering piece with the shawl cardigan the material lacks serious quality and it was ripped on the seam so back it goes and i am flabbergasted at the price retailer is charging almost for this top,0
3935,I purchased the purple t with letters all over great fit long and not clingy at all i love the s motifstyle of the letters perfect tshirt for a teacherthe black design was strange hearts fox cats it just seemed random and no theme i would buy colors of this tshirt because it fits so well but the black green design was too off,1
3936,I have been waiting for this poncho to hit my local retailer it was as good as it looks online the perfect piece to put on over a tank or tshirt you can dress it up or down and i love that it has pockets i wear a and i bought the ml this is meant to be oversized so buy appropriately,1
3937,Wow this sweater is as other reviewers have said perfect weight and the colors are vibrant and will work well with fall colors im so im always hoping the length works and in this case it does i am very happy with this,1
3938,The fabric is a nice weight knit and the top generally well made unfortunately the fit was enormous ive an athletic build w big boobs normally wear l in retailer tops,0
3939,This top is so pretty and festive i am purchasing it for a holiday party i debated between a m and l but went with the m and im glad i did it is generously sized finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky im thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown,1
3940,I should have listened to the previous review online before ordering unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off i love uniquely shaped wraps like this but this one didnt make the cut for me,0
3941,This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous everything about this skirt works dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way and super comfortable no petite left so i purchased a regular and it fits perfectly i am ftin waist hips the hem falls about in longer than shown on the model this skirt is sold out fast no surprise it flatters all body types at all ages get ready for lots of compliments,1
3942,Ag is my goto brand for comfortable high quality jeans these fit the bill,1
3943,I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasnt a deal breaker for me the flowy shape it ideal for summer,1
3944,This was disappointing to me i love how this looks on the model unfortunately it made me look huge it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on i didnt find it was tts i am a m and got the m it was too tight in the waist before id even put it on i noticed the waist looked very small i dont even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching its like the buttons didnt match up or something,0
3945,I ordered the orange motif in short sleevesand i got what i ordered and love it it is a little big but i wanted a looser top i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans this top meets my needs for sure i really like the detailing on the top collarbone area my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful so i take this as a win,1
3946,Im surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet ive had it for a couple of months and love it it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf the color is beautifulive gotten many compliments on this too it fits well and has a small texture which makes it more interesting,1
3947,As in previous reviews this top can be worn in many ways it could even be used as a pretty bathing suit coverup i like it with my cropped cotton spandex leggings which i have in many solid colors i plan to wear it unbuttoned with my classic style spandex tanks i have in various colors prints the complete look says summer feels cool comfy in this warm weather even hubby loves the look i bought my usual size small,1
3948,If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut,1
3949,I would have loved this sweater if it were true to the picture but the stripes are gray not white either i got a strange one or as happens to me sometimes with retailer the pictures are very misleading disappointed because i wanted to love this,0
3950,I really wanted to not like the top for that price but ti looks really good the beading makes the shirt stunning i ordered the p not sure what size to get and it is just fine the length is almost too short but isnt the rest of the shirt fits nicely the shoulder are wide like poofing out a bit perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer but not crazy debating whether to keep it but right now i love it also teh colla,1
3951,I wanted a casual denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight and this skirt fit my needs perfectly im lbs and the xs fits me true to size hitting about inches above the knee its a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath the raw edge is subtle no hanging threads and unique i cant speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility,1
3952,I was on the fence about ordering this jacket but im so glad i did i got my birthday discount to help afford it as the first reviewer said the weight is substantial but not too heavy and the embroidery is beautiful i have not worn this jacket yet but i expect to get many compliments when i do i usually dont wear jackets in this style so its a fresh new approach for methe embroidery takes it to the next level it fits true to size i usually take a medium and the medium fits pe,1
3953,I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store but i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash even when following washing instructions i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially im so disappointed how can you make a shirt that cant withstand washing,0
3954,I like this sweater for its classic shape and grosgrain ribbon finish on the placket it does have buttons all the way down and they are a little hard to open but the style is fun and fresh it will dress up or down as shown with jeans and tee shirt fit is like on the model for me in a large as i usually wear a on top the arms are quite long even for me at,1
3955,Loved it online for its modern cut and print however when i received the item i was disappointed i ordered my usual size and i was swimming in it i like oversized things and understand that this dress is made that way however this was not flattering i would say i would have needed to size down to a and perhaps it would work but i didnt want to take another chance the material seemed almost crepey which i wasnt neccissarily expecting either bummer that it didnt work out,0
3956,The catalog shot and model shot are completely different its like not even the same dress the neckline color the quality of lace,0
3957,I bought a size s in the navy and m in the neutral and both fit i usually wear a small but they only had the size m left in the neutral the m is a little big but the extra room fits the flowy bohemian style of the blouse so it works i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors definitely recommend it,1
3958,Love this dress it is so comfortable it fits great and can be dressed up or down hides the tummy too,1
3959,These pants are so fun i use them to sleep in as they are see through i had to size up as the waist band gave me muffin top i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large,1
3960,This is my new favorite dress i cant tell you how flattering it is i just had a baby a few months ago and its the only piece of clothing i actually feel like i look like my old prebaby self in im on the shorter side very busty because im nursing and about lbs i got a mp and it fits great i could have gotten the small but i feel that would have been too low cut honestly love the cut the pattern everything about it would buy again,1
3961,Just as breathtaking in person and in a totally comfortable soft stretch fabric im lbs b purchased the size and for comparison decided on size as the size was really tight in the chest areameant only for the tiniest the dress is long on me and ill likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the kneesbut im grateful its too long something i can fix rather than being too short,1
3962,I love how it fits very flattering the quality of the cotton part of this top is a little less in quality of that fabric than i expected but i love this top and i foresee wearing it all year round,1
3963,This dress pops gorgeous colors and simple classic flowy design i thought it ran a little big i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow b for reference,1
3964,I disagree with the other review i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailermodel the sweater knit is lighter weight it is not heavy it fits more tightly to the body which i like the material is soft to me and navy color has a graytone to it i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y,1
3965,I ordered a large and despite wearing a large in many other items from antrhopologie this item was too small especailly across the bust it was very wellmade and the color green is beautiful but unfortunately i will not be able to wear it so disappointed,0
3966,I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and it is a stunner really one of the most gorgeous dresses ive ever owned it is very very fancy and really id say most appropriate for a black tie event an evening wedding or a mother of the bride or groom superb quality just amazing i have a few bryon lars dresses and this one seems to run about true to size the others i own seem to run a little large,1
3967,I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large im d and the top closes without gaping even when i push my shoulders back its kind of sheer so will wear a cami underneath the waist nips in right where it should giving a trim silhouette adorable and fun top without being cutesy love tylho tops,1
3968,I saw this skirt online and loved the vibrant colors pattern and style it looks even prettier in person the material is light and soft the skirt is fully lined so you dont have to worry about it being seethrough also the skirt is a good length for me and wont drag on the floor happy with purchase recommend,1
3969,I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online the slip underneath is a nude color it fit well and i decided to keep it i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it i was driving with my son in the back seat i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress where the crocheting is ripped open i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price,0
3970,The sweater is very soft it has an interesting pattern i purchased the neutral color in size xs which runs tts its definitely a cozy sweater to wear this winter,1
3971,The sweater is very comfy and looked good the first time i tried it on however the material is thin and slightly see throughalso after one wear it completely stretched out and made the long sleeves awkward to wear without washing in between each wear after the third time i wore it i discovered a large hole in the armpit most likely due to the excessive washing i would not recommend this sweater,0
3972,This dress fits great i love that its fitted at the top but drapery and swingy at the bottom it has a thicker tshirt type fabric i will definitely style this with a variety of necklaces or a scarf and cardigan for cooler weather its much cuter in person for reference im and got xs,1
3973,Recd so many compliments on this absolutely beautiful comfortable and versatile try it with white crops and cute heels,1
3974,I absolutely love this blousei ordered it in peachthen waited for the raspberry to come back in my sizenow i have colorsit runs really largebut putting a tank or cami underneath is fun,1
3975,I love this dress and am strongly considering buying the white too but i wish it came in another color other than white or black because i would get that goes great for nice dinners dates weddings almost anything its not ballgown fancy but just fitted and nice enough to wear for work or a nice evening out only problem i have are with the clips in the front i have a hard time using the loo because it is very fitted you have to un clip them and then reclip but its worth the effort,1
3976,This top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person the neckline is very high which was a surprise for a summer tank but its cut well nice surprise on seem pockets wore it today for the first time and received many comments a keeper fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top,1
3977,I love this sweater its warm comfortable and soft nice quality too,1
3978,Great long cardigan i wear this with a simple tank,1
3979,Very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment the model is positioned so that you cant see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam i actually like the seam it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done there are two layers that form the cowl and ive found that it means wardrobe malfun,1
3980,I have featured a picture below im feet lbs i ordered an xs petite im pretty busty so i dont like a loose fitting top so ordering a size down did the trick its super soft one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element im enjoying wearing the top,1
3981,Its a perfect maternity dress but i love that i will still be able to wear it with a belt once the baby comes,1
3982,I purchased these pants on as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february after about wears with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling the pants wore through in between my legs the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could,0
3983,These jeans look better in person the pattern is more subtle than the picture online these run true to size for ag denim,1

3985,Great pants great fall colors great for day or night super fun and funky love them,1
3986,I love how comfortable this dress is i ordered an xs and it fit perfectly im and it falls to just above my knee it holds its shape and is very flattering pair it with a cute denim jacket and ankle boots for fall or a light scarf and ballet flats for spring,1
3987,Another tentlike tee this shirt is thin but not in a bad way and the color and design are really nice butit is really boxy and im just tired of that look the longer sleeves are a plus for fall,0
3988,I was considering this online for days before a ladies lunch date meandered into a brick mortar location i had been thinking of sizing up if i ordered online just to be sure it wouldnt be too tight or awkward and when i had looked for it in stores nearby it was out of stock but i hadnt thought to look for my tts which happened to be available in the store where i went i tried it on because i was so curious and it worked i love it it is so easybreezy it will be perfect to layer,1
3989,Ive been wanting to try on this dress since it popped up online we visited san francisco this weekend i finally got my chance it fit great was flattering i am currently pregnant it worked with my growing belly but will also look good when i do not have a belly i would definitely recommend,1
3990,I found this jumpsuit at my local retailer it must have been a web order return i love it the fit is true size the colors are perfect its very comfortable and gorgeous on and at the sale price i could not pass it up,1
3991,This is such a great top it can be easily dressed up or down i love my tops flowy and this is just that i have a larger chest d and the flowy nature of it keeps it from being too short up front even though it has eyelits in it it can be worn without a cami underneath as long as you wear a good nude bra itll be a great sweater for all seasons im even able to wear it to work highly highly recommend,1
3992,Love i am lbs with short legs and a long torso i was worried these would be too longthey fit to perfection super excited about this purchase,1
3993,Beautiful color great quality on sale too a must have,1
3994,I had it on my wish list for a long time not sure whether i should purchase i even hesitated when it went on sale but boy am i glad i did order it it is crazy comfortable flattering and love that it looks black but is blue i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots not too short i am foot the fake leather part concerned me at first but i like it now nothing bad ot say about it,1
3995,I was a little hesitant to order this thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong this shirt is super cute and comfy it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up ankle jeans and my fave oxfords im lbs and went with the size regular,1
3996,Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable great fit good colors and doesnt wrinkle easily,1
3997,Ag jeans have been a main stay for me they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked the fabric and color is beautiful i wear the same size for ag no matter the design but this one ran too small i have to return it i will try the next size up if they still have them,0
3998,I feel like a pessimist but then again nothings perfect the only thing wrong with this stunning sweater is no button or snap so it just bags open love it tho,1
3999,This skirt arrived today and i love it the fabric is substantial and can be worn in the fall and maybe even on a mild california winter day i plan on wearing it with tights andor boots the fabric will go with a variety of colored tops and sweaters its not pull on styling it has a side zipper fits true to size but is longer on me than the model but then i am pretty short got this on sale,1
4000,I love this shirt it is so feminine and comfortable will be on repeat,1
4001,This top fits great maybe a tad on the large side but not enough to go down a size i love the fit the bell sleeves and peplum are so flattering definitely worth the price too,1
4002,I just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet ive been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it it fits like it was made just for me the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem the second layer is form fitting and soft i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down like a lady and take in my surroundings after all life,1
4003,Hesitated to try it on because it was tshirt dress and my experience has been that fabric is unforgiving for dimples or imperfections i was wrong with this one its great color is nice fabric looks textured bc of the dye the neck line is perfect i like a lower v and the length is great bc of the side slits i tried it on with the front panel knotted at the bottom how it was on the hanger and i love it had to get can dress up or down but id say this has mostly a casual feel,1
4004,I love almost all tops from retailer however this one was just enormous it is beautifully designed but it was so huge when i tried it on that i couldnt believe it was sized i even checked the tag to see if maybe they placed a size tag on an xl shirt for reference i am and lbs i would have loved this shirt if it hadnt been so big,0
4005,I love this topi waited for it to go on sale and it was well worth it it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up the arms do run a little tight overall the mock neck button closure on the back and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look,1
4006,Fits large wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price,0
4007,Wanted to love this top and could imagine lots of outfits with it the wide shoulders made my armsshoulders look big the ruching and extra flap landed at an odd place accentuating my belly it did arrive very wrinkled although a previous reviewer said she found it to be a wrinkle free garment maybe that made the look worse overall i felt that it made me look lbs heavier than i am so back it goes i am lbs dddd and the size large was the correct size,0

4012,I tried this dress at the store today and couldnt leave without it also tried the pacquerette shirtdress which has a similar bohopeasant vibe and overall preferred the fit and look of this one plus its lined which the paquerette shirtdress is not for the same price fit was very similar to the anwen peasant dress which i also have and the regular size xs fit me much the same as in that dress it is maybe inch longer though but still that makes it a couple of inches above the knee for,1
4013,I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store i am with a slender build i tried my usual xs but couldnt manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline the band is so small even fully stretched out i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder i gave up after wrestling with it i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking mefunny but not funny,0
4014,Another maeve maxi to add to my crowded closet i adore the print it reminds me of morocco i went with my usual m based on reviews about the waistband i will have to disagree as i should have chosen s instead im not going to return it but i think this will really stretch out because of the knit and weight of the jersey,1
4015,The pictures online do not do this jacket justice i saw it hanging in the store and had to have it even before i tried it on its extremely versatile worn as shown as a layered look or the zipped liner is can be removed and this can be worn as a simple blazer its the perfect weight for springfall its fitted and so cute this jacket runs true to size not large i usually wear a and the small fit perfectly,1
4016,I bought the lavender in my normal large the fabric drapes wonderfully and does not cling to my midsection the texture of the fabric is much more interesting than the photos online show there is beautiful shimmer tot he heather in the color in my lavender shirt there is pinkgraylavendarwhitesilver depth to the fabric i plan on getting at least two more colors i recommend washing all shirts like this in a nylon bag in the machine then line drying i have done this for years with al,1
4017,Very nice fabric and quality but runs very large i had to return my pair of a size stinks to pay for shipping on a product that looks so different in the picture,0
4018,Lovely top well made and feels wonderful on attention petites i highly suggest you go for petite sizing because the standard xs is ginormous and looked nothing like it does on the model pictured,1
4019,What a great find this is so easy to dress up or down and a very comfortable fit and fabric the skirt fabric is pretty form fitting so not something i can comfortably wear to work but its a versatile piece otherwise the buttons on the sleeve are a nice touch,1
4020,So i saw this dress like a month ago and i fell in love utter ihavetohaveit love before dropping superfast i gave myself some time to think it over well of course i decided to order it and of course my size was sold out most of the sizes were sold out actually they did have a petite left so after i dried my eyes i decided to wing it the petite actually fit the mid section is a little snugger than i am normally comfortable with although the top is so structured that it ac,1
4021,I wore this sailboat dress with blue wedges to a wedding and received tons of compliments from men women and children i love the material pockets and flattering cut definitely iron it beforehand because it wrinkles,1
4022,Beautiful dress when you look at it on the hanger you think this could be really good or really bad but it is absolutely beautiful would highly recommend it can dress it up or down,1
4023,I tried this dress on in a and a a is a little small for me but it looked so loose and flowy i thought sizing down would be a good idea the fit in the outer layer however as the previous poster mentioned the lining is super tight i couldnt even pull the lining down over my hips the was far too big in the shoulders and arms and still too tight in the lining not sure what when wrong here but its a shame because its a really cute dress,0
4024,If youre on the fence about this dress go for it i am a huge retailer shopper but havent ever been compelled to write a review until now this dress fits beautifully the materials is so soft and comfortable and the design of the dress is very flattering with or without a belt i am pounds and i purchased the pxs its perfect i wore this with booties and received a ton of compliments the fringe and hemline make this dress really stand out,1
4025,I agree completely with the previous reviews suggesting that this top is much prettier in person i failed to notice this top online but was drawn to it in the store the green color it is perfect for early fall weather although i could probably wear the xs i ordered the xxs online after trying on the xs because i wanted it to be a bit shorter and have less extra fabric in hopes that it would be just that much more flattering,1
4026,Great little transitional piece i bought the blkblk floral one its not your usual top sort of quirky one of a kind looking i think its crazy comfortable i just love it even its a bit chilly outdoors toss on a scarf round ones neck head on out not the kind of top youd wear with a jacket,1
4027,This sweater is the bomb its soft flattering and looks good with everything i ordered a second one to have when this one gets worn out,1
4028,This is my goto shirt perfect for layering perfect for around the house or perfect for topping an outfit with a scarf the white is a little sheer but its fine for me,1
4029,Unfortunately this dress is shaped like a sack and has no shape to speak of i have sent it back for a refund too big too shapeless,0
4030,I got a size xxsp which is perfect although i usually wear a xs petite or xs im currently dc bra with narrow shoulders and torso a bit longwaisted the ribbed darby sweater hugs every single curve without being tight low cut but not as low as on the model very flattering neckline sleeves end about an inch above my elbows and can be folded upwell made very lightweight knit of cotton polyester the ribbing detail is very well thought out there is bias,1
4031,I love this t shirt and have not purchased it in all colors very soft and very flattering i like the longer length as well as the pretty neckline,1
4032,This dress has special written all over it the poms at the hem and bodice as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out i like all the varying textures it looks great with sandals or short boots fits true to size a nice sassy length,1
4033,These jeans are so cute they are perfect for petites too i am fit look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans im im libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way just like the photo pretty much they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit,1
4034,I love this black turtleneck arms are a little long so should have gotten small i wore it and love it you can play with collar and snaps up or down,1
4035,Every single time i was in a store this dress caught my eye there was never a large or xl to try on however so when a free shipping offer came up i took a chance and ordered both the xl was too large the large was much better but a little snug so if it shrunk i would have been out of luck if i would have kept one it would have been the large however they are both going back a plaid dress sounds like a good idea for the winter when you look at it on the hanger but on a body it is,0
4036,Im returning this jacket i tried it on after it was delivered and was happy with the weight cut and color although its more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture however the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt it will last very long i actually cant get the zipper to zip at all its very rough and lightweight and im afraid if i keep trying to force it ill just end up breaking it sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality thi,0
4037,I purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation it looks chic and classy feels comfortable and warm i only wish it was about inches longer im and it hits at low thigh i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style love it,1
4038,I am a sucker for a good swing top i own many styles from retailer and similar retailers i carry my weight in my stomach butt and hips so this style is always good for me as soon as i saw this online i fell hard and waited patiently for it to arrive at my store finally it did i love this top its very swingy almost cut like a circle so there is tons of room in the body the sleeve is more fitted but my arms are larger so it might just be fitted for me there is a bit of stretch to it the,1
4039,Great dress for vacations,1
4040,I knew the ivory color was online only so i tried the blue one for size and i couldnt believe how nice the blue one is i ended up buying it i purchased a size bigger because mine wasnt available but because of lace and side zip it still doesnt look huge if i find my size in another store i can always exchange but i couldnt leave the dress behind,1
4041,No but im not a small person im a size on top on bottom i dont love this on the model online but i saw this on naomis blog love taza and thought it looked amazing i tried it on in my retailer and while they only had a ml since im tall i figured thatd be fine oh no not fine its huge like it could almost cover a twin bed it was a couple inches longer on me than on the model and doesnt arc down in a drape nearly as well so just looks huuuge i thought i was bein,0

4043,I ordered this in cream during the sale i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty but it was not my size so i didnt try it on when it arrived it was a wrinkled mess it was so wrinkled that i dont think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular it was also way too short for me ill be taking it back very soon i do plan,0
4044,The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line,1
4045,These are fantastic jeans true to size but know that if you are average height youll need to wear heels with these imo flare pants look much better with heels anyway,1
4046,I ordered the xxs p and it is almost big so between true to size and big it is both flattering and stretchy the waist comes in nicely the sleeves are not annoying and the sparkle add to the lbd in my opinion length was right above the kneejust i am lbs dd in waist for reference,1
4047,I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down with skirts leggings trousers jeanswith a vest jacket or sweater or on its own it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule,1

4049,I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo but i guess my frame was still to petite the fabric was also on the cheap end,0
4050,Love this skirt beautiful fabric and lined looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket i chose the size though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size i am lbs and inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button love the edgy look so,1
4051,This shirt looked plain online but when i see it in store i thought its so pretty it is the oversized style when i tried it on its so flattering even though it is oversized but it doesnt make you look chunky at all i got it while it was on sale with extra off i range from to xs s for retailer sizes i got a xs for this top,1
4052,I bought this top in all four colors soft material elegant design relaxed fit a true staple for every closet,1
4053,This dress is so cute but its going back the zipper is horrible and all of the other reviews are true youll need to size up,0
4054,I ordered the red motif in size m based on reviews this top runs small and it is too big im c lbs and usually a size s in this brand this top was large through the body and the arm openings were huge i washed it and dried it but it still fits a bit large it did wash up well though no pilling,1
4055,I saw this top online but i didnt fall in love with it until i tried it on in the store the retailer salesperson told me that she owned this top and that she always received many compliments when wearing it but she also warned me that the rhinestones on the sleeves were a problem as they kept getting snagged in the fabric on the body i decided to purchase the top in the end because it is so beautiful and one of a kind but i ended up removing all of the rhinestones on the sleeves and i haven,1
4056,I wore this bodysuit once it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,0
4057,Im a big retailer buyer and usually love the dresses especially the petite xs maxis this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made it was humongous and gave me no shape even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same im small but i mean come on this would only fit a giantess which also makes no sense because its the petite size do not buy im very upset i have to pay the return fee since i ordered this,0
4058,I purchased the blue color and its gorgeous im and the length is perfect not too billowy and not too tight the fabric is a nice gauzy summer weight,1
4059,Ive been eyeing this piece for a while and gave in when there was a sale admittedly i was first drawn away when i read that it was a pull on style which always seemed cheap to me however it worked in my favor since the small was a tad big but the draw string helped cinch it the store currently didnt have xs the skirt as shown on the model seems like itll be great as a transitional piece for autumn and winter and when i tried it in the fitting room i paired it with a cardigan and a,1
4060,I absolutely love the look and fit of these pants what is even better is that they dont stretch out while wearing them i will get a lot of use out of them,1
4061,I was very pleased with this purchase lovely print good fit and silky fabric,1
4062,This is a simplistic beauty the colors are lovely and as pictured i believe it is tts but if your small busted you could probably go down a size i personally stayed with my small and i lke the flow of it the flannel has a nice weight to it so you can wear this fall winter and early spring if you live in a cooler climate,1
4063,Hands down my new favorite top love the look of this top i would say this runs a little big i definitely could have sized down however the flowy style of my usual retailer size works for me in this piece,1

4065,I am almost always an xs in bottoms sz but literally couldnt get the stretchy waistband no zip or fastening in xs up my hips in addition the brocade is a very lightweight polyestery tinselly weavedoes not suggest quality as others have noted it also runs short im and this was a little below knee length on me not anklelength ive had luck with retailers sale section in the past including some items that didnt always start off with the best reviews but have no regret,0
4066,I ordered this dress in my usual sz it seemed to be tight on the hips then i tried the next sz and it was tight because i realized that the lining was very sticky and would bunch up underneath making the dress look defective on me not for curvy on bottom i think if you are more slim down below this will maybe work but i had to return for this reason i was considering cutting out the lining because it was so cute and i really liked the look of the dress if it goes on sale i may purch,0
4067,This skirt is gorgeous i love the dots the heavy fabric the slight metallic in the weave it also has two exposed zippers one on either side of the waist which gives it an edgy vibe a perfect counter balance to the s circle skirt cuteness however not knowing my size in tracy reese i ordered my usual retailer size i cannot even zip it i measured it and the size has a inch waist there is about an inch of give in the band but the elastic is so heavy it would not be flattering to,1

4072,Starts out crisp but not too tight doesnt overstretch through the course of the day very comfortable but looks polished front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness which is good because being white they pick up stains easily be careful with underwear lines thong probably best,1
4073,I have a narrow face and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me this proportion is perfect follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line color isnt quite laden green its more teal which works even better for me so hard to find a wool coat these days that isnt bulky,1
4074,I love this dress high quality dress in a classic style the cotton eyelet detailing is my favorite part and really elevates this from just another black dress it is a swing silhouette as described in the product description so there is a little more volume than a regular dress but thats what makes it fun and breezy great dress cant wait to wear it when it gets a little warmer,1
4075,Like one of the previous reviewers when my jacket arrived it was not in the great dark wash pictured online it was in a basic medium denim wash i like the wash pictured online i did not like the wash the jacket came in additionally know that it is just huge i ordered my usual size medium and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was i never tried an xs but it was s,0

4079,The fabric on this tee is a very very soft thin cotton knit its perfect for those hot muggy summers esp in the southern area of the us the sizing runs larger i am normally an xl and because of the other reviews saying it ran big i got this in a l and it fits me fine and theres room to spare so if you are a size or this will fit in a l nicelyits thin but i dont think its immodest or too sheer a white or beige bra would not show through this easily at all the leng,1

4087,I put this runs small but its a little more tts except the arms are very slim if you like to push your sleeves up like this model you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and im a petite the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters which i actually prefer the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out but th,1

4096,This dress is the perfect length and so comfortable its conservative enough to wear to work as a teacher but also so cute im and the large hits right above my ankle medium fit as well but i wanted a little extra room in the torso,1
4097,These were so perfect for the first hour or so i was convinced they were my new favorite pants but their initial forgiveness turned into a slovenly stretch and they creased and wrinkled like crazy after id been sitting a couple hours it looked downright embarrassing saggy and wrinkly radiating from the crotch no less i got them in the gray and its possible that other colors use different less awful fabric,0
4098,Love this dress im lbs i ordered p the dress is stretchy at all the right places and accentuates your curves its very wellmade i usually like loose fitting clothes but i feel this dress needs to be snug but not tight i tried p and it was just a bit loose this dress is wellworth the price,1

4105,I saw this dress in my local retailer store and am not sure why i did not try it on then but later at home it began to haunt me i loved the colored embroidery against the black my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldnt take up too much room and be suitable for times when i wanted to dressup a little online i saw that it was available in the petite and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite,1

4113,The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt it is very visible and looks terrible especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt do not recommend,0

4115,I really love this sweater it is very flatteringespecially in the back and the color is very versatile so it can compliment virtually anything the tie does not go all the way around the waste which took me a little getting used to but it is not a problem for me it is comfortable and keeps to the quality of other boiled wool products just be careful washing it i washed mine on hand cycle which is usually fine for everythingeven cashmere but this one didnt survive it lesson learned an,1
4116,This sweater does have a matching tie belt it is detached no belt loops im guessing the previous reviewer accidentally threw it away with packing material i loved this sweater on line i could not bring myself to order it at full price with tax it would have cost over seemed too pricey for a sweater when it was marked down to with free shipping i couldnt hit buy fast enough i was afraid it would sell out before i got through check out my disappointment was the color it is fa,1

4125,I absolutely love this skirt i purchased both a medium and a large i found that it ran big i typically wear a size i ended up keeping the medium and it was perfect,1
4126,This looked nothing like the picture on me was long and very unflattering belled out greatly at the bottom also the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality but overall awkward,0
4127,I love the muted red pleated ruffle tank i usually wear a large in retailer tops this top fit a bit loose there is a bit more space around the armholes this only concerns me because i cant wear a bra or cami without it showing just mentioned this in case others may wish to buy one size smaller i am around and weight lbs love the young modern tops that i find at retailer i just ordered the white version of this tank top in a medium to see how it will fit btw there is a,1
4128,I love this swisuit it is very well made and super flattering ive received so many compliments on it i have little kids and months so it is perfect for chasing them around at the pool or beach i am still working on losing the baby weight so the rusching in front works well to hide my tummy i am and about lbs and the size works well im hoping it will go on sale so i can buy another one but i imagine these will sell out quickly,1
4129,Stumbled upon this dress which had been returned to a store and was encouraged to try it on by the sales staff and am glad i did its a beautiful dress that i didnt need and have no idea what i will wear it for but bought anyway i got a size and it fits perfectly though i will need to shorten it a bit i am busty and prefer a bit more coverage so will add more tulle to the v neck i agree with the other reviewer about the tulle underlay but it looks easy enough to remove from the lining o,1
4130,Is this dress ever flattering i have seen many variations of this kind of dresssome where they will kriscross over the breast area some where they will have a single twistbut i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh what a difference it makes i particularly love this in bluewhich was a very bright royal color instore i am not very chesty so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love,1

4137,I saw these in the sale section on line and just loved their look they fit great and have a cute little flare at the bottom i like the reinforced inside seams which means they will last longer ive been wearing them with my shorter boots and booties this winter i have slim legs and they arent too tight and not too loose my inseam is a so they may be a tad short on me but i love them,1
4138,I really wanted to love these i bought them in a rush because i needed to replace my skinny jeans asap they were a little long and didnt quite hug my calves but i figured with hemming they would be fine i was told they wouldnt stretch out much well they fit great at the waist but the legs are now huge on me and i cant get them to shrink wish i spent a little more on a different skinny jean too late to return so my hoping to be going out jeans are now lazy day jeans,0

4143,I received this top today and though the color is not white as shown in the pic its a beautiful top its more ivory as mentioned the lace is like a liningcovering the entire body except the arms underneath the ribbed fabric like the other reviewer mentioned the lace is not itchy but soft and very pretty i totally love it this is my new favorite top in my wardrobe,1
4144,This cardigan is defined by comfort it is of a lovely knitted like material and is very warm the pockets are great for holding your phone and the billowy sleeves make you feel like you are wrapped in a blanket,1
4145,Dress appears to be slim fit but thats far from the case usually wear an xs regular because i have a long torso for my but it just hung on me like a heavy sack i have a hard time finding dresses now that im not working and like to have a couple on hand for all purpose occasionsweddings memorials special occasions i hoped this one would meet my needs disappointed,0
4146,These are greatlooking chinos and very comfortable im andunrolledthey are long enough for me,1

4151,Love love love this top love the ruffled tiers at the bottom love the longer length the top does indeed run large normally im between a medium and small but bought the xs love the pockets the orange color seems like a nicer fabric and is versatile with both jeans and leggings,1
4152,I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the s with the red and white ruffles pass,0
4153,I typically wear a or in jeans had to size up to a in these the legs felt fine in the size but the waistband was a bit tight so i went with the s i am lbs ill also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off they are about inches longer on me compared to the model pictured,1
4154,I bought this to use over the holidays it is extremely comfortable and ive received multiple complements you can dress it up or wear it casual,1
4155,These pants are beautiful the color is a nice deep red pretty color for fall and the wide legs are very complimentary for athletic thigh women like myself my only regret is listening to the other reviewer these pants run true to size i am normally a p in elevenses and should of stayed with that but went for a because of the review claiming they run small the waist is accurate sizing the only thing running big on these pants are the width of the legs and that should be expected from th,1
4156,So disappointed bought these in a and shouldve gone with a theyre super cute i got the green the fit is off like the other reviews they stretch out way too much i would return these but have already washed them they wash terribly too there are weird fading marks all over even when washed in cold water like the tag states so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these ive been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time ive been severely,0
4157,This is a sweet little jacket i saw it in the store but was unsure because of the price but after trying it on i just fell in love the cut is really flattering the jacket does run small i really enjoy the little pop of color on the sleeves my only complaint is the buttons make me nervous because they seem to be heavy and i worry that ill lose one but only on the front the arms and back buttons seem to be just fine overall this is a fantastic buy that is great for an office setting,1
4158,I love this sports bra i do various exercises and it works great for all of them from yoga to running the floral pattern is what really drew me to get this but the quality of this bra is the best ive ever gotten i wear a b bra and the medium fits perfect,1
4159,I love western motif so i had to try this t shirt quality is greatmaterial is high quality also the length is longperfect with jeans and jacket or sweater,1
4160,I love this top it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently but often skimps on now tit definitely runs small i usually wear a in retailer tops sometimes a and the is quite fitted on me,1
4161,This is a very cute dress the sweater material is not itchy at all i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress good quality and well made i am tall and this dress falls just above my knees so for me its the perfect length i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter,1
4162,Love this jacket it is incredibly soft and expensive looking i love the details with the zippers on the sleeves and very cute lining inside the jacket which is not pictured i ordered my usual size xxsp and it fit great this brand does run small so if you are between sizes or prefer a looser fit you should order a size up,1
4163,I wear these pants days a week i work in advertising so they go perfectly with the polished trendy casual office attire that is required they are simply the most comfortable jeans i own and also make me look slimmer without looking too tight they are a unique type of material a soft but structured stretch weave so more polished than normal jeggings and smooth over bumps while still highlighting subtle curves the zippers at the bottom add an edgy polish but also provide a more,1
4164,I love the design of this cape most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater which i like it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans the constructions is well made as well,1
4165,What a great easy to wear jumpsuit i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fitsometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish comfortable and it looks amazing on,1
4166,I totally thought this was a dress when i tried it on and bought it in the store there is a drawstring on the inside to cinch the waist making it look so cute as a dress,1
4167,I noticed this dress in the highlighted area and then read the reviews i probably wouldnt have thought much about it just scrolling through the dress pages and now im so glad i bought it i have worn this dress several times and never fail to get compliments on it i know i will wear it again come next fall i am petite but ordered the regular and find that length to be perfect im a teacher and this dress helps me maintain a classy yet modern look i purchased the small usually wear size,1
4168,This top is both cute and flattering it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous i highly recommend,1
4169,Truthfully i wouldnt have looked twice at this shirt online i came across it at my local retailer store and im so glad i did the colors are more vivid and beautiful in person i purchased the small my normal size and it hits at the waist,1
4170,This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations im lbs with an athletic build and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium the material is thick high quality and the colors are exactly the way they appear online the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude i feel like i got tops in one sinc,1
4171,Beautiful piece the model actually doesnt do this piece justice it is stunning a light yet quality fabric that drapes effortlessly and ties comfortably great with a white tee and sllm jeans runs ever so slighty large but i took my normal size xs and for the type of piece it is it works,1
4172,I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip and i think itll do just fine its a wonderful opengauge knit delicate and light but substantial enough that i dont fear snagging it constantly the cloth has a nice weight and drape and while the fit is on the loose side it does look intentional wonderful as a pullover or by itself i have the minty bluegreen color and its divine definitely worth the price,1
4173,If you are in between sizes order smaller size adorable dress boots or booties look adorable with it denim jacket or dress it up can go either way colors are beautiful i ordered the small and medium and kept the small i did have it shortened for reference i am pounds,1
4174,This is a super cute style and i love it with white skinnies i purchased the gray colorway i am normally a small in tops but purchased the xs based on other reviews the xs is still pretty loose on me but i dont mind too much because i like flowy tops anyway the color is so pretty and the design is edgy it will transition to fall well,1
4175,These are so great love the fabric weight light they look great on the pictures dont do these justice i tried them on in the store with a black sleeveless crop top you couldnt see any mid skin and it looked great together might have to go back and get the top they do look great with just a black tank as well though,1
4176,Maeve really keeps me guessing on sizingusually too big but this one is too small in my normal so i went with the for comfortable movement while still maintaining the intentional fitted look fabric is of beautiful quality colors are true to the picture just a gorgeous timeless dress that i imagine wearing to many special events or with a denim jacket over it for work,1
4177,Love the dolman sleeves and its the perfect length throw on a cute necklace and go,1
4178,The fit is not as shown on the website will be returning,0
4179,I just bought this at the store i simply couldnt resist it is very light and comfortable and could easily be dressed up or dressed down sandals and a crossbody bag for exploring the city strappy healed sandals and some flashy jewelry for a garden party or day event slip on booties and a cardigan for the evening cant wait to rock it in terms of sizing i am with dd bust and some hips and booty usually i am a size m in dresses and pants but in true retailer style i ended up,1
4180,I like this sleeveless sweater it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk paired with blackwhite patterns its pretty versatile as seen in the pics a great staple for a more casual office environment being a taller girl i love the length on it and find its flattering for my curvy figure,1
4181,Great fitting and super cute my husband said this is the cutest bathing suit ive owned and i live in bathing suits,1
4182,This is stunning even more stunning in person the crochet is divine every inch of it is beautifully detailed its got a bit of weight to it and the crochet is very high quality i am normally a l or xl and i have curves this is why this unfortunately did not work for me it fits more like a shift with a little more aline room on the right shape it will be perfect if youre curvy size up if youre lean or narrow you might want to size down the length is heavenly for tall gals but wi,1
4183,I bought this in a size which is my usual retailer size the lace is nice quality not rough or scratchy i purchased the ivory which does have some blush accents which make it look vintagey it will be perfect for the holidays or all fallwinter i like that the peplum doesnt seem to flair out much very pretty,1
4184,I love this top very comfortable wear it alone or under a sweater i have the black also,1
4185,Love this coat great fall piece i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture great retailer purchase,1
4186,Oh look i have a booty and would look at thati have a waist too yes this dress is way casual for its price point soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color but its all forgiven because it fits me like a glove i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my nonhourglass body wish there were more colors available i would pick them up in a heartbeat i purchased the medium petite my stats for fit reference tall dd waist hips wide,1
4187,This dress is adorable the ruffles are a very cute detail the top is a bit transparent for the price it probably should have included something to make it less transparent but it is so cute i will just put a cami underneath runs true to size my usual xsmall fit perfect c lbs i didnt find the top to be that blousy i thought it was perfect for me,1
4188,Love love love wish i had gotten this in every color the absolute most perfect tank with just the right amount of flow i am with d chest and the medium is great,1
4189,I love this jump suit sorta looks great on but the dye rubs off on your skin i washed it and its still happening when you put your hand in your pockets they come out blue knees are blue thighs etc i looked dirty by the end of the day wish i could return it fit and look great not great after wear,0
4190,Im surprised im the first to review this dress it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion it is absolutely gorgeous it is so feminine and seductive its one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone it is a quality dress beautifully made looks just like the photo im the hemline falls at the top of my knees the neckline is exquisite really makes the dress i purchased the black version but if i was younger id get it in red as it would garner quite a bit,1
4191,This dress is horrible i cant believe they can get away with calling it a dress it should have been called a tunic or shirt it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures no way it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff it came to the top of my thighs i cant find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth,0
4192,I was a little skeptical to buy this dress at first because of the pattern in all honestly i am so happy that i did its so unique and truly a one of a kind design when tried on the dress is very slimming,1
4193,This tunic is lovely and versatile looks great over a pair of jeans or as a dress,1
4194,I wanted to love this sweater the photo of the model makes it look so soft and warm i liked the heavy texture and the extra long sleeves however after receiving this sweater i tried it on for less than minute one look in the mirror was enough to make me take it off and return it asap the knit quickly expanding from small to large right over the bust combined with the boxy shape was an atrocious combo it must have added lbs to my physique and made my bust look matronly yikes this ma,0
4195,I have not written a review for an retailer item in a while i have been shopping at retailer for over ten years in the past two years the clothing i have purchased has been disappointing in style and quality but not this little pilcro jacket great quality perfectly proportioned great understated details many thanks retailer for restoring my faith,1
4196,Im not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt i saw it instore before it became available online and knew i had to have it i dont like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt im curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine i would definitely recommend this product,1
4197,I love this shirt the neckline is flattering and the overall feel is very comfy,1
4198,This shirt is so comfortable the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue and both in different sizes so that the smaller xs is a little closer fitting and the larger s is more blouse and casual i had originally purchased both in m which also looked fine just larger and even more roomy but exchanged for the smaller sizes this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans flats leather boots o,1
4199,The only thing i did not like about this jacket was that i could not find it in my size before it sold out retailer please bring back another iteration for spring,1
4200,As another reviewer noted the upper portion back chest shoulders etc fit nicely however the body of the dress was enormous and did indeed make me look much heavier throughout the middle back to the store it goes,0
4201,This jacket is surprisingly soft and comfy id been debating getting a leather jacket in this style but when i saw this it seemed a great option seems to be very versatile,1
4202,This is one of my favorite tops it is comfortable and an easy throw and go top i am a big fan of denim tops and the lace on the back gives it that extra detail and flare very pleased,1
4203,I love the cut and style of this simple striped tank its good fabric,1
4204,Lets face it this dress isnt perfect for all body types but fits mine perfectly im it lbs i love the cut and the unfinished bottom feels very causal when need be or a little more refined when needed the zipper has a long denim piece attached to help with zipping up the denim is soft and lays nicely i suppose the fact that i got it on sale does make me love it that much more but i keep putting it on with a closet full of clothes and sun dresses in particular i still keep pu,1
4205,Love this dress i tried it on at the store and loved how it felt on i put it on hold to think about it and returned later that day to purchase i am glad i did the st day i wore it i received numerous compliments,1
4206,I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance i was hoping these would be the same i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front i have no desire to have a brasports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric it is tacky,0
4207,I love the unique design the details are wonderful it runs a bit large but it works a great piece,1
4208,Love this blouse per the previous review there was no problem with my tailoring it is exactly as shown i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the officei do think it runs a tiny bit small however it is not short its just quite a fitted piece i would consider sizing up i love the look of the medium on me,1
4209,Love love love this dress you can dress it up with high heels or down with sandals a mid weight material with seperate slip that serves as a lining i am athletic and lbs and bought a size small i have broad shoulders average waist short torso small hips and long legs in the spring a denim jacket would look perfect with this dress,1
4210,I just love the print on this shirt it is so feminine and pretty the material is very soft i took my usual medium a great addition to my spring wardrobe,1
4211,I got this dress in coral and i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on the fabric is very soft and flows nicely i am and i got it in regular but the length is not too long or short i can probably wear it with my flip flops,1
4212,Great sweater vest its not too thin or too thick just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition its easy to put on and i dont worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler highly recommend i am a b and usually wear a,1
4213,Very disappointed the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it ive only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing,0
4214,I ordered a small from the online shop knowing it would be drapey but its much more than drapey and the front draping looks like halloween costume material not chic or sophisticated sadly i will be returning this top,0
4215,I love linen i know its a pain with the wrinkles but its just a very nice crisp clean feel this vest is wonderful it fits very nice once you size down and can work as a bathing suit cover up im using it with my linen pants and skirts and everyone has asked me where did you get thati think theyre all gone by now but if they arent grab it while you can its a must have for any womans closet,1
4216,Great color and fabric a bit on the sheer side but not completely seethrough perfect for spring summer and even into fall wore it on a weekend trip to the beach with capris and then to work with a cropped blazer planning on ordering it in additional colors if its still available a good staple for your wardrobe,1
4217,I usually love bordeaux so i was very disappointed with this shirt when it arrived the fabric smelled plasticy which is a first for me with retailer products when i put the shirt on i could see it had that sheen that comes from rayon spandex blend shirts i hadnt noticed that it had spandex in it when i ordered it this fabric looks and feels exactly like the cheap blends sold at discount stores i cant believe retailer is selling this,0
4218,I reserve my star reviews for products that are made well are a good value and have great style this is one of those rare gemsthe top is just beautiful in person very lightweight almost voilelike cotton so soft and drapey and yes you will need a base layer its meant to be very sheer and the crochet and lace insets all over the top are stunning the fit is somewhere between tts and slightly oversized but the shoulders are pretty tts which means it avoids looking like youre,1
4219,Fit great hang nice extra loop to hold belt perfect design,1
4220,Love love this sweater vest quality is wonderful and the fit is great highly recommend,1
4221,I love this tunic i am weeks pregnant and the large fit great i wish it were a little longer but will be great with leggings and perfect for the fallwinter seasons,1
4222,I bought this dress in burnt orange for my yearold collage daughter she loved it and has found many opportunities to wear it on campus she said it is so comfortable and perfect with a sweater for cool fall mornings and sleeveless as the day warms up,1
4223,These pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy theyre the perfect summer pants,1
4224,I am very pleased with this purchase a nude colored racer back bra works perfectly under it and does not show through i have worn this with jean shorts and linen pants and it looks great with both it is slightly on the dressy side so i also plan to wear it to work paired with a skirt or dress pants and a cardigan i am a a and size small fits nicely,1
4225,I ordered this because the reviews were outstanding i am returning it although the embroidery looks fine on screen in person it looks cheap and tacky moreover the high ruffled neck goes a step too far into overthetop victorian cutesyoverpriced to bootobviously mine is a minority opinion,0
4226,I wanted to love this shirt its not my usual style buy it looked so great online unfortunately the actual shirt is much more brown in color and design than i thought looking online im fair coloring it just wasnt flattering im thin but have a larger chest and this style just wasnt right for me could definitely be cute on someone else but not a good match for me,0
4227,This one arrived at my store and was sold out in two days everyone loves it the fabric is a woven material very light a little sheer but comfortable and really airy it has a bit of weight to it so it doesnt stick at all which is a win for me the colors are perfectly neutral this is as long as it looks in the photos tunic length and i love it i am and it hits below my toosh loved wearing this with leggings and jacket or pairing it with denim i adore it and im so glad i grabbed,1
4228,This is totally different great addition to my wardrobe,1
4229,I absolutely love this sweater its soft and delicate i bought a green one which flatters my skin tone i feel that i can wear it for three seasons except summer lolit runs a bit large i normally wear size medium for tops from retailer but the size s of this sweater fits better than size m the sleeves are bit long than other sweaters but i think thats the style as shown on the modelif you like feminine and romantic topssweaters you will like this piece,1

4231,Gorgeous dress love that its flowy soft and fits very well it does run a size smaller i usually wear a and went with a p one this one the sleeves are a bit tighter on the petite than the regular in the same size,1
4232,I have to be honest i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool it is extremely lightweight and comfortable making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat and the style is fabulous love the hassles and beads on the ties,1
4233,This dress is gorgeous pictures online do not do it justice my only issue is that it is slightly sheer even with the layers under the skirt will probably require nude boy shorts i would say it runs tts if not a little bit large i ordered my normal size and the band and bust are snug but not uncomfortable but the back mesh portion is loose it hits me about where it hits the model in length i was able to find one that somebody returned instore so that was helpful for reference i am,1
4234,Cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it if you look really close in the photo you can see it,0
4235,The details and colors are exquisite stop hesitating and get this dress,1
4236,Tried these on out of sheer curiosity ive got a long torso was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are they manage to look flowing sleek without shortening the legs took a size with my waist hips its a bit of a generous fit especially around the waist but theyre extremely comfortable have room to tuck tops into i have the cowled sweater tank in gray it looks fantastic over these couldnt resist getting both the rust and black perfect for a dressy casual look,1
4237,So i really loved this dress i am tall ft and the size was perfect length i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals i would say it is true to size i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of flow without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack the back is just gorgeous and unique here is why i couldnt make it mine the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin there is literally not much to it and im not sure it wou,0
4238,I wore this out to a dinnerparty that was thrown for me and people loved the surprise back i have a few lace back shirts but this one is gorgeous and sexy i am incredibly cautious about the lace however it is so delicate no issues but just be careful,1
4239,Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store howeverending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,0
4240,I saw this dress at my local retailer and passed it the first time one week later i stopped by and skimmed through the store and went back to the dressand decided to try it on boy oh boy i grabbed a small and a medium i usually wear a medium and the small fit perfectly the fabric is thick and feels so soft and nice i love the pockets worth the splurge and like the other reviewer said its not maternity like at all i plan to wear it with brown boots or brown heels,1
4241,The blouse is absolutely beautiful i am and the length is perfect even though it fit a little snug across the chest its a keeper ill wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath,1
4242,This piece was so gorgeous that i bought it despite how impractical it is to wear it in honolulu its honestly the perfect little number to wear if you want to go for a late autumnearly winter stroll in the city its incredibly comfortable and versatile ive worn it on cool mornings in honolulu as a dress with booties and a few months ago i wore it to minneapolis and added leggings and a warm pea coat depending on how you choose to accessorize the look it can be casual or professional i,1
4243,This top is comfort wear or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer that said it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable,1
4244,This is an adorable top i had to have it in both colors it has a unique shape to it and the simple details give it so much appeal the beautiful fall like colors can be layered easily into the cooler weather of the season,1
4245,I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical i love this dress,1
4246,Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely i am like it states the model is and it falls shorter on me that viewed but still looks nice it will be an easy dress to use for different looks,1
4247,Love this tshirti will be wearing this until it wears out very soft great fit and very comfortable,1
4248,Absolutely love this top followed reviewer advice to size down and got the medium good choice and probably could have gotten a small love the fabric and pattern its so light and pretty love the marriage of bare shoulders with sleeves,1
4249,I had to write a review on this one because i am obsessed with it it is the softest and yummiest sweater ever and i plan on wearing it constantly,1
4250,Cute sweater snap was broken when i received it and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock ugh,0
4251,Love the coat style and fit are a perfect fit true to sizethanks for the previous reviews about the button i am extra careful taking it on and off versatile take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you,1
4252,I read all the reviews and they were very helpful the waist does run small so i sized up which was perfect i love how this skirt is lightweight and swingy i cant get enough comfortable denim skirts so size up and you will love this i am a slightly hippy girl and the skirt did not make me look big at all,1
4253,This tunic has really cute detail it is hard to see in online photos but there is dark brownish beading over the embroidery the fabric is not as soft as i would have liked but its still a keeper because of the two patterns embroidery and beading also it is long and does run large but i think the measurements given in the description are accurate it is a tunic after all i ordered an xs petite and it will be very cute with leggings and boots,1
4254,The color was very different and vibrant chose to size up for extra room and length,1
4255,Seafolly is my favorite brand in swimwear ive collected a few over the years i was so happy to find this print the little umbrellas are so cute and fun i am normally a size in seafolly and this one ran true to size,1
4256,I loved this sweater it is a little thin so i will probably wear a tank under it but you could probably get away without one i am normally either an xs or a small and i got the xs in this sweater the bottom is a little loose like in the models photo but i really like it,1
4257,Beautiful and comfy love it,1
4258,I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different but these werent issues for me the color is navy it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress which i think is nice no one likes a limp bow the belt is nothing to write home about but it ties the dress together nicelythe front pocket is different but i really like it i had a hard time conceptualizing it before,1
4259,I was so excited for this dress to come i am quot and lbs so i ordered and xs petite it was literally falling down around my shoulders and gigantic all around maybe on someone taller this would have looked great i was also disappointed that the blue shown online was not accurate my dress was a much lighter blue back to the store it goes,0
4260,Super cute style but runs slightly larger then other ag jeans i have,1
4261,This was absolutely adorable on it does look a bit like a dress but at and lbs i am normally a size and needed the in this it fit so perfectly i didnt consider the petite i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down only draw back is dry clean only super cute and i definitely recommend this cuter in person and on,1
4262,I saw this dress online this morning went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it i love this brand because the designs are modest but feminine and practical this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery the fit is tts and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug the length is just above my knee at i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies,1
4263,I bought this very cute tshirt in sky wore it once then washed it according to the washing instuctions machine washabledryable this tshirt turned into a crop top i cant wear it its going to goodwill i would suggest that you air dry this shirt if you want to take the chance that it wont shrink up several inches,0
4264,Love the shirt exteemely comfortable simple and nice,1
4265,Lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store the sleeves are not big,1
4266,Lovely dress iampampm wearing it with a blue denim jacket and brown suede boots it is most certainly purple a little more so than the picture still love it,1
4267,Very cute dress for or taller,1
4268,I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it it does not smell nor does it itch as the other reviewer stated at least not for me i was worried about the green color but its quite lovely this is a keeper for me i am but ordered the regular xs and i am happy with the length,1
4269,A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look,1
4270,This dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did perfect dress for work and going out the petite hits me midthigh like in the photo,1
4271,This skirt is gorgeous sturdy well constructed i was afraid the midi length would look frumpy but it was beautiful it has a nice lining flares into a pretty a line and has a pull tab belt around the waist to cinch it a bit i am normally a and i bought the it was a bit big but the belt helped with that i wore it for my bridal shower and got many compliments,1
4272,From unique shape to feminine design this cropped summer sweater is the kind of item that attracted me to retailer thirteen years ago its also flattering especially for this petite who doesnt like to show her upper arms,1
4273,The back of this tshirt looks cute but the front looks really weird the material in the back is quite stiff but the grey material is soft so the front gray area ends up hanging weirdly and looking uneven and messy i appreciate asymmetrical clothing but to me it looked like a patched up rag from the front it fits true to size,0
4274,Beautiful dress perfect mid length dress for the colder months i tried a size regular first my normal dress size but it was a little baggy so the fit perfectly,1
4275,This pink tank is a wonderful addition to my goto basics i love the color which is a nice deep pink that is pretty spot on in terms of accuracy to the online photo it is a wonderful comfy fabric and the side knot adds nice visual interest to make this top appealing and unique i also appreciate the wide straps which means i can wear a normal bra instead of a strapless one without worrying about straps playing peekaboo the only drawback is size i ordered my usual xs i am lbs,1
4276,Fits perfectly i dont think this is too long and im a shorty great style wish it came in more colors i would definitely buy again,1
4277,Dress is pretty and works are a tunic too im short but the fabric does not overwhelm me,1
4278,Soft and cozy every day tee that can be dressed up or worn casually only compliant is i wish it came in more colors,1
4279,Bought this dress in store after trying it on loved it its sexy with the lower cut front the fabric is flowy and breathable runs true to size usually wear a with my hips but the fit better on topthe sides are well designed so your bra doesnt show im g size jeans and athletichourglass built i cant wait to wear it out the pictures dont do it justice,1
4280,This dress is unique and lovely it is a one of a kind dress i found it to be true to size the only downside is the quality of the buttons,1
4281,I love this sweater its so soft and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it it runs true to size but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more it seems to stretch a little overall i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it,1
4282,I am in love with these jeans i cant say enough about them they are so forgiving yet keep their shape great they are soft comfortable and are a great color these jeans have the perfect amount of stretch while being substantial and durable,1
4283,I love this top the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering its so pretty the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasnt too short i highly recommend this top,1
4284,These white jeans are super cute the longer length is perfect for tall ladies who can still roll them up you can also adjust the height of the cuff since it is not preattached to the jeans i will wear them all the time,1
4285,I pretty much am in agreement with the first original reviewer on here big disappointment especially if you have hips and are bustypros great breathable fabric cute look overall sash in front brings it all together buttons are hidden under a panel of fabric which is a nice touchcons runs very small in the bust normally i can wear a or with most of retailers stuff i tried on a and it fit everywhere with entirely too much room i,0
4286,Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days classic red and black check with a fashion flair great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry a great find,1
4287,Love this top i bought it in colors its a great twist on a basic tee love love love,1
4288,This top is perfect for a weekend casual look you will love this it fits true to size,1
4289,I had such high hopes for this blouse as it looks totally stunning online however its not as pictureddescribed in that it is totally sheer and the brand is not floreat but rather hd in paris for the price the quality is just not thereive seen comparable shirts at other stores for much less i returned it without a second thought,0
4290,Like another reviewer i recently had a baby and ordered this to hide my belly the m fits perfectly without looking too large and the sleeves fit me just fine i love the thicker fabric and his is he perfect length for leggings,1
4291,I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small d at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldnt even know its not real leather the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and its so neat how it goes with so many outfits the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to its,1
4292,This is a gorgeous print but i found it too fussy for my taste it is quite shapeless so i tried doing a half tuck it looked cute for about seconds but then i had to worry about keeping the shoulders down,0
4293,Alas i so wanted to love this the photos of the models wearing it look gorgeous flowy drapey ultimate grecian goddess but it just doesnt work unless youre superskinny too much material almost bulky strange looking the print is so beautiful i love the pink floral and i love the whole idea of the dress but it just doesnt work have to send it back im pounds and i ordered a,0
4294,Bought this camitank on sale which im glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fittedit kinda just drapes under the camithe problem is its not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed throughthat was higher than the bottom of my chest so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong braundergarmentit simply looks awkward not sure if it wouldve been better,0
4295,I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag it seemed huge i wear both l and xl depending on the sizing when i tried it it did look like the photo its meant to be a little voluminous the arms were a little snug so sizing down was out of the question it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design which is just a teeny bit off the lace is delicate too btw so care will be needed not to snag it,1
4296,I have been thinking about getting this dress for a while but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack but i am so glad i got it and so glad my usual size was not available typically im a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite while still flowy i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down i cant wait to wear it definitely consider sizing down,1
4297,One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable you can tie them as loose or tight as you like like other reviewers mentioned the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing i am lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp i have never worn petites before so i dont know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger but i definitely have neede,1
4298,It was quite a bit shorter on me than what it shows on the model who is the same height the pullon styling is a fail as i could barely get my head through the neck opening i was afraid it might rip a seam the fabric seems low quality like it would stretch out and degrade faster than others overall not the dress or quality i expected,0
4299,This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric the photo really doesnt do it justice i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants its a stunner,1
4300,When i tried on this dress my husbands jaw dropped to the ground it is so unique and so beautiful on however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed i am a size and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen buy this,1
4301,I wanted so badly to love this dress but i couldnt get past the thin material that you can actually see through not for this price anyhow the dress is shorter than i had anticipated and more fitted around the waistline flaring out at the bottom which i feel isnt accurately portrayed in the photo on the positive though the color is beautiful and the neck line stunning but alas will be returning,0
4302,I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments very unique design,1
4303,like others i agree that this is a staple that will pair with many many outfits it is really wellconstructed classic comfortable and a wonderful length for us taller gals as you can see from my stats im rather tall at so its hard to find,1
4304,These are very fun and breezy pants i first ordered a medium but the waist was too low i exchanged for a large and i love the fit now i like them loose and airy for reference i am usually a petite and the l regular is super cute i hope they wash well they are perfect for the hot and humid northern va summer,1
4305,The lokka tunic is a perfect goto top for casual days or nights pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set the long sleeves are fitted and longso they can be bunched at the wrist i ordered it in both the black and the the pale greyblue shade it is a winner,1
4306,What more could you want than a dress that slips on easily hugs all the right places and skims the others feels like pajamas and looks great for any occasion i am about dd usually a petite i ordered the petite small in navy and it fits just like the model photos i tried it on in the store in a regular small and xsmall and could have gone with either but the petite had better proportions especially where the vneck hit i would have had to wear a very low plunge bra wi,1
4307,This skirt is really adorable but only if youre going to tuck in your tops the pockets flare out at the top so shirts dont lay correctly on them instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy tucked in though super cutethe waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of i usually take a pant or jean i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling ill be exchanging for a small hopefully t,1
4308,I love this dress i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip it is beautiful and is so comfy it looks good with heels or sandals i definately recommend this dress it would look good on any body type,1
4309,This is one of my all time favorite retailer purchases this dress is perfect in every way mine fits me exactly like the model and i was lucky enough to purchase it in black if youre on the fence take the plunge and buy this dress you wont be disappointed,1
4310,This dress runs large so i sized down when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on i love it it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look i get complements on it everytime i wear it my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit,1
4311,I ordered this as a gift and may order myself one it is so comfortable and pretty,1
4312,Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack washed them according to directions and they were ruined the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled definitely going to try to return these,0
4313,I tried this jumpsuit on in the store and loved it but decided to wait on purchasing it after it went on sale i jumped on it because i new i would regret not buying it i am tall but most of my height is from my long legs not in my torso i seldom find jumpsuits that fit my frame but his one fits perfectly the fabric is very flowey and does not wrinkle the overall design of this jumpsuit is slightly but not overly baggy the pattern and pleating make it a perfect item for spring and su,1
4314,These pants are very cute for springsummer and i enjoy having the option of a looser silhouette with a bit of length nearly all of my pants are a cropped skinny these days i agree with the other reviews that have described the leg as being less straightlegged than they are pictured on me they have a subtle flare nothing major but just enough to break perfectly over my shoe they fit tts on me but i did need to have the hem taken up im lbs and the p fits perfectly i hav,1
4315,Such a great purchase it can be dressed up or down and seems to go with everything great for summer,1
4316,Love this dress thought the colors would be too much but it actually isnt and is just so cute got a ton of compliments on it when i wore it the material is light but not see through at all the length is perfect and comfortable to sit around in this will be my go to dress this fall,1
4317,Im and small frame but took a chance and ordered the m so gladthe fit was perfect the robe is soft and beautiful,1
4318,I loved these pants super soft and cozy and perfect for winter ive worn them a handful of times and have washed them maybe twice max and they already have holes they dont say handwash and my washerdryer is brand new and pretty gentle on my clothes maybe i just ended up with a bad pair but i found the quality to be disappointing,0
4319,This dress is indeed so lovely in person i am so glad i ordered sizes p and p based on the straighterlooking cut i am lbs adn dd bra size verdict the p fit better why the cehst area is a little snug and hte buttons kept trying to open and did i would have ahd to leave it pen and wear a tank under this dress not an option with such a unique pieceother things color wow very nice in person i was afraid that the colr would wash me out but no i have very p,1
4320,I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort quality and design it is a little short but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirtcamisole the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up i usually wear a xs or s in retailers clothes but i sized up to a m on this one definitely worth it this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o,1
4321,Love it to layer it is not heavy the perfect weight soft material my daughters all want to steal it,1
4322,These are awesome i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color they are beautiful and very nice quality they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering,1
4323,Very cute shorts sadly after one wash they became a lint magnet so had to be returned disappointing quality,1
4324,I love how unique this top is especially the buttons that run on the backit is cut boxy but i think it works because there is so much other detail going on the fabric is comfortable and the stitching on the inside is not irritating,1
4325,Beautiful and comfortable although it is a lot looser at the bottom than pictured and the slit on the sides is quite high not deal breakers though,1
4326,Tried this on just for fun today and ended up taking it home in the glorious blue many have commented on the sizing issue for reference i am lbs a slender athletic build i bought a size and it fits like a dream no large arm holes no gaping buttons and the length is perfect yes it will wrinkle its linen thats part of the look i feel this will fill a void in my closet that was missing i was wearing flat ankle wrap espadrilles when i tried it on and it looked super cute,1
4327,Bought this shirt on sale it was super cute in the dressing room and for the first time i wore it washed it per the instructions wash delicate with cold water lay flat to dry and it shrunk so much i dont think im going to be able to wear it anymore it was oversized and loose when i bought it so it shrunk a lot there is also a small hole all of the sudden that i have no idea where it came from wasnt there when i put it in the washer very disappointed,0
4328,Its a sweatshirt that isnt typically sweatshirt looking first its spacedye then theres the hilo hem its mock neck and its wide neck sleeves are low and cocoony its oversize in looks but not overwhelming i love that i can throw this on over jeans or leggings step into a pair of flats or trainers whip my hair up into a bun and head out without looking too sloppy,1
4329,Hi these are really nice the material is thick they will probably be warm in the heat they are made of polyester if they were made out of linen they would be perfect,1
4330,Love this top it is a little big through the bodywaist i thought it would be a little more fitted but i still love it the bow really makes the shirt,1
4331,This top takes every other tee and blows it out of the water it appears subtle on the hanger but it looks so lady like on the flutter sleeve are darling the top does have a lot of volume but the drape is so lovely it adds some shape it is perfect to wear everyday and dress up i bought to wear with the bryden skirt for reference i purchased ordered the xs though i am wearing a s in the photo and i am c waist the shoulder fit okay with easter size but there was a little less v,1
4332,I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything im size and the large fit just right,1
4333,Super cute will be buying another color of this tee,1
4334,I purchased this for travel for a work meeting i paired black slim pants under with heelsi added a long simple necklace and it was perfection after getting a little wrinkled in my suitcase i simply hung up while i showered and the wrinkles fell right outit was comfortable traveled well was light but looked very professional you could wear tights under with boots or i can see in the spring with fun nude shoesdolan always hits a home run every dolan piece i have i still wear years l,1
4335,Love the color and length of these shorts i have been searching for a pair of dark denim shorts that were not cutoffs and these pilcro shorts are winning fit great like all pilcro denim and im sure i will be getting a lot of wear ie every day out of these shorts,1
4336,I love these pants i have them in the black and green they are comfortable and look great on my curvy figure i am lbs and got the size,1
4337,Ive been waiting to purchase this top for some time thinking it would be perfect weight for fallwinter im pretty disappointed since i dont live close to an retailer i typically order a size up to avoid returns and usually end up with items that fit just right or a little loose which is no big deal this sweater however i was swimming in like a child in an adult sweater it was huge and not to mention unflattering on my short fuller shape i wasnt impressed with the material either it f,0
4338,I was so surprised to find this in the sale it is beautiful light and airy while lined the color is bright and fun it is so comfortable i ordered an xs based on reviews this is my typical size in this type of style and it fit great i ordered the regular length even though i am only i am about will be an easy go to skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up did i mention comfortable,1
4339,The knit collar and the color and the drape is what makes this lilitz cardigan so wonderful and an excellent addition to my signature retailer sweater collection as previous reviewers stated the color is not orange but more of a marled rose yarn the body of the sweater is lightweight draped stretchy and warm and the knit collar is much heavier because of my body type ddd heavy upper back rounded shoulders this cardigan doesnt look great on me when left open as the collar doesnt fall,1
4340,I loved this top but the cut was too short in the waist for my frame wish it came in a tall size,0
4341,I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely it is a soft soft fabric almost fleecelike but not plush,1
4342,The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink colori took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra it is a rather loose fit so if you prefer something more form fitting you might opt for a smaller size,1
4343,Very cute and well made fits true to size,1
4344,So much to love about this dress the color is exactly as pictured in the video not photos the fabric is substantial beautiful colors the dress is well constructed back zipper and is easy to put on and take off it is not only lined but has a crinoline built in to the liner its not super puffy just enough to give it some flare i am b lbs and bought a it fits me perfectly the shoulders are a smidge too big but not enough for me to have them taken up just yet oh and i,1
4345,This blouse is lovely i ordered a large because so many blouses run small for me but am returning for a medium as it fits pretty loose i love the tie its unique and feminine,1
4346,Perfect crop jeans with just a tiny flare im a size and the s fit perfectly,1
4347,I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order great fit and cut with a hint of stretch nice styling details great vintage color i wasnt in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come,1
4348,I was looking for a stylish springfall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me i cant wear it enough i am a short but d and have waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room i am normally a so i was surprised by this if you are on the,1

4351,These are so much better than i anticipated they are lightweight for summer the perfect length im and they are just right with a wedge and very flattering i will be living in these all summer long i agree with the other reviewer who felt the catalog picture misrepresented them they do not have a technicolor sheen at all rather they are a beautiful classic chambray,1
4352,Wanted to like this top but it looks terrible and does not lay right the bust line is not tight enough to contrast the rest of the top being flowy does not give any shape to the body do not recommend for anyone with a medium to large chest,0
4353,Surprisingly flattering on especially with pantsjeans extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws the pleating enhances the bust the vcut provides a touch of a peekaboo not enough to show cleavage but its there in a super flattering way the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office under a jacket or just plain for going out the material is not too thick but not,1
4354,I bought this dress for work and receive tons of compliments when i wear it the material is soft and breathable which makes it comfortable to wear all day at work with a light jacket i do agree with the other reviewer though it does show every bump especially in the tummy i also noticed that some of the fabric flaps will flip up when i sit down but i am going to sew the flap down so it stops doing that,1
4355,I am petite and i ordered the xxsp i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinnyslim pants or leggings i do not think it runs that large it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model i got the gray print and it is quite pretty,1
4356,I had to have this when i saw it in a store i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors i wore it for the first time today with a black tank on me it looks best unbuttoned it looks good with pants the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms i have muscles so i dont think i could wear it with any top with sleeves,1

4358,After readying the reviews of this dress i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner boy was i wrong first this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o one size fits all sizing it did not embrace my curves at all the material was not as chic as i would have thought overall the entire dress was not flattering honestly i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it,0

4362,I swooned over this dress when it first came online i had never worn a petite size before so i wasnt sure about the fit i am curvy dd and normally wear a size dress but the p fit me like it was made for my body i think this is because the dress runs large but i really really enjoyed the fit the quality of the lace is evident immediately and the color is more of a cornflower blue which i adore the lace feels like a soft cotton but has a lot of strength to it cannot recomme,1

4365,So often you find dresses in a cool breathable material like rayon or silk but the manufacturer lines it in hot nonbreathable polyester which leaves you sweating on a hot summer day or night thankfully someone at antropologie knows what theyre doing and this gorgeous silk dress is lined in rayon thank you to that personyes this dress is a bit on the short side with its modest neckline it looks like it could be great for work but it does hit a bit above the knee so if you wo,1

4374,I absolutely love everything about this top i bought it in the taupenavy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer the neckline and sleeves seem tailorfitted for my body i dont often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect lengthshape to be incredibly flattering theyre in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regularlength the neckline is eq,1

4377,The print layers and fit of this dress remind me of the s but in a good way the outer dress is voluminous and flowy so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top i really appreciate that styling detail dd and i chose medium regular length not petite since im older and wanted the length,1

4379,How has nobody reviewed these pants yet love them theyre more like really nice structured leggings but thick enough to be substantial pants theyre stretchy hold their shape flattering on my big hips and thighs and have no distracting elements like belt loops or protruding pockets like some of my other pants which makes it hard to keep a smooth silhouette under a longer shirt the only badand it wasnt even really that badis that these are longer than the advertised im,1
4380,Love everything about this jacket its super soft thin and looks great its versatile and a great layering piece for someone that lives in a very warm climate prefer the sleeves to be worn rolled up and the inside belt definitely helps give the piece more shape and dimension,1

4384,I ordered this top in ivory in sizes because im in between and it looks so great in the photos and didnt want to risk it selling out while i debated sizing i really loved the larger size because the material is not stretchy and i didnt want the sleeves to be tight when i move it is somewhat boxy on the seam at the waist so im having it taken in a little so it fits more like a peplum and flares adding a skinny belt just didnt distribute the excess fabric as i envisioned it really is a,1

4386,The design and fabric on this suit are even more gorgeous in person than online i am and between and ordered a medium the thing i especially like about this suit is that it has adequate cup size and support i am a c or d depending on the bra and this suit is very flattering and provides nice coverage and cup support the straps can be shortened if you want a little more bust support the material and design of the suit itself feel substantial and even without the straps it do,1
4387,If you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person i bet you arent going to be happy with it for a phisique that is and lbs this dress is not too short however the back key hole design is just not flattering i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so,0
4388,Great dress i ordered the extra small petite and it fits perfectly,1
4389,First of all this skirt is as cute on as it is in the picture very flattering i am a curvy gal on the bottom and this is flattering that being said it runs small i purchased a large which is my usual size and i need another inch or two all over to make it work part of the problem is the material it is a very heavy durable upholstery like material there is absolutely no give to this it is a very stiff material as well more what i would expect on a sofa than on my skirt the skirt c,0
4390,Great shirt more of a stretch to it than i thought it would very flowy looks great with jeans leggings,1
4391,Very soft cozy and exactly what is needed on tbose inbetween days the collar is a bit dramatic if you are petite but there is an extra button that makes it more manageable stylish cute,1
4392,Bought this dress to wear for my engagement brunch it does run big but its a laid back dress to weari never had to adjust the dress of myself while wearing it,1
4393,I saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers its super comfy i bought with the intention of wearing it out not just around the house i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it ive been opting for tights lots of compliments so far i got a small because i didnt want it to be too short it fits well,1
4394,When i saw this online i knew id have to order it fastits just gorgeous i got it in the mail today and couldnt be happier im usually xs in angel of the north sweaters and this was no exception it fit great colors are as pictured,1
4395,Saw this in my local and retailer store and had to have it well made and easy to dress up for down perfect with a light weight shirt tucked in for summer and early fall i recommend sizing up one size,1
4396,Im not normally one to spend on a dress from retailer but when this dress arrived in the mail it was a nobrainer that i would keep it it hangs beautifully on your body and the fabric is extremely comfortable the tie at the waist is really flattering and the neckline adds a little bit of fun i imagine it can go from season to season pretty easily springtime with a cardigan and flats summer with wedges fall with tights and boots i love pieces that can serve different purposes a,1
4397,Love this dress its even prettier in person i found the sizing a little bit on the large side but i read that many others had the opposite problem particularly in the bust where im smallaverage for my size even though its a little big on me it looks and feels great,1
4398,This top is beautiful and im in lovebut itd huuuuggge im always a large in retailer tops im going to return for a med or maybe even a small which is unheard of for me quality is great get it just size down,1
4399,The fabric is divine its a thin polyester knit that just floats on your body its soft and drapes wonderfully its like wearing a nightgown the styling is so sexy it looks really alluring but its actually just a plain ol tank top with a bit of a sleeve dangling at the elbows its very modest reallythe silly thing is it tickles yeah those dangling ties tickle your arms when you move loli bought the grey in a xl and the fit is perfect it says dark grey but its really l,1
4400,I am happy with my decision to buy this dress its casual comfortable and my favorite color too this product is true to size color and the material feels great,1
4401,On any given day i can usually find tons of stuff i like at retailer but every once in a while comes an item that is extra specialit has adorable details lovely print fits beautifully and cant be found anywhere else oh and the quality is good this top is it for mei love the print and the sleeves remind me a bit of a kimono except that this tops fabric is smooth and flowyi tried the top in the store in a small and i felt lost in the fabric i am and small on,1
4402,I bought these in the mustard color and the salmon color i didnt have a problem with general fading but used natural mild stain remover biokleen and the pants were ruined one faded where i sprayed and the other has a permanent water mark cold wash and line dried such a bummer that these pants arent every day wearable and washable,0
4403,The skirt is totally see through unless you wear a slip even though it has a built in slip it is still see through the problem is that the slip is made out of the same super thin polyester material as the outside skirt if it wasnt see through i would keep it,0
4404,This is a very nice quality tshirt i loved the material colors i got it on sale and the only reason i had to return it because it was small on me due to the nice sale another size was not available,1
4405,This shirt is more beautiful in person it has a lovely hand feel soft and the blue is as shown but a bit more vibrant i bought it for my year old niece she loved it she may have to return for a small but i do feel the size ran true to size it depends on how you want to wear it,1
4406,I have this wonderful sweater coat in three sizes sspm in the coral green,1
4407,I disagree with other reviewers on this it looks a lot better in picture on the model i found it to run large and not fit in the most flattering way fabric feels great i want to love it but it is going back,0
4408,I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse the purple version but the design is terrible for me its boxy i didnt like the fabric and the arm ruffles are bizarre its going back tomorrow,0
4409,I agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere my shape got totally lost and i looked huge the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me as well possibly great for pregnancy because you look like your about months anyway,0
4410,Love these funky jeans they are a little baggy like boyfriend jeans i wore them with a linen white tee and wore them dressed up with a silk top and boots for casual friday they are versatile love these jeans,1
4411,I dont usually go for the tenty cut in a blouse but this one has such pretty detail and with a little cardy looks great love the black and white detail and embroidery,1
4412,This is a great alternative to a vest it does have some blue in it as the other review mentions i gave it less of a rating due to the potential for snags i am keeping it though for the sale price,1
4413,I tried this on left went back put it on hold then finally took the plunge i had a hard time justifying the price not really a functional coat too warm to be a shirt but so unique i had to have it i got the sm boxy in a good way got it yesterday with the antro members off,1
4414,This coat is a beauty the embroidery is much prettier irl and the wool is not itchy at all best of all is the tailoring as i am very petite and i am so tired of all the shapeless sacklike coatsjackets it fits tts and has pockets it is perfect just wish retailer has more offerings like this,1
4415,I got the taupe and loved it so much i ordered the white and wore both this week alone they are so cute and a great weight in this springsummer weather were having in the bay area the taupe is a normal medium and a bit roomy so ordered the white in a medium petite and its pretty great just depends upon how you like to wear it both are lovely my advice get two today you wont regret it order your regular size dont size up or down,1
4416,I saw a photographer wearing this at a wedding i went to in october i absolutely fell in love it is beautiful i cant wait to wear it for the holidays i got the small petite and i am lbs fit great enjoy,1
4417,Great basic skirt to have it flows beautifully and the print is a classic with a twist it can be dressed up or down with heels or flats a great addition to my wardrobe,1
4418,So i love this top i got it in black and red both are amazing and go with about anything they run a bit large i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry i would say it shrunk at most beyond that no difference in fact it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big obviously if you do not dry clean this you are going against manufacturer recommendations but i,1
4419,I love this design so much and it is very well made i also like the adjustable shoulder straps and that the cups are not padded cups i think that makes it look less like a bra and more like a bathing suit only con is that it seems to run small,1
4420,I ordered the purple in size xl the fit on me matches the model so i think its true to size i wouldnt say theres much purple to this print i cant really find any the areas where the bluered overlap just look navy the photos show how it really looks its a great mix of light brown peach white red and different shades of blue there will be variations because of pattern placement i love this styleits very comfortable,1
4421,I ordered this top online during the mothers day sale thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good but the problem is that the top comes with an underlayer up top this is normally a good thing extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee,0
4422,Usually wear stevie jeans from ag but wanted to try something different now i love farrah,1
4423,I tried this dress on in an xs petite the dress runs slightly bigger it sort of looked like a tent on me whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts the other thing is that the dress just doesnt look like an almost dress the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too it isnt sewn in though and it was folding down under the arms making it look like its ripping off the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center as if the material was too heavy to stand its we,0
4424,Its way more distressed than it looks in the picture and that was a no for me,0
4425,Love this sweater it is very simple but pretty it has a very flattering fit and is comfortable,1
4426,I love this jacket can dress it up or dress it down over a dress skirt or jeans very soft and flattering,1
4427,I love this tunic i am typically an xxs petite so i should have known that the regular xs would be too large but i took a chance on it unfortunately it was in fact much too large it is too bad because i absolutely love it the fabric is soooo soft and comfy i ordered it in the blue and it is prettier than pictured this is a great dress for the beach or poolside or just knocking around if you live in a hot climate or take warmweather vacations i highly recommend this it takes up ve,1
4428,This dress is cuter is person than online but it has one huge issue there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open it fell off the minute i tried to undo it i cant believe these other reviewers didnt have the same problem or maybe they put a snap there instead too bad,0
4429,I got this in black and its a great basic tshirt the vneck is just right in depth and the material is very soft and lightweight the fit is good the back is long which can be good or notsogood depending on how you want to wear it i really like the la t shirts because the material has a nice soft drape and they seem to fit exceptionally well,1
4430,I love this dress and on sale its a total steal its true to size and beyond comfortable i live in az so i can easily wear this year round i got the black color and love it im and it hits a little above my knees love the loose feminine swing i feel like skipping wearing this dress,1
4431,Thanks for the tip to size down i am typically a m or a l d and i sized down to a s it is perfectly structured and warm and soft and beautiful got it on the percent of sale items so the price was right absolutely a classic i got the plum color thanks retailer for another wardrobe staple,1
4432,I ordered an xxs online and its still massive the only thing i can use it for is a beach coverup the embroidery is pretty but i will be returning,0
4433,I really wanted to like this its soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue but thats where the positives end i ordered the xs and it was huge wide shapeless and way too long im lbs and even if it came in petite im not sure its worth the price because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out,0
4434,I am normally a size p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up i went with the p and even with a d bust had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully the band is a tad loose but any tighter wouldnt have fit in the bust this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering especially for those of us with an athletic build,1
4435,I love this dress it is so comfortable and elegant at the same time i try to not buy dry clean only pieces but i had to make an exception here perfect for early spring days,1
4436,I was returning some things when i saw these jeans and had to try them on they must be magical pants because they are slimming and very flattering amazing jeans,1
4437,I just bought this skirt in the store and im happy with it it can be dressed up or down it is made of washable silk so it doesnt require dry cleaning but it should be hand washed or on delicate cycle obviously it fits through the hips without being overly clingy the waist is a wide stretchy smocking style so there is some give,1
4438,Absolutely adorable i must object to previous reviewers who have stated that the top fits nothing like that of the model in the photo i have found that it fits exactly like that look i usually wear xl but bought this one in large as the price was too good to pass up this top affords the slightly slouchy look on top thanks to the dolman sleeves but with a bit more fit or i should saywith a bit better fit through the midriff than that of the model one reviewer stated this top make,1
4439,I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special i just love it it can be dressed up or worn with jeans it runs a bit wide i normally dont buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular,1
4440,I love all my retailer clothes its my favorite store i even love the displays,1
4441,This is a gorgeous blouse but it runs small in my opinion i consistently wear a size in moulinette soeurs and im trying to decide if a will still be too small and if i need to exchange for a construction and materials are lovely just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse,1
4442,A lovely soft material with a subtle aqua pattern im very fussy about seams that fit my waist and this one fit perfectly,1
4443,Tis is a soft soft cotton shirt that is comfortable and cute its a great top to use put on and go im looking forward to wearing it often,1
4444,I love this dress i am usually a size but ordered this in size and it fits perfect great for any season and can dress up or dress down the pink is the perfect shade i feel like im elle woods,1
4445,When i saw this top online i thought id love it and immediately ordered it in both colors they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed i have never seen such drab colors the blue is a muddy grayish hue like an overcast day and the pink is a dusty shade of peach yuck and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffonlike flowy effect instead the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit back these go,0
4446,I absolutely adore this dress i was nervous to try it because i just had a baby thinking that the waist tie looked potentially bulkystiff based on the images i am so glad i gave this a shot it is actually one of the few dresses that i am comfortable wearing right now the tie helps make me look like i have a waist even though i dont right now while covering up some of the leftover baby weight i grabbed this is my usual size s b and found it to fit perfectly plus the t,1
4447,Very comfortable to sleep in doesnt bunch up or twist love this,1
4448,The flower print really caught my eye i like the unique twisted neckline there is a lot of material here but it hangs nicely without billowing out like some other unfortunate tops,1
4449,The linen fabric is elegantly thin feels and looks lovely,1
4450,It does run large i got it on sale and it is a great sweater coat for i would not have paid the full price of but i do love it every time i wear it someone complements me,1
4451,I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review it is surprisingly flattering i am feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me but this somehow did without making me look bulky given my height it comes to ab,1
4452,I was so excited to receive this topped then i tried it on i am a petite and i normally wear an xs so i ordered it in both a size and a size it was huge it looked like i was wearing a potato sack i really wanted it to work because the fabric is absolutely beautiful i am so disappointed,0
4453,The tank is very structured thick yet breathable not see through the coral is much brighter in person and the white is more like a light cream color the white is versatile for all seasons but i like the coral because its such an unusual color size regular xs is fitted on me not too tight not too loose but over the course of the day it stretches a little and the hem falls at the upper hip im b waist hips my favorite part is the arm holes are not too big the knit a,1
4454,Love this top got it in white for a recent trip to paris felt chic and cool during a bit of a spring heat wave in the city of lights it runs somewhat small im lbs broad shoulders and got the my usual fit but was a little snug i would recommend going up in size in this style the looked better because it is supposed to be a boxy swingy top,1
4455,I finally ordered a pair of these jeans after seeing so many rave reviews and when they went on sale im leaving this review for women who share my body typeim slim with longer legs and dont really have curves i typically dont purchase jeans with an inseam shorter than for reference i really love the fit of paige and mih jeansthese jeans have an inseam of which i thought would be fine but for me the cut wasnt flattering at all i typically look for jeans that,0
4456,After trying several sizes including petite and regular i am sad to return this dress the regular sizes were too long on me i am and although the petite fit me just a little short the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just couldnt get the fit usually i have great luck with cloth stone,0
4457,This dress is simply gorgeous the slit is just right the colors are great and most of all the fabric is very comfy i highly recommend,1
4458,This is a light so fun to wear shirt its delicate and can be worn to dress up jeans i would very much recommend it love it,1
4459,This top is exactly what i was expecting super comfortable while still looking stylish just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans,1
4460,I bought these about a month ago and i love them great fit not too tight for legging jeans which means i can dress up with a tunic and boots for work so stretchy and comfortable but still made out of a jeantype material love the color its a bit of a gray black so looks great with everything,1
4461,The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique,1
4462,I love this tunic purchased the dark orange in medium i am and lbs tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad so went with the medium and glad i did this top should be comfortable feels very fall and perfect for casual gettogethers and running around town only comment is that it is rayon and for me anyway rayon doesnt wash too well so we shall see how this one fairs,1
4463,This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed perhaps it could be used for a tank i am but do have a long torso it did not fully cover my booty,0
4464,This dress is very wellmade fullylined and overall quite beautiful however i will have to agree with the other reviewers who say that it runs small i am typically a solid medium in retailer clothes b lbs apple shaped long torso but the medium in this is skin tight not a good look the large fit much better and i did not find the skirt to be like a pencil the fit is like the picture and the length is at the knee anyway interesting that there is a such a huge differen,1
4465,Pretty and comfortable fun cardi for those of us who love a nice little cropped number glad to report that this cobalt beauty fits true to size in an xs all over shoulders hit at a nice place arms waist length is great above your waist or just at it the cotton is ultra comfortable the zipper has that luxurious feature of a double zip where you can zip from the bottom or the top once closed creating a nice opening i love this for a casual but chic holiday look thanks to the velvet ador,1
4466,This dress is absolutely stunning the colors are vibrant and it flows very nicely touching the floor it runs very small i ordered size medium and i could not even zip the dress i normally wear size i had to return it and order again in size large i love the fit this time but be aware if your normal size is higher than this dress will not fit and larger sizes are not available for this dress it is nice addition to my wardrobe and i am planning to wear it to the multiple occasion,1
4467,Bought this to wear to desert trip this weekend when we see the stones dylan mccartney who roger walters and neil young think its the perfect outfit as it definitely has an s feel now if only i had a pair of brown or teal boots it would be perfect ill keep hunting,1
4468,This is very large i normally am a sm and i took this in an x it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use,0
4469,This is a great fall boho dress you can dress up or down depending on the shoes looks great with boots but definitely size down,1
4470,Love this top so comfy and flattering i ordered the black and the blue and i am itching to get the redpurple one too,1
4471,I almost bought this tank online but decided to wait once i saw it in the store i knew i had to have it i bought it in the ivory color which is perfect the gold details are subtle and so pretty i dont find it too sheer as some of the other reviews have stated the cut is so flattering and it is easy to wear to work when paired with a cardigan,1
4472,Soft slouchy and comfortablewhat more could you ask for,1
4473,This runs large i usually wear a m so i ordered the ml reordering in next size down and hope that helps i gave it stars because the knit is beautiful and quality looked great,1
4474,I got this vest for my birthday and it is my favorite it has a very clean design well structured and you can really tell the product is high quality from the look and touch i would expect this to stay in my closet for years to come,1
4475,Love this shirt i bought the light blue color and its amazing fits well i love that its long in the back very comfortable and loose thinking of buying it in both pinks,1
4476,I am so happy i took a chance on this jumpsuit i am postbaby six weeks and although i intend on slimming down more i would say that it is flattering even at my current size and it will only get better the quality and color are great,1
4477,This a a great sweater it is classic but has the fun surprise element of the lace bell sleeves loved it so much i got the black and the sea mist looks great with jeans or leggings the only negative is you can call it that is that the sleeves are a tad long for me compliments everytime i wear,1
4478,I was a little hesitant to buy these given that i am just i didnt want to look like an extra from the set of newsies but these are very well made and tailored for a womans bodythe trousers actually accentuate the waist and the cropped leg works well for a petite frame they are nicely lined and the wool blend is soft and not scratchy i love them,1
4479,I really love these pants as loungers not sure i would wear them outside the house because the legs are very wide yes the elastic has the problem that others have mentioned but i just hold it in place when i pull them on and it stays put but the fabric is so soft that i put them on every night after work and sometimes dont take them off before bed pockets are a nice touch something i have come to love about retailer pants,1
4480,Adorable dress could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size i will order a and am hoping it will work out,1
4481,But tight around the chest i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else green color is classic and the back is longer than the front overall flattering if with the right outfit im dd and lbs for reference,1
4482,I purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet the style is very cute but the fabric is quite thin she will have to make that call but if i had bought it for myself it would be going back im not willing to wear a camisole under a tshirt it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when its washed so that remains to be seen,0
4483,Love the softness and the length the color was perfect but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections will be returning the sweater,0
4484,This is simply a fabulous dress i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small though there is nothing wrong with that i am not i am older and heavier and the dress fits very well im also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tentlike the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening it looks great with a jean jacket for example and booties and it also looks terrific with flats it d,1
4485,I ordered my usual size in tops at retailer in both the orangeblue print the pink color fit is tts looks pretty much on me as in the pic lightweight cool for these hot days the pink really is not pink its a true orange so i returned this one i didnt really need an orange top if it had been as in the pic which is a pinkcorallike color i wld have kept it the orangeblue print is really appealing so that is a keeper this top is a little flowy but not tentlike which is perfect,1
4486,I hesitated to spend the money on this sweater but somehow knew it would be my goto sweater for the season when i tried it on i knew i made the right decision it feels luxurious and fits like a dream the pop of color on the pocket is perfect to make a statement and to add something different from all those other sweaters the fit is tts,1
4487,This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch,1
4488,Love this top its a cotton and looks amazing with jeans you should consider ordering a size up i am usually an d and pound tried the in store it just didnt feel right the size fit just rightlove the shirt and got tons of complement,1
4489,Most flattering and perfect dark skinny jean obsessed is an understatement i am becoming a big fan of mother denim just enough stretch to be comfortable all day sit a little bit higher on my waist which is wonderful post babies and sometimes hard to find in jeans if you are in between sizes be sure to size down these jeans are stretchy to begin with and will stretch out a whole size i have never been happier with a pair of jeans,1
4490,Very cute top but runs very very big im ft in tall lbs i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top sadly returned the top otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric,0
4491,Love cloth and stone this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured soft and casual with great design details,1
4492,These pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned,1
4493,This is the perfect warm cozy boho sweater the blue trim really stands out and brightens up the grey this sweater will look cute over any outfit or with jeans i have long arms and the sleeves almost cover my hands which i really like i highly recommend this especially at off,1
4494,I love love love this skirt its comfortable and attention getting i receive compliments whenever i wear it and i feel great wearing it colors are much more vivid than on the website thats a plus,1
4495,This is a great looking sweater very nice quality and is a great design can wear with many colors love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look nice,1
4496,I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose i love it the bottom hem is slightly flared but does not look like a maternity tee im going to wear this with a fun scarf skinnies and colorful flats this tee is a must,1
4497,Very cute waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit,1
4498,Its hard to find a comfortable attractive tee this one is it for me ordered a large it skims perfectly over my back and lower half no grabbing sleeves are cut nicely for those of us who dont love their upper arms the lacing adds nice detail and interest its soft and comfy its an unusual color that will go with almost any bottom great now and under a jean jacket or cardigan as the weather cools,1
4499,This sweater is comfy and light and the buttons are a great added detail i bought this as a gift but i tried it on anyways and almost kept it for myself great for early spring days,1
4500,When i walked into my local retailer two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom unfortunately the small was sold out but they were able to order it online and have it sent gorgeous mediumtolightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in,1
4501,I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings i thought the price was great too good to be true you get what you pay for once i opened the box they smelled awful it was a chemical smell i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better i have washed the gray times and it still smells,0
4502,Love love love this dress quality and fabric are terrific design is a little s throwback fits well and flatters the body,1
4503,Coat is very soft and comfortable runs large usually wear an xsp could have gone with an xxsp if it came in that size the lining is very soft can wear a sweater or something heavier underneath if neededsome small little pulls on outside fabric but might be part of the fabric outside fabric is very soft would not have paid full price glad it was on sale as i had been eyeing it for some time it is cute and felt like twirling when put it on,1
4504,I wasnt sure about this dress and decided to give it a shot based on reviews could not be happier before trying it on i was worried about the length and always worry about dreaded button gap at the chest but none of that is an issue,1
4505,I bought this sweater in the black it is so flattering and feels great on the sleeves are a bit long but they are supposed to be the material is not overly thick yet it feels soft and well made while the lace sleeves are the star of this show the back is so flattering it has a perfect cut that i dont think comes through in the picture it fits true to size love this one,1
4506,I now have this tee in colors partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose but needed a small in this shirt goes great with all styles of jeansknakis,1
4507,This is such a cute dress the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight i ordered the blackbeige print and the fabric is beautiful it really drapes and hangs nicely because there is so much fabric i dont think this dress needs a lining it seems to wash and hang dry well im about lbs i like the way the medium fit the length was slightly above the knee which was ok with me im nearly all in all i can see mys,1
4508,Love these jeans they are the perfect relaxed fit not too baggy and a straight style i did size down because i wanted to wear them as shown i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips glad i did i usually wear size and took a in this pair the color and denim weight is also great,1
4509,On the hanger i thought this had a chance but oh geez puffy sleeves itchy metallic thread lace what a mess and thin and uncomfortable no no no,0
4510,I love this skirt i normally wear a medium or large depending on cut and i bought this in a medium very stretchy and forgiving its lined so it feels substantial but not too heavy its flattering,1
4511,This sweater is absolutely gorgeous the design and structure might make your shoulders look a little bigger but i absolutely love it it has a little boxy shape but i feel like it goes with te style love it get tons of compliments every time i wear it,1
4512,I love these pants comfortable light and can be dressed up for work and down for the weekend the color is a little more saturated in person but cant really complain about that too much,1
4513,I felt comfortable wearing this to a party easy to wear and accessorize,1
4514,I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit however when i got my pair the flower placement was completely different the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong but those were even worse they looked obscene,0
4515,I was at first a bit leery of this dress because of the shape baggy is in but its not always flattering i am usually a big smallmedium and the medium was too fluffy i realize its supposed to be loose but not that loose im and lbs and the small was the best option perfect amount of looseness but still gave a hint of shape it has pockets and is so comfortable im a school teacher so i try to find clothes that i can wear in both worlds this is definitely a keeper i will for,1
4516,I got this shirt weeks ago and have already worn it times i love it and every time i wear it i get compliments on it it is so flattering with jeans or nice fitted black pants if you are wavering about getting this shirt get it i promise you will love it,1
4517,I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size medium after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both great lightweight casual tee i love the button details on the shoulder,1
4518,Im normally a and ordered my normal size which fit perfect i purchased both the red and beige the quality fit and color are great im and the regular length was fine,1
4519,I purchased another top same brand in the same style from retailer and really love it the fabric is lightweight which makes it great for multiple seasons i travel extensively and these tops hand wash and hang to dry very nicely i wear a gray tank under this one and love the look i also like the long length as usual i will probably tack the neckline up an inch or so so that its not so low just my thing overall the pattern and the fabric are very nice i usually wear an xs or s i pur,1
4520,Tried this little gem on in the store but they were out of my size the ladies were so helpful ordered it shipped to me directly and i received it amazingly fast not an easy task when you live off grid in north idahoi wore it last night to a st patricks day party in california and received a ton of compliments paired it with black leggings and strap or black heels im still smiling today cant wait to wear it again the fit is flattering and the quality superbthanks retailer,1
4521,This one is a beauty my store is not carrying the white they had a lovely blue periwinkleish that immediately caught my eye the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop more so than the blue variety but both are stunning the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate quality most definitely in line with the price fit lbsc high waist im a or at retailer depending on the brand in most mou,1
4522,I usually wear a medium and bought a small it fit ok but had no shape and was not flattering i love baby doll dresses and tops but this was a tent my daughter saw me try it on and said thats a piece of tablecloth its going back,0
4523,I love this top it looks exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit i ordered the black and it is somewhat sheer the material has a slight burnout effect the black can be worn without a cami but if i wear it to work i will need to add one,1
4524,Tried this on on a whim and so glad i did it is lovely i cant wait for next summer now as ill definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan seems tts d and i bought in a small and it fits nicely a bit pricey for what it is or would have been more appropriate i think so try to get it on sale,1
4525,To be honest i bought this as a pregnancy top since i cant bring myself to buy actual maternity wear it is gorgeously made of lovely light material and i can actually see myself wearing it even after baby i find the asymmetrical hemline to be really chic overall a fave,1
4526,This is the perfect grab and go tshirt i love the fun design as it takes a simple tshirt and makes it fun i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look size down very cute,1
4527,I bought the blazer in the grey motif color it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as picturedi bought a small after trying it on in store i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer the arms are very fitted in my opinion so if you have bigger arms it might feel too snug you dont really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side meaning one folds back higher than the other so it isnt a symmetrical look i actually lik,1
4528,This sweater has every special element i could want form fitting feminine and attention to detail i ordered it in turquoise which is a lovely muted turquoise that works well when dressed up or down with a cream cami because i am petite the fitted waist detail in back hits me just in the right spot thank you retailer for another timeless addition to my collection of yours,1
4529,This is a beautiful lightweight sheer blouse the front has a liner and the arms and back are sheer i usually wear a s or xs the xs was plenty roomy ill wear a cami due to the sheerness of the back the cutouts in the long sleeves are quite pretty overall this is a classy blouse that can be worn with any number of jeans slacks or skirts thanks retailer,1
4530,I love this skirt and was so happy to see it in stores again in a great color for the fall the fit is great for me because i do not have a flat stomach and the elastic makes it comfortable to wear the material is a good quality this skirt adds the perfect pop of color to my closet,1
4531,This jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful i usually wear a size or small in everything at retailer sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it too tight on chest and arms i recommend going a size up also this jacket is really cropped probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it otherwise might appear too short,1
4532,I love these pants they are a beautiful color and very well made i like the fit and the style very much,1
4533,Was worried these pants would make my frame appear even shorter but no they looked great and fit perfectly very comfortable love your pilcro brand but will remember this brand for the future,1
4534,I bought this dress in both the red and black motifs and love them both im and usually a medium but i found the medium to run a little larger than expected its fine if you want the dress to hang looser on your body otherwise consider trying it a size down,1
4535,The small zipped and laid flat measures across at the bottom of the armholes at the waist and from shoulder seam to bottom edge its too small for a size and not by just a little too bad because it really is very pretty,0
4536,This dress is super cute and has the most striking color i got the blue i just love it its comfortable and flattering and hits me in all the right places i am a petite girl and normally wear a or in retailer dresses and as the other reviewers mentioned this runs small so a was what i needed and even the does not leave any wiggle room that said i like my dresses to fit sort of snugly so it works for me i highly recommend it overall the quality cut color and comfort all ma,1
4537,Such a beautiful dress with my favorite print it does run a size small if you ask me the size i got fits more like an the corduroy belt really sets the waist off,1
4538,This skirt fits my curves so well the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit it sits high on me but i have a very long torso so that didnt bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs the colors are vibrant and versatile,1
4539,I would have kept this dress if it werent for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides other than that it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice substantial material,0
4540,Wow this skirt blew me away out of the package i almost had to wonder if i received the right skirt i had ordered i thought the skirt was mostly an oatmeal isth color but irl the skirt is predominantly purple with real and beige colors weaved in the skirt itself is also a fine sweater knit which makes it look more luxurious im thinking this skirt will look awesome in the fall but might be a bit heavy for some in the summer weather the skirt is also longer than expected im and,1
4541,Love this dress so so much the wearability of it isnt much since its such a wow dress but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for itso perfect if it were a touch shorter id be happy wearing it to the park id suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when its so stunning long the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying look how cool this is,1
4542,This top is really cute my daughter tried it on and tried to take it,1
4543,I thought i would need a medium in this top but it was sold out so i crossed my fingers on a small it fits very well much like it fits on the model loose and length is good and i am not as slender as that model i am lbs the sweetheart neckline dips a little more than i would like in the frontbut i will figure that out the top is really unique and i love the shimmery dots,1
4544,This top is on the boxy side but the design is cute and i love the pink color the problem i had with this shirt is the huge arm holes one side you could see the top of my bra the other side was below the side of my bra you could also see the inside back of the shirt through this arm hole it was that big this went back will not reorder i usually order xs or xsp this was an xsp,0
4545,I love these pants beautiful quality material soft on the skin fits well definitely a tailored fit true to size unique design and really funi am foot and weigh lbs i am apple shaped so i was worried these would be too tight around the hips but they arent,1
4546,This dress is gorgeous and feels so soft looks great with booties and flats can be paired with so much jackets scarfs long necklaces so glad i bought it i did down size to a small from my usual medium and got the regular instead of petite fit great,1
4547,This dress is very flattering great unique dress,1
4548,Ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped spandex so returned,0
4549,Love these shorts not too tight and not too short they match so many tops tts for my hard to fit figure great for weekends vacations and just to be adorable in,1
4550,Love this dress adorable comfortable and figure flattering cant go wrong with this purchase,1
4551,This is cuter in person than online the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter the whole top is soft like a tshirt material there is an elastic band at the bottom but its not too cinched so it wont cut into your waist it just gives it a little bit of shape its a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric im looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside a good price for retailer,1
4552,I was really excited to get this dress i initially ordered a small i am a size but when i tried it on it was really tight the bodice at the top fit strangelyi had to shorten the straps quite a bit and the dress just looked off i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there and the look of the dress on line was beautiful but just didnt fit right i did love the lace look and would love seeing more dresses with this design,0
4553,Theres something special about this tank that makes it uberflattering the fabric is perfect the colors green and fuchsia are spoton gorgeous and brightening and the cut length wide straps and scooped neckline make this the perfect staple it flattered my figure skin color and really hid my flaws i wish i could get away with wearing this every day,1
4554,I recently bought this dress and wore it once i really liked it it was comfy cute and fit well but then i washed it i followed the washing instructions exactly but now it looks more like a shirt than a dress and its completely unwearable im super disappointed because i thought this dress would be a wardrobe staple this summer,0
4555,This is a basic that ive been looking for for ages ive never found such a flattering plain white button down shirt before everything is either not basic enough unflattering shape too masculine too boring too wrinkly or too hard to take care of this shirt is perfect it is shaped to flatter but doesnt have any finicky details this is just a wardrobe staple plain and simple it is going to work hard for me year round i have other cloth stone tops and have loved them all their,1
4556,Beautiful and chic so glad i tried it on,1
4557,So soft comfortable and warm i ordered the black and think ill buy the grey and lavender as well the material is a little syntheticalmost shiny looking but definitely not a deal breaker these are my new lounge pants recommend,1
4558,This product is comfortable and stylish i love the design and the color print i can dresss it up and dress it down it goes with everything and also fits great,1
4559,It turned out exactly as id hoped very well made and very classy,1
4560,These pants were wonderfulfor seasons yes for almost a pop they dont even last a full year loved them so much i bit the bullet bought pair all started to rip in the same spot i tried to contact ag directly they do not back up their products after days fortunately retailer was wonderful as always i will buy pilcro from now on much better product for the money,0
4561,Im and petite and had originally ordered s but decide that it was a bit large for me so i returned it and ordered the xs and it fit like a glove with breathing space i love the conservative style i can easily move around in it when im in the water with my baby i dont have a large chest but i imagine this would great for big busted girls its lightly padded around the bust area the skirt detail is very cute and the print is unique ive already gotten compliments on it,1
4562,Ive been trying on boyfriend jeans for more than a year finally found a pair that fit and were comfortable many of them had no stretch at all and were very uncomfortable these have just enough stretch but not too much i usually wear a tried on the which were comfortable but too loose at the waist the were a perfect fitim lbs,1
4563,This is a great shirt to wear with jeans or pants i love the tucks in front with brass buttons you dont have to unbutton all of them as the shirt slides easily over your head i love the pattern and it is a great look for fall and later on winter i think this will be my goto shirt this season,1
4564,Love love love this sweater it is so comfy and well made this is a piece i will have for a very long time the beautiful lace detail are the sleeves are to die for picture doesnt do this sweater justice,1
4565,I fell in love with this top as soon as i tried it on its the perfect springtosummer top the fabric is light and airy and the brown stripes give it a lackadaisical vibe the little buttons on the back are a cute detail that really give something extra to an otherwise simple top and the vneck did not reveal any cleavage i bought this in a large and id say it runs a little on the larger side but i like that because it adds to the comfortable flowy nature of the design for reference,1
4566,Ordered this in white and the peachy color the armholes were gaping not well designed i dont recommend this tee at all,0
4567,I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it i got home and showed my husband my purchases i told him i wasnt sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it so great for a spring wedding fits true to size i am ccup and i bought my normal size this made my waist look really small,1
4568,I wanted this dress so much i ordered it twice both times the zipper was defectiveit would get stuck midway up at the waistlineso i had to send it back there isnt an retailer in my area this is a shame because its got great colors and looks flattering on and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardiganboots for fall i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced but the cost didnt seem worth it too bad as it seems like it would be a nice,0
4569,I love this dress it is beyond flattering i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste this however is the same cut on top but longer in the skirt yes please i purchased the turquoise which is exactly as pictured just beautiful hits at my shins for reference im lbs and ordered a size small,1
4570,The softest tank i own even though its a soft burnout fabric its still not too sheer great quality,1
4571,This sweater is more stunning in person then on the site i saw it on the internet previous to seeing in the store i purchased it right away it was love at first sight the detail on the collar is beautiful and reminds me of the unique sweaters i have have in my closet from retailer from years ago that i still love get it before its gone,1
4572,I absolutely love this sweater its super soft and the greywhite version is lovely its definitely more cropped im but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt so cozy,1
4573,Cute and comfortable has layered design with black underneath which adds dimension and warmth can wear in multiple seasons with and without jacket,1
4574,These tights are exactly what i was looking for they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn outdressed up or for lounging around at the house they are a nice weight and durable construction i plan to pair them with skirts tunics and dresses they are super cute with ankle boots,1
4575,I actually ended up buying two of these dresses i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out the good news is that it was on sale this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get for reference i purchased the small its loose but the shoulders armholes and slip all fit perfectly i weigh,1
4576,I wanted to like this sporty dress too i teach at an elementary school and like to get down on my knees st my students level plus we can get messy most days with our learning and most days are go go go being on every secondthe armholes were cut too big and weirdly squared i didnt like the middle ridge either as it was unflattering it was returned,0
4577,Im always on the search for a comfortable shirt with style this does not disappoint super comfy and flattering love,1
4578,I love these jeans i am normally a so i went with a petite im and the length was perfect the was a little big so im going to order the petite and compare they r a great material and very stretchy,1
4579,I bought this dress to wear to a funeral i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets the fabric lies beautifully on the body i would recommend this dress,1
4580,I got size and they dont fit me as ankle they fit me as long skinnies but the quality is so good theyre smooth and stretchy but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell its quality denim a great pant buy if youre looking for soft as butter grey jeans,1
4581,I bought the dress in black it is very elegant with a fun flare suits my taste it does run a size too small like other reviewer mentioned the material has no give at all i couldnt breathe in my regular size one size up fits like a glove it is a perfect party dress to show your free and fun spirit,1
4582,This is my favorite purchase so far i am in love with this jumpsuit it it fitted on top and has a flowy dress feel on the bottom i got this on sale recently and if you can grab it do it you wont be disappointed,1
4583,Must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes beautiful im machine washing w delicates n hang dry comes out great easy breezy,1
4584,I needed a dress to go to a reunion partynot hs and this fit the bill perfectly it fits perfectly and its short but not too short it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its perfect for out to dinner,1
4585,I really like this top it is made of cotton and linen blend so the fabric is not as soft as i would have expected however it did not bother me at all and i am really liking itthe fabric is on a sheer side so it is a bit see through nothing too revealing however it is a thin fabricoverall i am happy with this top,1
4586,I usually wear a in ag and other designer jeans i ordered a based on the other reviewers they fit like the model and look great i might have been able to go with if these end up stretching out so im hoping they dont they are nice and thick for white jeans yet soft and comfy,1
4587,This top definitely drew my attention when i walked into the store i loved the back and the fabric is super softsilky i tried it one and the usual fit nicely i dont have petite to compare or but i decided to stick with it will look so nice with white shorts or navy or jeans or even my denim pencil skirt why i decided to buy it i really must avoid the store lbs for reference,1
4588,I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it i am lbs and d i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone definitely one of the best things ive ever bought from retailer,1
4589,I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent this top is so soft and a bit billowy the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall i love the little details staggered paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isnt as apparent in the photos considering another color as well,1
4590,I adore this dress the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look the bottom hem is this super cute fringe so fun and feminine and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric this dress,1
4591,Love adds texture and femininity to a basic sweater ordered a small so i could layer if youre busty or between a s and m you may want to size up,1
4592,This skirt is perfection i am ibs and the fit perfect the picture does not even do it justice it is much more softer than i thought it would be in the picture it seems stiff looking but that is not the case at all cant wait to wear this skirt for the summer you can dress it up with a nice blouse and heels or keep it casual with a relaxed tee and sandals i will defiantly get a lot of use out of this piece,1
4593,Another reviewer mentioned this was maternityish i am currently almost months pregnant and i have to say this is a wonderful maternity dress even if thats not what it was made for when not pregnant i think this might have been a little overwhelming and i guess well see next year if thats the case for me there is a lot of fabric here i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows the colors on the blu,1
4594,I loved the design and material of the test but unfortunately it just did not fit me right it was tight in the hips and did not have the relaxed look i was hoping for also the pattern did not look good on me unfortunately i had to return,0
4595,Totally my style i love how it hangs and is so soft and comfy material is thin enough to be fairly lightweight and i was worried about it being clingy so happy its not body skimming and very flattering for full bust vneck helps here if like me you dont like tight chested clothing also love the length of this top im and ddd size l fits me just how i like it,1
4596,I purchased this dress for a special occasion and am delighted its exactly what i was hoping for everything from the way it fits to the way it feels is perfect i highly recommend it,1
4597,So much prettier in person beautiful colors matched together so light and relaxing love at first sight,1
4598,I love charlie pants ive bought a few in the past and ive never been disappointed with quality style or fit i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result i wish more pants were side zip so much more flattering i got these in a my usual size and the fit is perfect i also got these in the regular rather than petite but the length works just fine for my height i bought these in the grey stripe but like them so much i think ill order another pair in the orange,1
4599,I love the dress fits as pictured im a size and fits just right it is a keeper well made,1
4600,Great pop of color i purchased the rosy color and great piece you can add layers to it drapes beautifully may run a tad larger but not enough to size down light weight so wear alone for warmer fall days or as we get into spring and with a scarf and jacket for cooler days,1
4601,I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look,1
4602,Love the lilac purple color breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin i like the small detail cut out in the back and a high bonus point for not showing your bra one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back but not a big deal,1
4603,Love these they are my new favorite weekend pant they are comfortable versatile and cute the fit and cut are great too a must have for your wardrobe,1
4604,While the blue color pictured is stunning i purchased the white poplin in store two best features the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small v a great detail especially for short or sweptup hair during summer months next this white fabrics crisp finish is coupled with a just right weight solid enough to be opaque but light enough for warm days plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer thrilled,1
4605,I tried this topper sweater on at the store but wanted to wait for it to go on sale so i just purchased it with my extra thirty percent off and think its such a nice deal i really like how this one is soft well made has nice long sleeves and how adorable the inside lining is the lining matches the print inside the pockets that peak out a bit i didnt find this one too boxy for me as its a topper after all there are no closure buttons or clasps but i think its a great piece to throw on w,1
4606,This dress looks great onfeminine and swishy color is bright and the underslip is nicely attached which i appreciateno fighting with straps etc i ordered a six for my lb dd self and it fits like a dream the extra lbs i support with lots of food is on my tummy just to give you an idea of my shape,1
4607,Love this shirt so much i bought it in different colors the reviews said it was so boxy and plain but i disagree looks great with jeans or a skirt without looking looking too casual love that they are not too long also so many tees are soon long and these are not thank goodnessdefinitely runs big,1
4608,I got this dress in pxxs in the gray color i am lbs petite frame and it fits like a dream true to size the fabric is super soft and thick drapes well not too tight and u can wear a regular bra length is also perfect no shortening required which is rare for me this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion can be casual or dressy depending on accessories great purchase recommend,1
4609,I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors otherwise the shirt will snag and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes lots of bra showing not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan but it would be nice not to have to other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything,1
4610,Looks great the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area total disappointment i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side,0
4611,This is a very cute top i am lbs dd and a large fit great it fit perfectly in the chest but the top is meant to be baggy at the bottom and long it covers my bum looks very cute with skinny jeans love it,1
4612,I cant believe how much i paid for this topgot free shipping special so worth it i ordered the blue and i love it size small fits perfectly i am into peplum tops lately they are so flattering with highwaisted jeans i usually wear a size in retailer,1
4613,I agree with the other reviewers this top is completely disappointing in every way i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag where to beginit runs really bigits short and boxy not at all like it appears on the model this must be pinned a lot in this picturecolors are completely dull in person i really think this picture was lightened a great dealfabric feels cheap and stifflining is stuff and poorly sewni havent one positive thing to say about t,0
4614,I agree with the other reviewer the snaps at the ankle are a cute idea but bad in execution they look and feel odd when onthese fit tts and they are soft with decent stretch but the rise is much lower on me than other rise jeans i have as a yearold woman they seemed inappropriately lowhanging on meas an aside these will def color transfer there is a whole lotta rinse on these and they have a strange chemical smell to them not sure if that will diss,0
4615,I love this blouse the shape is very flattering the fabric is sheer perfect for those hot summer days i especially like the way the sleeves fall just enough flounce the buttons are a great detail i didnt bother undoing them just threw it over my head looks great dressed up or down,1
4616,I am and lbs w a muscular bubble butt from climbing and biking usually have trouble w shorts fitting right because my legs and waist dont match my butt these shorts run large i got a medium which should have been okay but they stretched out quite a bit after one wear so am returning for a small its crazy for my butt to be in a smallanything so if you are a skinny minny or have a flat butt these may not work for you in that you dont have anything to hold these up besides the,1
4617,As the other reviewer said the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hipsit was ridiculous i dont know how anyone could wear itlooks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip im long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well very very strangely constructedi couldnt keep it even at the deeply discounted price,0
4618,Very versatile top i feel like i could dress it up or down fits very nice and the material is soft,1
4619,I really wanted to love this top but there is way too much fabric it looks nothing like the pictures it was more like a maternity top vs a swingy top ill be returning this one,0
4620,I ordered my usual sz s during the promo arrived yesterday the fit is perfect w a little room to spare for layering its a snap front closure front patch pockets attached hood that is small to med sizenot huge or overwhelming its acrylic which isnt my st choice but soft comfy seems good quality length falls abt below my knees arm length is fine pretty much looks as in the pic including the marled color if you are in need of a great functional long swtr w good looks,1
4621,This is a great sweater soft and beautiful its my new go to sweater,1
4622,I truly feel guilty wearing these outdoors it is incredibly comfortable so much so that i asked the sales girl if these were pjs or actually worn out im usually between a s and m both fit fine but i went with the m to have a bit more room and allow the top to be a bit more flannel flowy the top has enough length that i can actually let it droop over the waist bet a bit the length is definitely upper thigh on me but rest assured nothing is hanging out its actually the p,1
4623,I bought this dress online last week in large part based on all the positive reviews then i saw it in the store i didnt try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didnt carry petites i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed for some reason i didnt realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it well it came today and i figured,1
4624,I had fallen in love with the coral dress that was somewhat like this one and came out a few months ago but the problem im having with this one is the same problem i had with the coral one they are all flawed in their construction i had eventually tried size s in the coral because each one was flawed on one one side hung longer than the other and on all the top design did not line up with the bottom design this blue one is the same way the top design does not line up with the bot,0
4625,I needed a tee refresher i had a good feeling about this one so ordered all three colors when they were on a promo and im not disappointed the neckline is different and works great to emphasize your favorite necklace the tee holds shape after washing and drying my favorite is the blue which i like to wear with dark wash jeans as styled on the model the white has a cream tinge to it and im able to wear it with a nude bra without looking indecent there is a cute little button detail at th,1
4626,This is a really unique and well made top i saw it online and thought it would be boxy but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape i bought the size small i will say this is not a long shirt skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering i will be getting a lot of wear out of this,1
4627,This is much more a blouse than a tee the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff starched cotton not stretchy jersey because of that i felt like this top ran small i had to size up,1
4628,I was so sure i was going to love this dress when i saw it on the rack i was so disappointed by how poofy on the bottom it was not flattering at all id love to see this pattern back with a better fit,0
4629,Love the pilcro brand size down super soft well fitting great length great darker color for fall awesome rise not too high not too low will be grabbing these a ton this fall,1
4630,Great knee length lovely twirl and drape though a staple piece the material and the blend of the navy and black bring this skirt up a notch pull on styling i purchased a small and returned it for an extra small as it was too large in the waist i like my skirts to sit at the natural waist and with the style of this skirt i think that would look most flattering and slimming my waist is abt for reference c bust and hips abt and typically a at retailer the skirt is quite s,1
4631,I ordered this blouse online bc i couldnt find it in my local stores once it was on sale the fabric is so delicate the cutouts had already frayed and in some places torn had to return it,0
4632,I purchased this sweater after i saw it on a salesclerk at my local retailer store i am usually a xs but based on reviews decided to size up considering the description of the fit of arms when it arrived it was overall ok but seemed boxy at sides so i exchanged for my usual size it arrived today and fits greatless fabric along sides but still good length for my slender frame the arms and shoulders are not too snug the colors are beautiful and it is out of the ordinarya statement piece,1
4633,I have to agree with the first reviewer i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldnt justify it for the price i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well but just couldnt get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews,0
4634,Ill admit its been a few months since ive shopped at retailer i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesnt seem to be much consistency between the brands im so glad i wandered in our local store this week this top is so beautiful in person and wellmade the embroidery is lovely and its lined so not too sheer im tall and it was a good length hitting just above the hip i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big the s fit perfectly across the chest,1
4635,Sweet leg warmers that are fun and cute too kept me warm when out in this frosty morning,1
4636,I just purchased these pants in red on sale i am pounds and the fit perfectly i am either an or a in pants depending upon brand it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute unique workappropriate and flattering these pants fit the bill in all aspects i thought i would prefer the black but am really glad i got the red,1
4637,I ordered the orange color too these are perfect for throwing on over workout clothes and then running errands,1
4638,I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye overall the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good i also agree that the slits are to high they should have made them stop at a lower point it gives an odd effect the tunic looks good especially with tights it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics,1
4639,This is a really cute and flattering dress on me i am lbs and the is a perfect fit i am a little busty but the empire seam brings the dress back in slightly below my chest so it does not tent outthe asymmetrical hem makes it really flowy when you walk the under dress is a lightweight fabric in a sheath cut that is shorter than the over dress which is a fun detail the over dress material is somewhat gauzy and it moves as you move the pockets are positioned in the front which is a,1
4640,Its very beautifully designed simple but elegant material is thick and soft so it makes good shape color is a little different from picture but it didnt disappoint me because everything else is so good,1
4641,I loved this top when i tried it on in the store i was very close to buying but i knew my sister would want so i moved on it is a great fitting top i am lbs and the small fit perfectly i do question how well this top will fit petite people,1
4642,Super itchy had to return,0
4643,Pictures do not do this top justice looks much cuter in person it caught my eye right away in the storeperfect top for when the weather starts getting a little cooler,1
4644,I have these tops in white and blue very comfotable to wear the back part swings with movements and is flattering good price so i got one for my daughter,1
4645,I absolutely adore this top it is super soft i purchased it in the wine color i would recommend this for anyone if they have other colors i plan on buying them i am going to wear this with jeans and my furry vest in the fallwinter,1
4646,Bought this in navy needed something comfortable but able to dress up denim this was perfect wore it already and immediately got complements the only drawback was that the elastic in cuffs was a little too tight and my forearms are not large bought in medium im and lbs just washed it for first time noticed that it dried a little wrinkly in front may have to steam to get wrinkles out but still worth it,1
4647,I really wanted to love this shirt the snowflake and stripe design is really cute and the fabric is of nice quality its a very loose fit which i wouldve been willing to work with but as mentioned in previous reviews the shoulder seam rests in an odd place on your upper arm and there are little bumps in the fabric on the arms that appear similar to what happens if you leave a shirt on a wire hanger too long it looks like you have nubby little wings coming out of your arms not attrac,0
4648,The print length and cut are all flattering i bought the other tiny dress that was similar and will buy every pattern they make,1
4649,Super soft and comfortable with a flattering fit love the tiny buttons and the sleeves since many times the sleeves are too long for me already my favorite fall top,1
4650,I have been looking for a good red cardigan for some time now this one perfectly meets my needs and now i want it in more colors the sweater has a nice cut and it is very soft and comfortable i know this will be a go to staple piece in my closet,1
4651,I loved this romper so much the material is thin but perfect for summer the style is just what i was looking for its so so cute and fit perfectlyat first i wore it one time and then washed it exactly as described on the tag and it shrunk beyond recognition it went from loose and flowy like on the model to little booty shorts and a body suitnot the look i was going for i am so disappointed,0
4652,Grabbed this off the sales racknot expecting muchbut it is a great sweater like other reviewers mentionedroomy but still form fitting i wear it to work with black pants and boots and it looks great cozy warm very cute i usually wear a small but got an xs in this a much better sweater than how it appears in the online pics,1
4653,I love wearing this blouse with jeans and my cute sneakers this blouse is frilly and flirty it has three quarter sleeves that have one cute fabric covered buttons that match the button front closure i am ft inch pear shaped and my bust line is c i ordered an xs and small regular i ended up with the small regular and it fits nicely and i get loads of compliments when i wear it its made very well and the plaid pattern is random i wear a cute boxy sweater over it when its chilly a,1
4654,Love my new wardrobe addition fits perfect and goes with everything,1
4655,Such cute soft and comfortable shorts can be worn as night wear or out and about,1
4656,Absolutely love this top it can be worn with jeans or a nice pair of pants material is so soft love the length little longer in the back definitely would buy in another color,1
4657,Cute shirt it looked big so i ordered a size smaller worked fine would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back fun shirt though,1
4658,This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house its so soft and the waffle texture looks nice id definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood the fabric is thin but isnt too delicate and its not sheer which makes it a great summer lounge shirt the cut is flattering and the back doesnt show my bra which too many of this design do it is a bit large you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious,1
4659,Agree with other poster this shirt runs very big im all for a flowy shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent ill be retuning it,0
4660,I ordered this skirt in both colors and they are just to die for the fun fabrics make it a playful and trendy take on a timeless essential and the fit is incredibly flattering an added bonus the fabric has give so its also extremely comfortable i hope they come out with more color options,1
4661,I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great i originally got a and a and kept the because of the stretch it fit perfectly nice length and great quality,1
4662,I like how styling and comfortable it is i bought it in both colors definitely a nice piece for fallwinter in this houston weather,1
4663,Maeve has done it again with a fabulous blouse i bought in the blue motif and the colors are so wonderfully fall the length is great for skinny jeans and leggings loved that it covered the rear end as well i am lbs curvyathletic frame c and the size small fit well,1
4664,Im glad i discovered this super easy to wear flattering summer dress on a recent store visit if i had only seen it online im not sure i would have ordered it i prefer it styled with flat sandals for an effortless boho look im slim and small chested and xs fit perfectly,1
4665,Love love love it is a little boxy but it is soo soft and comfortable it does run at least a size or big i picked it up in the pink color yesterday at me local retailer store was not sure about it when i first saw it online but fell in love with it quickly when i tried it on great sweater for fallwinter,1
4666,While the print is cute the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model it rides up under your boobs and the whole cup area tips forward its not really molded like a bra more flat foam insert immediately went back hopefully if retailer continues to do swimwear theyll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure theyre also workable for fuller cup sizes underwire please,0
4667,Love this sweater its perfect for chilly florida eveningslove the loose boxy shape and its very cozy not itchy,1
4668,You know how sometimes you put something on and dont even have to look in the mirror to know you like it well this is that piece of clothing i bought a jumpsuit last year at retailer and wore it all the time so i wanted to get a new one this year i saw this on the website and liked it all the way through when i put it on at the store comfy casual not too young for my yearold self the right length and i can comfortably wear a regular bra with it perfect on all counts,1
4669,I rarely even try on denim at retailer because im quite curvy and the styles while cute on the models rarely have fit me not so with these jeans theyre my first pair of pilcros and a steal at the sale price im lbs d for reference and i purchased a regular even though im often a in my favorite long and lean jeans they hug my butt and hips in a very sexy way but not to the point of not being able to wear them at my office i will need to get them hemmed but not,1
4670,This is such a beautiful dress fell in love with it at first sight it is very pretty can be dressed up or down comes with an attached slip that is a tad longer than the dress and it shows on the bottom darling dress that will get lots of use this summer,1
4671,This top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone i would recommend this and cant wait to wear it,1
4672,This skirt has a great pattern and the stretchy fabric allows it to shape my body perfectly adorable with a whitet or a black onegreat for a night out on the town and some sexy strappy sandals love this skirt,1
4673,I love this tee very soft and easy care gentle cycle hand to dry,1
4674,I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more denim version the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser less flattering fit returned it and kept the regular ag stevie,0
4675,Loved the color and the deshn but when i put on did not look right waist was too short and the arms were long,0
4676,I usually wear a size the fit was perfect highly recommend many compliments,1
4677,I always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed i love the way it wraps fits perfectly i got a size medium and i am dd the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels i recommend this,1
4678,This dress is absolutely beautiful it fits like a glove and the material is super soft so in love with this im m and normally a xss the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest the arm holes were a bit tighter on me the sp was way too large,1
4679,I love this dress but it definitely runs big i bought a size small and im between a and a and will have to return for an xs the top feels like it will fall down and im a size c,1
4680,I adore this dress but i never would have bought it if i didnt wear it with a belt as some reviewers have said its a sack the belt takes care of this it still isnt a slimming dress but i really dont mindthe elegance and comfort make up for itim c and curvy in the hips and the medium fit perfectly i could see this fitting strangely if you were larger in the bust,1
4681,This dress looks and feels cheap the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking overall a pretty horrible dress save your money,0
4682,I bought this top for my daughter the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach my daughter loves it,1
4683,This sweater just grows on me every time i put it on it is so comfortable flattering and literally the perfect winter sweater the length is long but so comfortable with leggings or skinny jeans absolutely love it i have the cream color one and i have to wear a tank under but the material and look is perfect,1
4684,Im an xl but ended up buying this in a size large i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front i also really like that this is cotton and even though it is heavy and substantial the thread gauge is a fine weight while this says i can hand wash the sweater im reluctant to because im worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape i dont care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck but my hair hides that overall,1
4685,This blouse looks even better in person it fits true to size and is lightweight i am not a huge fan of designs on shirts and usually stick with solids but i find this design to be very flattering i just bought it today but i know i will get a lot of use out of it,1
4686,Swingy and just the right weight for the office the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra even for the office because you cant really see through it im wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts black pants and skinny jeans,1
4687,Such a great classic top very flattering can be worn all year i bought it in grey but think ill need it in other colors,1
4688,From the online pics i would never think to try this on but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets so glad i did i purchased in green and navy i love the neck line when buttoned up almost military jacketish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket super soft material i purchased a size and i am and lbs,1
4689,I love this jacket and always get compliments when i wear it i have the green version and the color is lovely the sleeves are the perfect length i got a petite size and it is very flattering the jacket is not warm enough for a really windy snowy day but is perfect for cool fall days,1
4690,I missed out on the sherpa vest in caramel last year and didnt want to miss out again cant wait to wear this when it gets chilly i am between a s m but the small was very comfortable it could be easilly layered over a thicker item or a tshirt as pictured so glad i picked this one up,1
4691,These are the best fitting jeans ive ever owned no puckering near the crotch and i dont need to have the waistband taken in they probably run small,1
4692,If you have any curves avoid it is not flatteringthe striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress,0
4693,Women who want some flutter without too much fullness,1
4694,Love this sweaterjacket fit is good and the colors are just right not to bright and not boring the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen very cool have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments,1
4695,This sweater was pretty short beyond that when i raised my arms the thickness of the sweater caused the shoulders to rise up and stay there when i put my arms down,0
4696,I tried this in the store and i like it nice and soft good basic design that will pair with many pieces but i decided to wait because of the price im sure i would get a lot of use out of this top but ultimately it didnt thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase i bought a sweater that was on sale instead still a very nice top i may buy it eventually especially if it goes on sale,1
4697,I love these pants a dry cleaner lost my favorite black pair ten years ago i have not used them sinceif you wait long enough everything comes back in style i bought black and rust these pants are comfortable the perfect length can dress up or down and are very very cute,1
4698,The length of this dress is bizarre i cant decide if its supposed to lay on the floor or not touch it at all im not sure if i like it either way also at this price point i would have hoped to have the included under layer to not be so transparent if you buy this dress be prepared to invest in a slip and then have the slip tailored to match the high low hem line so that people cannot see your underwear the netting and details in this dress are beautiful but delicate the one i pur,0
4699,I bought this skirt in the blue motif in my usual size large it is very comfortable light and it is lined i wore it with a navy cotton lace meadow rue top from last year gold gladiator sandals and a long gold retailer necklace,1
4700,This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky lookingsometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow this sweaters knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments,1
4701,This is a fantastic dress its very flowy comfortable stylish and it has pockets whoop whoop i have a larger bust d and even though its button down the openings in between dont peak open to show your bra it is navy and red but i think you could wear black boots with it no problem this is my new favorite dress and im very happy with my purchase buy it,1
4702,I loved this dress when i saw it in the store the colors weight fabric love love love unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large i tried on a size petite which is my usual size all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way but in the end i had to pass,0
4703,Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many bandage dresses the navy color softens the stripes great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle i am and lbs with a smaller chest and curvy hips the small fits perfectly,1
4704,I went to my local retailer store in kansas citymo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because its so soft and very flattering on my body type i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money,1
4705,I purchased this striped racer tank to wear during the day on july th it was perfect the back is really special and dresses it up,1
4706,So i notice most ladies on retailer love to say how tiny they are so some of us that are busty and have a hipthis is nice i actually couldve done a medium but the large was the only one and on sale its meant to be loose its kind to ladies that arent all size,1
4707,This dress is a staple if you dont feel like getting too dressed up and want to be comfortable this is it will be great for travel as well i like to pack light so i look forward to traveling with this dress,1
4708,I love love love this top it is beautiful and very unique the first day i wore it i got so many compliments highly recommend,1
4709,Wow im in love when i first saw this i put it in my cart when i went back to purchase it it was sold out in my size i was so bummed i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it thank heavens when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too grandmay of a design but i was wrong its just gorgeous can totally be dressed up or down so flattering love love love it,1
4710,I love this top other reviewers have mentioned the softness of the material and the cozy perfect for fallperfect for the sf bay area winter but i would like to call out my favorite element of the top being the scoop in the back it adds just a little bit of soft sexiness while being just right for a comfortable weekend sweater to a dressed up office appropriate shirt,1
4711,Now i ordered both striped versions and i dont know which to keep the material is a nice soft knit the neck line is almost boatneck with little buttons so cute colors are really nice too i tried it on with skinnies and trousersa nd ti looked great with both i went with the petite version for those shorter gals out there xxs petite fit me i havnet tried o the xs petite yet and lbs i think it would loke nice with a pencil skirt too if i only had one that went wit,1
4712,Ive received so many complements when i wear this tunic its so comfortable and fits great the fabric is light and feels good against my skin this is by far my most favorite purchase from retailer and i wear it all the time with my leggings love love love this tunicdress,1
4713,I would suggest trying this on in store the xs wouldve worked thats my normal size but i ended up preferring the s it does have low armholes the s in the yellow was just right for me but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked still a very cute and classic top that i know ill get a lot of use out of,1
4714,Excited to get this sweater im a c and usually wear a size blouse so i ordered an xl as i dont like clingy sweaters this was perfect fitted but not tight ill be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date wish i couldve gotten it for the off free sh but glad i didnt wait this size was sold out first,1
4715,This is the first hd in paris top i havent loved high hopes for this top since i love the brand and the color this was an online only item so i guessed at the size typically order a petite ordered the regular since the length was already quite short in the regular length it was oddly constructed small in the arms but boxy and oddly bell shaped bottom the lining was tough to keep straightened while trying to put iton too bad but it went back,0
4716,I love love love this top ive bought several over the years and they wash great and are very flattering and comfortable i always pick up the newest color,1
4717,I love the look and feel of this tulle dress i was looking for something different but not over the top for new years eve im small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look once i steamed the tulle it was perfect i ordered an xsp length was perfect too,1
4718,I bought this top in my usual size large and it is slightly big but not so much that i would want to size down the material is slightly itchy but i think that its worth it because its such a pretty top i absolutely love the detail at the top it is beautiful if you wear a nude bra you cant see the strap lines through the material i also love the coloring of this top this is a great top that i can see myself wearing with dress pants for work or with jeans for a more casual look,1
4719,Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe love the grey color and the material is super soft glad i snagged this up for less than,1
4720,This is such a fun dress to wear i wanted something comfortable and flirty and this checked off both boxes im typically a small size but went w xsmall on this one to hug the shoulders more,1
4721,I purchased these shorts in a size im on the petite side of things and the shorts are a little big the tiefront allows you to tighten the short i actually think the photo does a good job showing this item the color is a washed out gray and the shorts are not too short the fabric is light and this will be great for hotter days i like them,1
4722,Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality,0
4723,This dress is perfect im literally wearing it right now its crazy comfortable while still being flattering it looks and feels high quality and just barely doesnt hit the floor it makes me feel like a goddess plenty of room in the bust area even for me dd and doesnt show bra straps or underwear highly recommended,1
4724,The material is cheap and looks torn not as nice as the picture,0
4725,for the model to look like thispros nice quality the colors of the blue version at least are rich and beautiful note that the dark color pictured is really brown not black the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fallwinter it is layered over a bright navy poly slipcons i am i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med the sleeves were more dolman than fitted i imagin,0
4726,These shorts are perfect not too short but can be cuffed so not too long either the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my hyphen shorts collection you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops note if you like your shorts loose order true to size they do stretch at the waist so if you want them to fit true to size order onetwo sizes down,1
4727,I was a little skeptical about this one at first i have a hard time with the over all styling of many maxi dresses i liked the print and figured i would give this a whirl it is beautiful looks great on and i love the fabric so happy i picked this one up,1
4728,Versatile and fun dress color is better in person than picture looks great with jeans jacket for chilly moments doesnt wrinkle on long airplane trip and rolls up teenytiny for packing,1
4729,This is a great blouse for all shapes you can wear it under a suit or with jeans,1
4730,I run lbs d and ordered a regular probably could get away with a i didnt order a petite because i wanted the length however i ordered the because it is cotton hand wash and thinking there might be some shrinkage it fits to perfection everywhere but the waist its very loose they must have clipped it in at the waist in the back of this shot on the model the picture doesnt clearly show the hilow concept of the hem i like that so it isnt a problem very unique a,1
4731,No size fit me im normally a s to m the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow perhaps in length so i ended up without it sadly its really a very nice top and great quality i was unhappy to leave it behind,1
4732,In love with this as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color super soft and easy to wear i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer felt pricey but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it i am and the large is a great fit perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank which is what i wanted,1
4733,This jumpsuit looked so great on the model and looked so hideous on me im and in great shape and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculousnot to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way im so disappointed,0
4734,Tried this top on in store in a small and it was a bit snug in the chest dd but loved it otherwise the sales associate had it shipped to me in a medium and it is perfect a great length over leggings or skinny jeans and is lightweight enough for warmer days or can be layered with a tank underneath and a cropped cardigan for colder ones,1
4735,Ordered this top online color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous comfortable and flattering so much so i am ordering the navy too great quality fabulous with jeans,1
4736,These shorts are super comfy and the color is awesome,1
4737,I ordered both colors in xxs xs p and xxs p were both sold out at the time sale came on verdict fits really nicely but short i would have to wear this with higher rise pants or pencil skirt like the red one is pictures with a polka dot skirt i decided to keep the red one because it is a bot more unique i do have a few navy tops the xxs fits fitted cant think of another way of saying it so i like it as it will go nicely with looser bottoms i love the sleeves the ruffles make t,1
4738,I love wideleg pants and im so glad theyre back i bought this pair in the navy and cream colors as soon as i saw them online i bought my usual size in retailer and they fit just fine the navy color is more like a dark blue but still perfect for springsummer comfortable material and overall good quality i just wish they came in more colors,1
4739,I saw this t on sale and ordered it i had second thoughts thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have well i got it today and am thrilled the fabric is so soft a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good the fit is the fit we all want in a great t nice fit not too baggy not too tight and it is so flattering it doesnt show off my tummy as so many other ts do i can wear this with jeans or a skirt so glad i got it,1
4740,Luv the loose fit and quality fabric great piece for layering,1
4741,Love love lovethe fit is amazing and truly well made this jumpsuit is a classic and it fits perfectly i just wish the button was a little bit more secure but other than that its a,1
4742,I love this top its not too fitted and falls in the right part of my waist giving me good movement i wear it to work and everyone compliments how the back is longer the top doesnt ride up your back,1
4743,The sweater had a square fit it has a chiffon ruffle at the bottom which i didnt see in the picture,1
4744,I bought these yesterday and i love them they are super comfortable and are the perfect length and size im and i tried on both the small and medium small for kicks but turns out they were a better fit the medium fit great tooalbeit a little baggy on the thigh these are now my go to pants for summer and travel i cant wait to start wearing them,1
4745,I love this shirt so i bought both colors i wish they had more colors fits great and very comfy,1
4746,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it even though the design is adorable the fabric contains acrylic and the knitted fairisle part started pilling within the first week of wear after a month and a couple washes it looks horrible and the fleece part is looking a little grungy as well so so disappointed the top is intentionally oversized and comes down to my crotch i could have easily sized down,0
4747,In love with this blouse i first got in ivory went back and got in black you can dress casual or up,1
4748,Very comfortable material is good cut out on sleeves flattering,1
4749,Beautiful dress vibrant colors fabric has a nice weight and drapes perfectly dd up top and the girls have plenty of space,1
4750,Absolutely beautiful dress im and this dress works for tall girls,1
4751,I saw this dress on line and knew i wanted it for the springsummer season i ordered it almost immediately and i am so glad i did the photo on the website doesnt do it justice there are a lot of pretty pastel colors in the paisley pattern that you just cant see on the computer screen the wrap styling is a very flattering cut for most figures especially hourglass figures like mine and the dress fits tts for reference i am and a ddd the silk material is very light and flowy and wi,1
4752,Love this vest it is super soft and cozy yet fits and lays well not bulky so its a great piece to layer over flannels it has a bit of stretch,1
4753,Very disappointed that i ordered this dress and a large was too big returned and asked for an exchange to a size medium it was apparently not available in the medium i was charged a fee for return shopping so i immediately went to website medium available and i had to pay another for shipping seems a bit unreasonable but really liked the dress,0
4754,These are the perfect light weight relaxing summer pantsthe fabric is soft and light and has some stretch so i think they can be worn more fitted way too i dont want to show off my bottom half of my body shape so these are perfect ones to be a bit loose to covers the silhouette but still looks feminine not too loose im lb and usually wear jeans petite gave me the perfect relaxed look without losing the feminine look i think could fit as well but would sn,1
4755,I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didnt matter i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days this is one of my new favorites,1
4756,It is a beautiful dress light and delicate i got my usual xsmall c lbs it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted it worked for me but i can see this being an issue it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip it is worth it very cute dress,1
4757,Stevie styled ags are my favorite love the waist love the length of the short not to long and not too short,1
4758,Im a on top with ds and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms design is both functional and attractive which usually isnt the case with swimwear love the underwire cups adjustable ties and straps and the fabric is really soft and comfortable,1
4759,My husband bought me this set for christmas and it was hands down my favorite gift these leggings let me tell you about these leggings so comfortable so cute buttonscolorpattern love they way they feel on my legs as soon as i get home from work i put them on well a lot of days i am ordering another pair i am someone who doesnt do leggings i would go as far as saying that this lounge set actually makes me feel sexy thats how much i love them,1
4760,I found this skirt to run tts i am a size and the bought the xl it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer happy girl,1
4761,I tried these on when they were full price and waited for them to go on sale and was very excited when they did im not the type to buy leather pants but these look like i can dress them up or down and dress them like jeans im a size in pants but i bought size i highly recommend,1
4762,One of the reasons i avoid skirts at all costs is because i have a bigger tummy and dont like the extra tight feeling i have of a skirt around my waist i like this skirt because of its stretchiness even wore it to a bbq where i could eat my heart out and not feel constricted at allreceived many compliments including you look like youre vacating in the caribbean,1
4763,Love this the stripes are cute and simple but even better is the texture of the fabric do a close up on the photo if you can its a swing tank so there is a lot of fabric but styled the right way and this is dreamy i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasnt quite long enough for me i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two,1
4764,This is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much dressed up or even over something casual and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy i would say it does have more of a sweater feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket its lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day i would say it fits pretty true to size i got the ivory during the big weekend sale extra off but even at,1
4765,This top is very versatile i wore it out to dinner with skinny jeans on a friday night but it can easily transition to a saturday afternoon stroll around town top,1
4766,I admit i did not intend to buy a jeandress but the cut i could not pass it up classic and vintage dress style the fringy hem and more conservative length is so fun and makes the strapless top stand out with a stunning necklace this will be a versatile piece no doubt,1
4767,Its is an absolutely gorgeous dress one of a kind you must have it in your wardrobe my seamstress needed to adjust it just a tiny bit but its truly fits to size and is emphasizing the figure,1
4768,This sweater is so much cuter in person than as pictured i bought the lovely red one today i got my usual size xs i plan to wear it more fitted as a top rather than as a jacket although i can still layer it if i want the color is divine the weight is just right not too heavy but not too light sometimes peplums overwhelm me but this one did not it hits at just the right spots and is flattering all over particularly making my waist look small,1
4769,I was on the fence about this toposition because as others have stated it is quite billowy at the bottom just before returning i decided to try it on with a navy linen vneck cardi and it completely changed my mind wow now i am not saying that this isnt beautiful on its own becauseit truly is i am just saying that now this has become a truly versatile piece in my wardrobe i did not order a petite even though i am and for that in am glad i ordered regular size xs lbsb,1
4770,I wish i could buy this is more colors so easy to dress up or dress down,1
4771,I was so excited to get this top and while it is soooo amazingly soft i still could not keep it i must admit that i am only so i do think this had quite a bit to do with my dislike of this but i felt like a matador which is definitely not what i was going for maybe if your tall and lean this would work but for me no way,0
4772,This top is a great versatile long sleeved shirt im and the sleeves were long for me so i dont know why its listed as length i could see where sleeve length would be a problem for more petite ladies the wine color is beautiful it is slightly more fitted than the picture i was afraid it might be semisheer but its totally fine i wish it was a bit longer in the torso but its not short like some sweaters this season i do tend to have a shorter torso so a tall lady with a l,1
4773,Love these chinos they are so soft have the right amount of stretch for a curvy figure and the colors are great i have purchased the khaki and blue so far the blue color has the perfect washedfaded look i love that they have petite sizes available i will be stocking up on the other colors,1
4774,I just bought the grey and now im coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item so soft fits great,1
4775,I love this dress the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments i also love its made in the usa my only wish is that the chambray version was as great its not the pockets are cut bad its cut smaller in the chest and made in china,1
4776,This is my favorite pair so far from cartonnier the side zip dresses up the pants which is something i was looking for and i just love the print so happy with the quality i ordered a second pair fit true to size for me i plan to wear them with knee high boots as it gets colder,1
4777,Love this dress swingy is definitely the right descriptor as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size it runs slightly large so if youre between sizes i would size down,1
4778,Gorgeous this dress fit so well and it super flattering i got it in green and the colors are just lovely i had to get it hemmed because im short and i couldnt find it in petite but definitely worth the extra cost i love love love it,1
4779,This top is the perfect staple the fabric is soft and comfortable i generally wear medium tops but the small fits perfectly took the chance ordering online and i am very happy,1
4780,This dress is so soft and cozy and pretty love the shine and interesting sheen whenever you move very comfortable and looks great with a variety of layers i want to buy more colors but right now i just have the mauve ordered size m and im,1
4781,I have worn this with a tank and shorts and know it will be a great fall piece over a long sleeve tee the pattern is pretty and the fabric is soft and warm it can be casual or dressed up this product is true to the picture what you see is what you get,1
4782,Was really excited for this dress and couldnt be more disappointed doesnt look anything like the picturesthe fabric feelscheap it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess looking beyond that i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly unfortunately not the top half doesnt sit correctly its so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design it doesnt sit on your shoulders but doesnt look right off your shoulders the neckline is very high also front b,0
4783,I loved this top it was my go to top even in the heat the fabric is light and breathes however pulled it out of the washing mashing to find that the sleeve has shredded away from the body it could not be repaired i am so disappointed as i really loved everything about it,0
4784,This suit is so flattering on great support and slimming for my postthree times baby body i ordered this suit and the skirted maillot by swim by retailer in the white floral i loved the pattern of the floral more but dont think any chest size larger than a c cup would be supported in that suit,1
4785,While you cant count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item these photos are way off instead of the warm charcoal i see online the pants are more of a dusty blue the material has very little stretch and i couldnt get into the size s the s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist for reference i usually wear a size in brands like for all mankind and citizens of humanity,0
4786,Like the style of a blazer but the fabric of denim looking forward to pairing with dresses and black pants,1
4787,Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit these jeans are the best new addition to your collection the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out they do come extremely long so they will most likely need to be hemmed i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way if youre debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend id go with these,1
4788,And the bottom looks like a tutu first i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly second the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt finally the color on the green one is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint back it goes,0
4789,The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in personjust received it and far exceeded my wildest expectationsit is elegant classy and an understated sexythe colors are rich and vibrantgorgeous shades of plum and bluea unique color combination that is gorgeousthe open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wowbeautiful and flattering fitit is a i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size but slig,1
4790,Fabulous colors great fabric super comfy and extremely versatile i love love love this skirt although im only the regular was still above my knee so it might be a bit short for really tall gals the waistband is a bit wide but with a cropped top or tying a button down as shown i found it very flattering love the texture of the fabric and the slightly retro print and it doesnt seem to wrinkle after getting out the original packaging creases it honestly goes with everything a,1
4791,We were at dinner in provence at sunset and in walked a young lady wearing this lavender dusty blue lilac creation just swingy enough to be perfectly comfortable yet lacy enough to be elegant the color struck me as southoffrance they were american by accent i was too shy to ask the brand of her dress but knew by the powers of the internet that this dress would one day be mine magnolia lace dress i found you,1
4792,I got the blue it is very short one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust only flattering on small busted models,0
4793,The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design it looks very elegant and romantic you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though because of the design of the straps it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath overall very pretty and i would highly recommend i purchased the white and yellow version,1
4794,I loved this tshirt when i first tried it on a good cutnot too drapey or fitted but then i washed it laid flat to dry and it shrunk so much that its unwearable now so disappointing,0
4795,I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer however the quality is very poor it feels like it might fall apart after one clean also the buttons where not sewn on properly i wear an xs and the size was a good fit but the overall quality was not worth the price or even close to it,0
4796,I was hesitant in purchasing these without trying them on first but im happy i did they are higher quality than the typical legging the sizing runs bigger than average,1
4797,I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build in arms as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug this dress was perfect and so soft fit me like a glove i have a long torso and am so its a little short but throw on some tights and booties and its perfect im a size and got a large,1
4798,These are the most flattering pair of white jeans i have ever found people stop me when i wear them and ask me where i purchased them and the name of the brand flattering comfortable and perfect for a casual weekend or going out highly recommend,1
4799,This sweater is very long could be worn as a dress at,0
4800,I purchased this dress for my th birthday bash it was stunning the fit was perfect i did buy it a size up but could have worn my regular size it is incredibly flattering and elegant very well made one of my go to black dresses for the summer,1
4801,I find that petite gals with short muscular legs can have a hard time finding cropped pants that fit right the flare on these makes the pants oh so flattering the material is nice and thick and holds you in the colors and patterns are beautiful fall colors quite lovely and subtle there is a nice stretch to the pant the waist has nice closures cant wait to weer these i ordered the p and htey fit perfectly lbs in wiast,1
4802,Just bought this in navy and love the easy versatility of it the other colors in the print including some black can be worn as is with a cardi denim jacket leggingstights and boots etc i found the fit to be somewhat loose in my usual size particularly in the chest im a and length was long enough to not need leggings in springsummer at the neckline is cut somewhat low but retains modesty in my opinion because of how narrow of a v it is dont feel need for cami very,1
4803,Soft pretty socks a little big if you have smaller feet im a size and they are a tad too big but still comfortable,1
4804,Loved this online and even better in person inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt,1
4805,I love this sweater love the length its a bit loose and delicate compared to what i usually wear but looks great with boots and leggings love the sheer fabric across the bottom of the back the loose bows on the sides and the drape of the fabric all combine to make a great sweater runs true to size has a loose fit but you dont feel like you are drowning in fabric like some loose fitting cardigans,1
4806,This vest is awesome it can take any dressoutfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color,1
4807,This was a very odd fitting top i should have read the description more closely the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places,0
4808,I had to go up one size but i love this blouse dressy enough for work and you can make it casual with jeans tight across the chest but the next size up fit perfect,1
4809,This is a very well made sweater it is a nice weight great for cool mornings and evenings i dont think you can dress this up but it is perfect with casual pants and jeans i found it runs large but that makes it suitable for layering over other tops,1
4810,This is such a pretty dress i was worried the arm holes would be too big since it was hard to see them in the pictures but they are perfect there is a built in red slip underneath it is so cute on and really flattering by itself or even with some white skinny crop jeans underneath,1
4811,Wow i have never owned a pair of pants that fit so well this is my first pair of pants from retailer i always have the too tight in the thighs and gaping at the waist issue but not with these at all i was so surprised i purchases size in both tan and blue the perfect amount of stretch and so comfortable a bit long but flares look best with heals anyway,1
4812,I wore this dress to work the other day and got so many compliments on the fit and the design the wrap on the top i got it in grey and its a beautiful color for winter the dress is very comfortable to wear,1
4813,Love this shirt it is great quality and fits true to size in a comfy not too fitted way that a button down should fit i love that it is a classic white cotton shirt with a modern edge with the little bit of fringing on the bottom and sleeve cuffs its great to wear with jeans or leggings and i can even see dressing it up or down depending on the accessories worn i have already gotten lots of compliments when wearing iteveryone wants to get it for themselves id even get it in another co,1
4814,I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself its beautiful material and has lovely detail a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesnt have a lot of stretch,1
4815,Super comfortable and cute i have received tons of compliments one this dress the material is soft and the printcolors are awesome this dress will get a lot of use over fall winter and spring runs a little big i am typically a s but chose the xs love love love,1
4816,Couldnt resist this jacket its perfect for business casual dress code for staying warm in airconditioned offices and goes with many colors and stylesmany times jackets are too tight on my shoulders or not long enough for my arms and this fits perfectly im and i bought a medium,1
4817,Bought this in store at full price its that pretty black white embroidery pintucks throw it on with capris and flats and you are polished and comfy my only prob was i had to buy a little large size as size was already sold out i am lbs,1
4818,I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much sadly no first of all they run small i am between a s and xs in most brands bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side these felt a little snug and short but i decided to keep them the first time i washed them they were ruined i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer plus a delicate cycle no dryer the lace is man,0
4819,Wasnt sure what to expect but got this on sale and glad i didit is much prettier in person soft and silkygreat fit also and versatile mix and match,1
4820,I love the length of the dress and the fun swing the skirt has the print is wonderful,1
4821,Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it it is so comfortable and flattering its too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you cant see the ruching across the front a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer and i generally wear a the small fit well will probably be back for the black,1
4822,I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size i checked online and my size was available so i ordered i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasnt and i didnt it looked great i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller i cant wait to wear it on cool fall days,1
4823,This has been my go to top for cooler days so comfortable and soft i would say it runs tts with a little bit of a lose fit i am c and usually wear s and the s fit me well i could have gone down in size but liked this to be a bit loser to wear over skinny jeans and leggings,1
4824,I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them they are comfortable and a great casual look i bought two more pairs in different colors on line,1
4825,The light red color is really nice i ordered an xs but usually order small because of the cut and it was perfect the fabric is heavy but loose the collar stands up nicely and the buttons lay flat i purchased this beautiful piece on sale but i would have paid full price,1
4826,I am pounds and i bought the p the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating very flattering lines i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays as other reviewers said it is adorable and a winner,1
4827,Perfect fit great material torn in just the right places cant wait to see the stevie jeans for the fall esp in corduroy,1
4828,I love these shorts theyre really comfortable and versatile i got them on sale and for the price they were a steal the material is nice and you can dress them up or down,1
4829,This dress is a winner the material is not stiff like many neoprene dresses it is soft and silky and has amazing drape the dress is very flattering the material is very stretchy even through the waist so it is and easy perfect fit on different body types i loved the shorter versions of the dress but they werent workable for me but this length is perfect and there are pockets that are sewn in with perfect detailing they dont stick out or disturb the line of the dress,1
4830,Great dress wonderful on hourglass and skinny straight shaped girlslove the color combination and fit,1
4831,Saw this on the retailer emails as a cover and knew i had to try it on went into the store following day and tried it to my delight the tencel fabric is light enough for southern california weather and can be worn as a trench coat over skinny jeans leggings or dresses or act as a dress in itself love the navy color as it is has more of a washed looked and not too bold what attracted me to this piece in the first place was the ruffled bottom and the rounded flaps on the back that is different,1
4832,When i saw this on a model at my retailer store i fell for it i love the colors and the weave of this kimono it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular it will be useful for cooler days and nights or airconditionied places the knit cuffs hold it in place i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it,1
4833,I loved this dress when i saw it however the fit was way off i am lbs and the small was way too big from the waist down when the xs arrived i was sure it would be perfect unfortunately the waist hit way too high above my rib cage and the dress was too short it was as if it was a petite size i was very disappointed as this is such a pretty easy dress to just throw on for school unfortunately neither size looked right on me and i had to return both the material is also not the s,0
4834,I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness it is from cloth and stone a brand i like usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation,1
4835,This sweater totally caught my eye online and when it arrived it was even better than on the website gorgeous colorskind of a retro look but more modern and updated very happy with my purchase,1
4836,I love this more than my pineapple top i am lbs and wear between a size in tops got this in size same as the pineapple and fits perfectly and comfotably the color is white and has a lovely lace pattern i would say it runs a litle on the small side material is a bit more stiff than my pineapple top but i love the way it feels in my opinion this is a staple top you can dress it up for a wedding or just going out its super lovely they were so popular at the retailer near me tw,1
4837,I bought this in the blue and you should definitely size down it runs very large its amazingly comfortable and high quality great length as well not too short and not too long it has a partial lining so its not necessary to wear a slip which i love i get compliments every time i wear it even one of the saleswomen in retailer asked me where i got the dress she was surprised when i told her it was from retailer from online i liked it so much i just ordered the red plaid,1
4838,Count me in as a five star lover of this dress the details are so rich and interesting so be prepared to get noticed when wearing im happy to say that getting the size medium regular instead of petite was a good choice for my top heavy frame the chest is fitted but not tight the length is a nottooshort above knee the tiered layers swing so nicely and the beadssequins add a touch is whimsy to the design my one negative is the tassels at the neck tiesoo heavy cumbersome to style o,1
4839,This shirt is exactly what i expected it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great its the perfect shirt for summer loose fitting but in a flattering way the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colorsi highly recommend it,1
4840,This tunic fits exactly as shown and is so comfortable the fabric is soft and buttery and the lace up front is a awesome detail happy that i went with the nondenim color because its a gorgeous rich color that i think will transition well from season to season love a good cutr machinewashable tunic,1
4841,The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return,0
4842,After reading the reviews stating that this dress was a tent and only fit for the tall and small chested i kind of had a battle of wills in my head over ordering it it is very me but me is also curvy and possessing a g bust i had to post a review because i received the dress today and i actually love it i ordered a and i love the fit i know its flowy but on me its far from tentlike i think its great now as a prefall piece with some sandals and a jean jacket and as,1
4843,Fits really nicely and im picky about sleeves but these are just right a little see through but i dont have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice,1
4844,I can not speak highly enough about this shirt i originally bought the navy one and then went back to purchase the other two colors the material is soft and thin without being flimsy the fit is very flattering,1
4845,When i read car coat i expect a little more weight it really is just a thin long blazer also the colors appear different online i expected a redmaroon with bue and white stripe so maybe i misread completely it is actually brownmustardbeige combo not what i expected so it will be a return,0
4846,The photo of this dress does not do it justice this dress is absolutely gorgeous the construction is very high quality i always worry about peekaboos with button front dresses as i am very busty total nonissue with this dress the petite fit is also spot on it is slightly large in the back bodice for me but i always have that problem its an easy tailoring fixi think im in love with byron lars,1
4847,Much lower quality than other robes i have purchased,0
4848,Thank goodness they had a special discount because i love this sweater it is not normal for me to splurge but there was something about this sweater and it didnt disappoint too cute a great top to wear to a concert or a relaxed party i love it,1
4849,Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality the fabric was very thin easily stretched out of shape price is ridiculous for this item,0
4850,Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool lining in a mustard color i did a cold water wash and flat to dry i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching i am so disappointed bc i loved this top,0
4851,The shirt is a heavier weight than how it looks on the product page which was a nice surprise it has a boxy shape and was shorter than expected im and the front of the shirt above the hips the design and color is great very happy overall,1
4852,I just bought these last week and have had a hard time wearing anything else they are super comfortable with great pockets very flattering and wash up great wish they made more colors,1
4853,I am normally a straightforward since i saw the other review i ordered down to an i am still swimming in iti would say i have about inches of extra fabric in the waisthips this is sized way too large i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool but i wont find out cause im returning iton the bright side i might fit a which would be pretty nice,0
4854,I just received this and wore it immediately it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern peeks out giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not seethrough it is a fine knit and has a satinlike thread to it which makes it soft and cool perfect for a summer day it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite lb and i think this would run closer to tts,1
4855,This vest is sooo cute i bought the red really a dark burgundy and it is perfect for fall i wanted to buy the other color but its sold out online im and the length is fine im usually an xs or at retailer and the regular xss is the perfect size i am on the busty side and doesnt make me feel too heavy like some vests,1
4856,Very cute and great fit i removed the belt its removable for a different look,1
4857,I love this dress,1
4858,Love retailers kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it unfortunately when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me off went to wear it for the first time there was already a huge snag in it i love retailer but for this is not worth your money,0
4859,So different loose linen i love the raw edge and the color i can wear with anything over a dressgreat top with raw edges,1
4860,I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors the black for some reason only available to order in store the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch ive purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small im lbs c and and typically wear an xs at retailer this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem i cant wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies,1
4861,Love the mara hoffman basketweave bikini bottoms in fractals red i went to her website for the size chart and got these in a size m very good fit just a bit cheekier than her classic cut bikini bottoms i got them with the matching basketweave bikini topim currently to depending on where i measure upper hipbones are fuller thighs and bottom so i never know what to order i think a size s would be too skimpy so i hope these hold up well in the waves co,1
4862,I finally found these jeans love them and have been wearing them almost everyday,1
4863,Had to have these when i saw them online usually an ag girl but loved the button fly and boyfriend fit originally ordered a and returned for a after a couple of wears wish i bought the a must have,1
4864,This dress is amazing i have to say when i picked it up to try it on i thought it would just be an ok dress but i thought might as well try it on to my surprise it was more than perfect the waste cinches in when it is zip it up and the blousing in the chest fits lovely,1
4865,I went to the store to buy the transcend verdugo ankle in blue howeveri left with it in blue and black the black is perfect absolutely amazing fabric that shapes your behind and no ones is more imperfect than mine i cant say enough about these except paige rocks im a fan,1
4866,This top is soft feeling and i appreciate that its lined its light weight and feminine but no camisole is needed when you take it off the shoulder area feels tight so you need to be a little gentle but its gorgeous and you should get it im a c and i got a,1
4867,I bought this dress to wear to an out of state wedding first time wearing when i tied the strap the pull through at the top of the halter broke with minimal stress i sewed it back with a repair kit from the hotel but was worried the whole night the dress would not hold up if this is all that is holding the dress on it should be more secure with reinforced stitching beautiful material and comfortable,0
4868,The fit of the top is true to size but i really dont like the taupe terryclothlike sweatshirt under the white lace the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe it is terrible paired together i also didnt like the feel of the terryclothlike fabric against my skin even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail im absolutely sending it back,0
4869,I thought this dress looked gorgeous on the model so floaty and light when it came i found it to be the exact opposite the hem is so heavy and laid on me like a potato sack it had way too much material at the bottom and weighed me down unfortunately,0
4870,This is a lovely jacket it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocketdetail they are not actual pockets though which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy i am a standard xsxxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly if you use the clasp it actually looks bigger regardless i love it and was o,1
4871,This is a great shirt with cute details including the ruffled back i am petite and needed to shorten the sleeves but otherwise the fit was true to size and not too baggy or too tight the material feels avergage in quality but looks polished with navy blue pants i received several compliments during my first wear overall a very cute shirt,1
4872,This shirt fits beautifully though might be tight for the large chested the fabrics is very soft and the look classic and feminine,1
4873,I love this sweater and dont think the pics do it justice i ordered the light bluelavender color and couldnt be happier its great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots i received many compliments the one time ive worn it so far so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldnt have hesitated to pay full price,1
4874,In contrast to the other reviewer i love this dress worth the sale price at least,1
4875,This top can be dressed up or down very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo blue i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in i think it might be too short otherwise,1
4876,Mine came smelling like gasoline not sure why but i would have kept it otherwise its a smell that will be really hard to get out looks like the picture,0
4877,I absolutely adore this cardigan its easy so comfortable stylish and absolutely flattering on every shape what i love about it most is how long it is im and the large and xl come well below my bum its perfect to wear with leggings and boots when im having a relaxing easy day but i can easily dress it up with denim or a dress underneath totally versatile i originally bought this in a large and it fit well but then we got the xl in the store and i snagged that one too because i,1
4878,Wearing this today it fits true is size is machine washable the slits make it unique dont hesitate to purchase this one,1
4879,Living in florida i thought the design of this sweatshirt was to die for i was so pleased with the quality when i received the top however i was nervous to see that it recommended washing before wearing due to the dying process i washed cold gentle cycle and tumble dried low turned out perfect and did not shrink its adorable plan to wear it with white denim shorts i ordered a size and i normally wear a size small,1
4880,This sweater is substantial wellmade fabric is thick and comfortable the length is on the shorter side not cropped but shorter perhaps if they had petite ti would be cropped the sleeves are perfect length too on me it looks shorter on the model they hit at mys wrists i do usually need petite length it seems a simple top but it is quite beautiful in person i strongly recommend it even for the pricexs and i am lbs dd chest in waist,1
4881,Tried it on in store and had to have it so soft and easy to throw on im and it hits at the knee i usually wear an xs or small in tops and the xs fit great,1
4882,This open cardigan runs really big and has way too much fabric even going down a size i felt like i was swimming in it,0
4883,After washing this top pilled terribly it is beautiful but only for one use,0
4884,I really like the hyphen pilcro chino pants so i figured i would try the shorts and voila i love the shorts too colors are great and you dont have to cuff them if they seem too short theyre versatile and who doesnt love options,1
4885,The perfect summer top paired with a small tank underneath and jeans and had many compliments,1
4886,Love the colors and pattern i am normally a ml i ordered a large as thats all they had in stock and it fits fine though the medium would probably have fit a little better for me it is very long even for me and im,1
4887,You know how you look in your closet and things just say im perfect for today this top is like that i got it a few weeks ago and have worn it often because it is so easy and hangs really nice i bought the black one and am considering the off white one,1
4888,This is a lovely top sooo soft very flattering draping if you have a bit of a tummy i wasnt sure about it on the hanger but was pleasantly surprised when i tried it on very glad i have it a chance,1
4889,I love this sweater i ordered the xs because i have very narrow hips and i didnt want it to be too baggy it fits a little like a very short sweater dress on me what i really love is that the arms are nice and long one of my pet peeves is sweaters that are compromised in arm length i bought the pink and plan to get at least one other color too,1
4890,I was leery when i ordered this as i read the reviews and im busty it is perfect for me just wear a little bandeau underneath im lbs and d bra size also the length is perfect ill be wearing this little number winter and summer here in fl will look just as cute with boots and long sweater and did i mention it has pockets,1
4891,This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives i love the fact that its lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice has a good solid quality feel to it it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest more on the conservative side of retailer,1
4892,In a word clingy and not in good way long so you need it to flow not cling liked the back but front was just too clingy back it goes,0
4893,I ordered the navygray version in size xl it fits me true to size matching the online photos the colors matched too the fabric is so soft its warm while being lighter in weight very comfortable the collar wasnt bulky either its made to last one of my retailer favorites,1
4894,Just the perfect weight for summer wear falls gently over tummy without being too long and the ruffled edge and quirky uneven length make it just interesting enough to make it feel like more than just a tee shirt i got it in black and reordered in pale blue and am hoping the lighter color is not seethrough this is a nice buy on sale and can be dressed up or casual it feels and wears great but i have not washed it so gave it a good on quality if it washes well then an excellent would be,1
4895,I love this tunic super flattering long enough if your no super tall like me to wear with leggings it does run a little big i like tops a little looser on me so i didnt mind that i ordered a small if your typically a small and prefer more fitted tops i would suggest sizing down i bought the blue tunic first the pictures dont do the textile design justice i loved it so much i went back online and purchased this tunic in blackthanks retailer for being awesome,1
4896,I cant say enough good things about this piece high quality in structure and design when i initially put it on i worried that i might have ordered a size too small so i was pleasantly surprised to realize this dress fits like a glove but has enough give in all of the right places to let you eat dance breath etc i received tons of complimentsof note i am lbs and i wore a size wanting another event that i can wear this to as i wore it to a work xmas party,1
4897,Gorgeous skirt runs a bit big well made perfect for the office and super comfy,1
4898,Just got these in black and they look great they are a great combination of classy and casual with the added bonus of being super soft they are however very fittingslender but give a little with wear as others have mentioned they do run a little small so sizing up one was the right decision at they fall at just right place on my ankle great pant overall always love pilcro,1
4899,I bought this in aqua the color is beautiful the quality of the cashmere is great i have worn this times since purchasing this can be dressed up or down the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf flattering hem line very versatile,1
4900,Great causal tank the back is a bitter longer than the front im and the backmodel shot was right on for where it his me at the hipbutt the material is a polyspandexrayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give i go between a medium and small in most retailer tanks and like to achieve a look that is somewhere in between formfitting and flowy quick stats lbs c and the small was perfect without being too tight across the chest,1
4901,I loved this top i paired it with he ag stevie short and jasper and jeera beaded sandals look was super cute and casual i love the fact you can adjust the fit in the back with the lace up detailing flowly tank without the maternity look i went with the lavender color and it looks great with my olive skin i had no problem with sheerness when wearing a nude bra for reference i am lbs and went with the small,1
4902,I immediatley bought this adorable dress after trying it on at my local retailer and absolutely love it it fits tts for me in my regular size small d and its incredibly soft and comfortable to wear the top portion is so great as it has nice short sleeves the color is a nice deep rich orange which looks great now in the summer but will look especially cute in the fall with tall boots and a light denim jacket plus the bottom half is cut in such an interesting way the material is amaz,1
4903,I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing it fit really well and was flattering the only time i laundered it i hand washed it in cold water and hung it to dry the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places the sleeves are now tight and way too short the overall length shortened by at least inches the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open im very disappointed and surprisedi will be returning it as it is unwearable as is,0
4904,Top fiits true to size im and avg bra size i orderd a and it is greati love the colors and the fabric is realy nice what i would expect for this price point the slit at the neck is not too low to be revealing this would work well with jeans and just as well with dress pants for work,1
4905,Love these pants i have several pairs of the pilcro scrip and formerly super script these do not have quite as much elastic as some cuts but they still fit well and look great,1
4906,This dress is very clever fabric is on thicker side so it eliminates any worries about dimples or imperfections the tie at neck line is effortlessly sexy and not at all trashy as another reviewer felt you could tie it if you didnt want any cleave or leave it looser for more casual look i got the small bc i felt comfortable with a little cling given how forgiving the fabric was it still showed shape when i walked i was surprised to like it as much as i did husband insisted i get it becau,1
4907,I oot this dress in the blue it fits greathits at the knee not too short or awkwardly long i just wish they had it in short sleeve so i could wear one for the summer beautiful and easy to wear for work or fun,1
4908,I am short and curvy and pilcro has the best fitting most comfortable and most cute jeans around i buy exclusively pilcro now these jeans were excellent,1
4909,This is a beautiful sweater soft lovely color and easy to wear the current photo is more true to the length i am and pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips,1
4910,I got this jacket after being inspired by the looks from stranger things and love that the fuzzy collar style is coming back i tend to wear medium shirts and large jacketscoats to fit my long arms and the sleeves are a great length for me the lining has a gorgeous pattern on the inside too the buttons were difficult to button at first but became easier over time as the fabric softened i also bought a pilcro skirt and its comfortable too so overall im very happy with this brand,1
4911,Great fit for reference i am lbs and bought a size medium there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up soft fabric and falls beautifully,1
4912,For the last two years i have only purchased clothing for myself if it is secondhand but then i saw this skirt and succumbed to temptation first of all the print is gorgeous im a sucker for blue and white anything so it wasnt that hard of a sell as other reviewers have mentioned the seams line up this kind of quality is so hard to find in clothing items anymore and really makes the skirt seem much more pricey than it really is if youre buying it on sale like i did im and will,1
4913,I ordered first the green then the grey in case the green was mismarkedso shortis this to be in keeping with the ankle pant trendanyone who wants a shorter pant could easily hem them but there is no way to lengthen themi held the new pants up to an older pair from previous years they are a full inches shorter wownote how in the photo of the golden color pants they barely skim the models ankle thats how they are in real lifei wear these pants in a tall and live,0
4914,Im wearing this shirt right now im usually a large in tops i bought a medium and im kinda wishing i got a small instead its very swingy its super cute but size down at least one size maybe two,1
4915,I really wanted to love this dress two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan which gives the outfit definition and elegance but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my b top i chose size m because of the length the small was shorter in front i am in the end i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet but it will be stunning on the right person,1
4916,I ordered a small but it was way to big it was very soft,0
4917,Love this coat the colour is vibrant and it is well made it does however run small for me it was two sizes i am usually a p and ended up purchasing the p glad i tried it on in a store it is a good springfall coat as it is lightweight if i had purchased the p i could layer it a bit more good but though just be sure to size up,1
4918,Love this top it is just gorgeous and fits great,1
4919,Love the fabric and the casual way this jacket drapes the color is nice i bought the blue usually wear petite sizes but they were sold out so bought the misses in medium and it works perfect like i can layer it for summerfall since its very light weight fabric,1
4920,I just received this blouse and love itmore beautiful in personi got the black one in a petite and it is perfectif you want it longer in the front order a regular,1
4921,Noticed all the star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets so due to the past years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeansi was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula thick denim just the right amount of give and a flattering inch rise walked right in and found them and i knew right when i touched them they were still the thin denim thats nowhere near the quality they once were consumers pay attention and t,0
4922,I ordered the floral version of this swimsuit what you cant really tell from the images is the darling lavender stripe design that is in set opposite the floral its truly a darling suit and very well made the fit is very flattering with oddly enough a conservative yet sexy appeal i ordered a medium after reading the size up recommendations from other consumers but ive exchanged it for a small the cup size was overexaggerated in the medium and i had plenty of breathing room i,1
4923,Just bought this today in xl and i like it a lot i am very busty so if i see an xl in most things i will try it on i probably could have fit into a large though this will look cute with leggings as it is long enough to cover your butt i didnt know about the emerald color as it looked in store lights but it is more bluegreen at home i like it even better well worth,1
4924,I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall it fit very true to size i usually wear and the m fit perfect the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra love this top,1
4925,This top is too short so much so that tucking it in would be difficult the designs are lovely but the short length is putting this top back on the rack,0
4926,I love this style and was pleasantly surprised that it fit my curvy shape well despite it being a fairly straight shift style it does wrinkel easily because of the linen fabric but otherwise is really perfect it is dressy enough for bridal showers or brunches but could also be worn casually,1
4927,This has quickly become my favorite dress i bought the turquoise dress and the color is so lovely the fit is perfect and the lines are flattering and classic this is one of those dresses that will never go out of style,1
4928,Great shirt i bought the red penguins and its adorable i am returning it however bc the size i bought was too big with that said it was my error not the brand i think it runs true to size,1
4929,I loved this tshirt in the gray motif so much went back to get the yellow both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos while the fabric is a little thin its super soft and just the perfect length,1
4930,Bought this online to get something in the purple family its a deeper hue than pictured and as others have noted there are variations in the color all over cute with jeans definitely an upgrade from a boring old t one word to the wisesaw the pink in the store today definitely not pinkits orange im lbs and b bought xs and it is perfect,1
4931,I am consistently a size in pilcro jeans and these are no exception these are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am but i still love them i found them to be true to size because they dont have much stretch they are a little snug in the thigh at first but the denim gives a bit throughout the day the shorter length with the little flare is so versatile they look great with a dressy top and heels and just as good with a cozy sweater and flat chelsea boots love pilcro,1
4932,Yes this is a great dress i wasnt sure about it online because of the color combination i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices who isnt once i received it and tried it on oh wow i love it it is so flattering it is a very pretty dress i think i will wear this all the time i am actually thinking of all the d,1
4933,The embroidery grabbed my attention but i loved the way it felt once i tried it on the fit is loose im between a small and medium and the small was a bit loose but still flattering i really love everything about it even the lighter weight fabric i live in the south were fall and winter tend to be on the warmer side the vneck is just perfect i can see wearing this to work as well as out one of the most versatile dresses ive found lately,1

4936,dd i saw this dress online and thought it was beautiful but considered not buying it because of other comments that the bust was too small for women with more curves fortunately the lovely blue dress was in my local retailer store and i decided to try it on in a size i think the dress fits perfectly and i have gotten many compliments including from random strangers i have had no problem with a tight zipper or a low back which is perfectly able to cover my bra in the back th,1
4937,I was nervous to order the pants because i didnt think they looked great on the model in the picture they are by far my new favorite pants the fabric is so soft and stretchy yet hugs my curves doesnt stretch out during the day i was expecting the fabric to be thick or stiff but it is very lightweight yet professional for work the cut is perfecti wanted black culottes but im only so a lot of them overwhelm me these are fitted at the top and gradually looser through the thighs a,1
4938,Why is it so difficult to find a shirt that doesnt expose half of my bra if i lift my arm this is cute beyond the arm hole issue but overpriced going back,0
4939,Perfect fit did not lose its shape thicker material great quality for a great price definitely a wardrobe staple can be dressed up or down work business appropriate fits tts for reference i am lbs and the petite fits perfect falls right above ankle like pictured if they had more colours i would get them too,1
4940,Love this shirt i am actually pregnant and this shirt ties right over my baby bump to make for a very flattering pregnancy shirt i will definitely be wearing it post pregnancy as well since the tie is an actual tie and you can tie it however tight you want for a more fitted or loose look i am lbs not pregnant and got a size small and it fits perfectly covers problems areas of butt and upper thighs yet accentuates the waist and thinner area of legs very soft fabric a bit stretc,1
4941,What a cute top its a little on the short side for me but im keeping it because it is so pretty the lace is lightweight and delicate but seems like it will hold up pretty well trying to decide what to wear under it but i think it could look cute with a cami for work or even a cute bra that has some coverage for super casual days the lace is completely sheer but doesnt feel as revealing as i would expect would be super cute over a swim top with jean shorts and sandalswish i li,1
4942,This hoodie has a great fit it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy in fact it is quite flattering it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull the hood is a nice size not overwhelming to the back profile i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this now i have a super cute lounge at the lake ensemble,1
4943,This fits like a regular top for me i can take petite on top most of the time i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops i think its so cute on its light weight enough for warmer weather im going to love it this springsummer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan another plus is it doesnt gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts its not so low cut on me either but i have a f ish inches bust so that may be why it,1
4944,The shape is flattering on my postpartum body even though the material is stretchy cotton and the shirt fits well across my shoulders and chest the swing shape hides my stomach area the material doesnt seem particularly breathable so you might want to avoid wearing it in really hot humid weather but for my summers in the pacific northwest itll be fine,1
4945,I purchased both the floral sleep shorts and the top the floral watercolor pattern is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft like the other reviewers i appreciate the feminine quality of this set while also being able to run around the house i am lbs and purchased a s,1
4946,Love this tank it has an easy fit that hides my post baby belly with out looking to wide,1
4947,When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled they were comfy as yoga pants and the fit was divine i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out saggy and fadedso disappointing i want my back,0
4948,I love everything about this skirt the fabric is super comfy and it drapes wonderfully fits great a bit long for me as im but totally worth it i dont wear heels so i might need to alter the length but i knew it would be long when i ordered it i purchased the grey but i might have to order the taupe as well,1
4949,Love these pants the color is a true red and they are very flattering on i ordered the but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing just reordered the size,1
4950,Im so glad i splurged on this sweater coat wow this is the kind of product i come to retailer from very unique good quality flattering and surprisingly soft i wore this over a sleeveless dress for a few hours and not only was i very warm my arms werent itchy or irritated at all on the contrary it was quite comfortable and soft this is a bit pricey but i will definitely get good use of it i found it to run true to size i typically wear a and ordered a small my only quibb,1
4951,I was very excited to receive these pants and wished they had worked out as the fabric is structured and yet comfortable however while stretchy they looked very tight on the thigh and yet were too big in the waist i will acknowledge im a runner with somewhat muscular legs but was hopeful these pants wouldnt cling to them for reference im lbs and usually wear a size in pants,0
4952,This dress is beautiful and so striking in its unique design i ordered a as that is what i usually wear about halfway up my body i knew it was not even going to zip i did not even try i love the fabric and colors so much though that i am going to try a heres hoping it works,1
4953,Saw on my way out of the store and had to try them on they are very comfortable and surprisingly cute the jogger style usually doesnt flatter my curvier body but these have a drape to the fabric that made them look so much nicer i took in two sizes my usual small and a medium since i just had my second child and still have some post baby weight i still went with the small after trying on both though the medium was a bit too big and shapeless the small was comfortable and looked better t,1
4954,Weave on the sweater quite open and easily snags the first day i wore it the seam on the sleeve began to unravel needed to use a crochet hook to reweave after the first wearing not confident that it will hold up well to its first wash,0
4955,This dress is a vintage s drop hem style not meant to be tight to form that said the bottom is loose so may want to size down lbs s i bought the neutral navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus hints of peach and beautiful lace detail i literally got compliments all day long from friends and strangers i paired it with a dark denim jacket absolute must have for sale price,1
4956,I agree with another reviewer who said to get these while you can the fish print is adorable and you cant beat the style and uniqueness for this price i am lbs with long legs and a thicker waist normally wear size in pants and purchased these in size small i would definitely recommend sizing down the mediums fit me ok but the small was more flattering overall while still being roomy and having lots of flow cant wait to wear these,1
4957,Agree with the other reviewers this top is excellent great length weight bounce to it flattering without being clingy im with a long torso so im always in the market for tops with longer hemlines and decent material without being too tight or clingy this one i love i bought it in black then went back for the turquoise then two more if that doesnt tell you what a great shirt this is i dont know what will,1
4958,This top really pays attention to detail it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i dont need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place very thoughtful the top seems to run true to size and fits well neither the arm holes or the vneck are too low i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size im a dd and the fit perfectly also the colors in t,1
4959,Fit is oversized but intentional flattering on love the neckline modesty might call for a tank top underneath if bending over fabric is soft stretchy and has a good quality heft to it,1
4960,The colors on these leggings are just beautiful the material is very soft and has a nice thickness to it no issues with see thru material i am and i ordered my usual medium,1
4961,I fell in love with this dress online and went to try on in the store im lbs with some boobs usually a s or size i tried on the s and xs and ended up buying the xs and ive never worn an xs in my life it is long and loose hanging right at my knees the body is roomy and i am thinking of having it taken in a couple of inches at the waist there is pleating in the front that begins just below my natural waist and extends out to the hips plus pockets the sleeves are lon,1
4962,I love ag for their soft stretchy denim and flattering fit bought these today and couldnt be happier i usually order stevies in the petite ankle size but the regular capri length fit perfectly skimmed my ankle,1
4963,The color is great a nice alternative to all my black tights good quality,1
4964,Shorts dont fit me like they did the first time and ive only worn them twice the material isnt what is use to be it stretches out to fast i dont think i will be buying these again wish i could take them back,0
4965,I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me it was very wide bust down and made me look lbs heavier im and lbs ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say its tts up top,0
4966,I did not have the same experience as the other reviewers found the color just as pictured a dusty pink made to look worn so may not be your thing fabric hangs nicely and is slimming on me long enough for leggings but great with jeans booties and long necklace needs accessorizing the aged look may not be for all but overall i love it,1
4967,Im and bought the small i buy most retailer tops in xs but the small fit well not too tight and is flattering the colors are as seen and are a soft muted color the material is thin which is fine for hot weather and i havent washed so cant say how colors will hold and how well material will hold but have high expectations for retailer apparel this will work well to wear with shorts or a navy maxi skirt adds a nice touch of color for spring and summer,1
4968,I got this in the red it is a muted color that is very pretty i am and it is neither too long nor too short it is a nice light weight the quality is good and on par with other purchases from this brand,1
4969,This dress is adorable thanks to everyone who commented that the dress runs small as thats definitely true i ended up ordering up two sizes and got a perfect fit i was afraid the wrapped skirt might emphasize the hips too much but that isnt the case it adds a bit of quirky style and makes this different from the usual shirt dress its great with booties or chunky wedges,1
4970,I wanted to like this and even considered getting it altered but just decided to return it runs big and from the front it looks good but the back just looked like a big oversized stretched out tank it was so comfy on though and not sheer or revealing so if youre tall go for it,0
4971,This top is beautiful and unique but also i predict it will be high maintenance with the sleeves definitely have to be careful with the delicate sleeves,1
4972,This is every bit as lovely as shown the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks lace embellishments and covered buttons for me tts i bought the size b my normal size i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts i think its a wonderful rendition of a denim top this would work in any season of the year,1
4973,I got it in tangerine beautiful soft material very flattering and cute dress i am petite so i will have to do some alterations to make the top port shorter but other than that its a perfect dress,1
4974,I loved these online and am even more in love since receiving them in the mail the band on top is a great touch for these flowy pants im and they are still a little long but other than that they are perfect,1
4975,I bought this cardigan in grey its sturdy soft great layering sweater over a top or even under a heavier sweater the tail in back is long and unique the shape is flattering and for a lighter cardigan its more substantial than others out there the sleeves are long enough for my long arms which i love,1
4976,Purchased the petite size of these jeans and the length is perfect for my height the description doesnt mention what length the petite size is but i believe it to be inches the jean is cut small in the hips and snug in the thighs so consider going up a size if you are curvy great color and style i may be something but these jeans bring me back to my youth love them,1
4977,I finally pressed go on the orange dress during the weekend sale the dress is terrific i am a busty dd size and the m fits perfectly based on the reviews i had planned to take this to the tailor to take in the armholes but it is not necessary at all no bra showing in front or back i am and the shortest part of the hem is about above my knee there is no lining so i might add a short pullon slip depending on where i wear it but otherwise this is an easy dress to be w,1
4978,I was so excited to receive this dress it even has embroidered loops on the hem of the slip underneath which was such a cute detail its very pretty on that being said i ordered a size which fit me perfectly lbs but ladies i do not mean this in any way but in my personal opinion my arms are out of shape not toned and flabby the sleeves on this dress will not do you any justice it will make your arms look worse because of the shape of the sleeve so keep that in consideration if,1
4979,Great boyfriend style jeans run large though i had to order a size down,1
4980,I am not sure why this is listed on the website at hd in paris because i purchased this shirt in carmel ca and it is actually maeve which is a brand i buy often and always fits me well this piece did not disappoint this is a fun and versatile black top but has a little edge with its design and i know that i will get a lot of use out of it i dont find the fabric to be rough at all but it is textured which i just think adds to the interest of this piece i am a d and did not find my c,1
4981,This is a lovely jacket i thought it was going to be thicker but its so classy and chic i got several comments on it and ive only worn it once great jacket to have in my closet i can wear it to work to dress up an outfit for school or to complete an outfit,1
4982,I am so glad i got these pants the quality is great and the fit is perfect they are very flattering and comfortable i have worn them with flip flops on a casual day and have also worn them with black heels for a date night worth the purchase,1
4983,I fell in love with this tunic on instagram and couldnt wait to find it during the tops promotion it was absolutely not a disappointment as the other reviewer mentioned the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images and this actually makes the shirt more beautifultheyre rich and fallish but not at all over the topim thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a rangei di,1
4984,These are more than what i had expected theyre beautiful and fit like a glove im thrilled that i purchased them,1
4985,This is a very slimming wellmade nice fitting topi just disliked the colors they did not look good on me otherwise this is a very nice piece,0
4986,A great addition to any wardrobe can go with nice trousers and dressier shoes for work or jeans and trainers for a casual look i didnt find it to run small and indeed thought it fit as id expect,1
4987,I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didnt deter my liking it because its still a lovely shade of pink the fabric takes a bit getting used to though i thought it would be silkier but its really a thicker fabric i ordered a size small and i usually wear size the dress drowned me so i returned it for an xs which fit me beautifully so,1
4988,I see that many of you like myself fell in love with the look and feel of this sweater and reluctantly bought it even though it sheds like crazy i just wanted to let you all in on a little trick to stop the shedding it will sound strange but it worked like a charm fold up the sweater seal it in a ziploc bag and pop it in the freezer for hours bam it will shed no more now i can completely love this sweater,1

4991,This dress looks great on me it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and its easy and comfortable to wear,1
4992,This top is so pretty i would say its probably about size smaller than normal but i like the cropped fit,1
4993,I accidentally found this gem at my store today i adore layering my style and this is a perfect edition its light but has enough weight to it that it has some movement and doesnt stick to other fabric i wouldnt quite call it gauze since its heavier than your typical gauze its super long im and it definitely went to my knees when worn buttoned up its clean and classic when worn open its cool bohemian and edgywhile still looking totally put together i adore this wish,1
4994,These colors my cup of tea i love everything about this top from the fit to the raw edge of the neck trim it does seem like it will wrinkle easily but i can manage that for its sheer beauty,1
4995,I love this it is perfect it is sheer but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great so glad antro finally has something with a waist the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one,1
4996,This dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about inches above my knee and i am i will wear this with tights for work color is very nice also,1
4997,I always love the arielle jeans every color seems to be slightly different in the fit but they are always slim enough in the leg and thigh to be stylish without being too restricting to echo the other reviews the pockets are a little low on these compared to other arielle cut jeans that i already own i have a fairly straight athletic shaped body and went with my larger size to wear them as more of a boyfriend fit the fabric is a very soft and forgiving denim and the dark color can be dr,1
4998,Bring back the old retailer timeless pieces this cardigan is very flattering the flutter sleeves add a romantic touch to the cardigan the colors are neutral and the vine part black is like velvety the fit is super flattering i originally bought hte xs in the store but decided to also order the xs petite to compare i am lbs and dd with waist both fit but the petite was better fitted on my waist also the length would work better on top of dresses i also tried,1
4999,I had high hopes for this tunic for an upcoming ny trip to look stylish and beat the heat it is huge the tunic swallowed my whole it came down nearly to my knees im and it was gigantic shapeless and did not look stylish at all on the model it looks like it hits midthigh i am a size and the l was like a giant trash bag on me if i had time i would try the medium,0

5012,I ordered the taupe version of this tee which was a medium brown with black stripes the fabric felt itchy and rough and was pretty sheer for not being light colored i didnt care for the fit which was extremely boxy and wide from the picture i expected an aline fit but not a wide drop with webbed underarms i ordered sizes and could have worn the smaller if id kept this tee it runs on the larger side what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro,0

5018,Love these pants bought both the navy and the white they are comfortable and a perfect fit the xs is just right im normally a in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right soft and silky they fall in a lovely way,1

5030,Love this dress im lbs and typically wear either a small or xsmall in maeve since this one has lots of extra fabric i ordered it in an xs and xxs they were basically the same everywhere except the xxs had a much shorter weave pattern at the top so i ended up keeping the xs its great dress lots of room and swings nicely,1

5037,I love these jeans i wear them all the time i love the way they fit and the price is great please make these exact pants in more colors,1
5038,The fabric is soooo thick the pattern is very springsummer but the heavy thick and lined fabric says otherwise the pockets are great and the fit was true to size but that fabric killed it for me,0
5039,I bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks its really stunning the red is incredibly vibrant especially for linen and the construction is very highquality since its linen it feels crisp and light and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flatout hot days the rayon slip is a really nice touch too since the linen is fairly transparent it really drove home the sense of quality for me i bought mine in size regular which i found slightly big i,1

5048,Good quality fabric and structure but the mix media details and lines make them seem more like jodphurs than leggings its hard to see where i would wear them sorry but they have to go back,0
5049,This is the softest jacket i could sleep in this fabric the ruched details and fun collar make it unique plus it has inside pockets one of the best finds in a while,1
5050,These tanks are very soft i have two black and one coral i had to return the white as it was see through they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if youre in between sizes i recommend these tanks for sure,1
5051,Ill start by saying the fabric and concept are beautiful the top is sheer but thats pretty clear in the images and not surprising for a lightweight white blouse the problem is that the arms are more fitted and the torso not the chest but the midsection is cut fairly wide im b and usually wear a or a smallmedium depending on how relaxed i want the fit i purchased this in a the arms were workable but slightly fitted and the torso fit like an chest was as expect,0
5052,This top is very wide and shorter than in appears in the picture it also has a strong chemical smell ive had a couple pieces with that smell in the past and the smell never washed out,0
5053,This jacket is the best definitely my staple jacket for the spring it is so comfortable and soft i usually wear a small in retailer clothing but i opted for the medium in this so theres a little room for layering even with the extra room it is so flattering i absolutely love this jacket,1
5054,I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually i will say that i have to often keep adjustingpulling the top neckline down it seems to want to revert to abovetheshoulders position the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me,1
5055,I love this dress perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves,1
5056,This vest is super cute im and usually wear an xs at retailer i have this in a small and it fits perfectly fits snug when zipped my usual xs would have definitely been too tight would definitely recommend,1
5057,Well made lined great find for the fall,1
5058,This blouse is very beautiful and flattering its just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so,1
5059,I love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out the lining is like clouds on your calves theyre thick enough that you dont need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they dont add bulk love love them,1
5060,Super comfortablegreat layering piece or by itselfgot lots of compliments at work,1
5061,I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress friends strangers younger older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress it has a s vibe to it fun and swingy perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler i think it will look great with leggings and boots i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite im and and it hit just above my knee my favorite dress right now,1
5062,This dress is great for hiding any insecurities its also very comfy,1
5063,This top is semi fitted and then stretches as you wear it i love the design and color choices,1
5064,The length on these are great they stretch but so far they dont stretch out the material is a dark and soft i am and lbs the size fit great,1
5065,This dress is absolutely beautiful i wear with with a flat shoes gold i got a lot of complaints i was witing the fall season finale antro bringing what i want,1
5066,Love this vest its so chic and pairs with so much i have it in the army green and its prefect to wear over a romper or white jeans and top its great i am about and an typically a small top the small was much to big but the xs was perfect i would consider trying to size down if you are uncertain i am very happy with my purchase,1
5067,This top is lovely exquisite embroidery in a silverybeige color compliments the deep plum the fit is close to highlight your curves while being just a touch comfy very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties i wear a size normally and the medium fits me perfectly my body type is curvy and athletic,1
5068,The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates indeed though the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and bootsi like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirtlove it will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate too the sale price was a huge bonus,1
5069,I cant believe these arent sold out yet i had no problem getting this over my head this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery quality is good flattering on at this price it is probably the best deal ive gotten on anything from retailer i would recommend this top absolutely,1
5070,Very old color and item a little full but comfortable,1
5071,I love the ruching on this hoodie which is why i ordered it im typically a size small b lbs but the hoodie was a bit tight in the waist and around the bottom band i might order it in a medium although the sleeves will likely be too long the only thing that makes me hesitate is the color its more of a brown gray instead of just gray as you see on your computer screen,1
5072,Cute skirt i bought it to go with boots tall and short and looks great if you pair it with the right top it reminds me of the funky eclectic retailer look that this retailer is famous for i usually wear a size or and i went with the because it didnt hang so low but thats just me,1
5073,I love how pretty and soft this shirt is it falls well i want to wear it everyday,1
5074,Really fantastic shirt ordered multiple colors and will keep them all the gray especially looks a bit boring online but is gorgeous in real life it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty neckline is interesting wish the front was a tad shorter im but dont think petite will work really really great shirt,1
5075,I get compliments on this top every single time i wear it the pattern is so pretty and while its very lightweight it still drapes nicely i would caution that someone with a larger chest may find that the shape is not quite right i am a d and just on the cusp of having it be too balloony on top,1
5076,I bought this in size xl it is so much bigger than i expected there are panels of material it really is huge not flattering at all still i kept it the material is so soft flowy ive gotten good use wearing it around the house doing chores resting etc i wouldnt wear it out doing errands but around home its perfect for feeling cozy such a strange cut i dont know who would look good in it since it can look sloppy i think many would enjoy wearing it at home,0
5077,This is a very pretty top with nice lace details the linen makes it not quite as soft as cotton but still comfortable and breathable the fit was just right in the small petite i tried it on in the store and was very tempted but wound up not buying it because i have other similar tops i would snap it up if it went on sale or if i needed a top of this type,1
5078,Slouchy longer in the sleeves a little cropped great neckline stylishthese are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater ive been looking for a style like this for a long time i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized im petite lbs with a f bust size i went with the grey but im loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink so comfy and cozy and chic,1
5079,Ive had this jacket for a few weeks and it has been a terrific transition piece for the spring this is a lightweight layering piece without any lining it works well as a topper for cooler morning temps and you can still wear it later in the day without perspiring through it i bought it in the olive color which works with just about everything and the xs was tts for reference lbs the fit is slightly boxy with a nice swing and drape in the back for those concerned about the back,1
5080,Beautiful color design and fit but i couldnt wait to get it off i dont have sensitive skin and dont recall ever putting a jacket on that felt like steel wool,0
5081,I am very happy with this ponchosweater it is my first cashmere sweater and it feels so soft and luxurious true it does not have full length sleeves but if you adjust the sweater so that it comes down lower on your shoulders it will come well past your elbows covering most of your arms i feel very elegant wearing it looks great with skinny pants or leggings and boots would recommend,1
5082,Great wardrobe staple at i ordered the s and the fit was great you can wear this so many ways and its soft,1
5083,This is one of the best tops ive ordered it fits well it can be worn dressy or casual what is pictured is what you get if you are considering this top it can be worn all year round the price is not outrageous and the quality seems it could last for more than one season,1
5084,Runs a bit small very slimming love these when will they be available in moss again,1
5085,This piece is a great easy throw on that allows you to still look polished its heavy weight is a perfect substitute for a coat on those inbetween fall weather days when you dont want to lug a jacket around lining is super soft and makes it so comfortable to wear,1
5086,I was able to purchase this on sale and im so glad i did i usually go between a size s and m lbs d but the small fits perfectly the color really isnt dark orange as statedkind of a cross between rosepale red salmon but i really love the color its not super heavy weight but not really thin eitheractually perfect,1
5087,This skirt caught my eyes right away in the clearance section i would have tried size but it wasnt available however size fitted just fine the print has bright summery feel to it the lines on skirt are more carrot orange than it is to red fabric is soft,1
5088,When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned i got the black w the white collarcuffs i thought it was terribly itchy material which could be remedied w a shirt underneath but the white collar part was such a dull ugly whitedirty color maybe the other colors are better,0
5089,I am short on the heavy side lbs i always wear large petite this beautiful blouse swallows me lots of fabric on the front side of the shirt causing a boxy look i could totally do a mp if not sp i am going to try and exchangebeautiful blouse great quality breathable fabric colors are deep and rich so comfy highly recommend,1
5090,Theyre the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year easy purchase,1
5091,These are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color sadly using free and clear detergent on a cold delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy and they are unwearable this happened once and i exchanged for another pair but ill be returning this pair ill be sad to see my favorite color go but there is obviously a defect in the dye used maybe ill try another color,0
5092,I bought these pants for a planned trip to southeast asia where i want to look put together but also be very comfortable the lightweight fabric is perfect for traveling in warm climates where one shouldnt necessarily be wearing shorts in certain public places or when visiting religious sites these pants can also go to the pool out on errands and to brunch i bought the navy and would considering also buying the beige great find and very reasonable sale price,1
5093,If youre a little afraid to rock a jumpsuit this ones for you the palazzo leg makes it look a lot like a dress a light shelf bra was very supportive even for my ddd cup it does run large im typically a and was easily able to fit in the although the look it a bit racier on me due to cleavage hides any tummy you might have very well due to the flowing cut the fabric is light and comfortable my only complaint is i wish it was a tad longer i can not wait to rock this at a weddi,1
5094,The photo of the mila turtleneck where model has her hands to her sides and just below her hair there is a bit of extra fabric which falls to the bottom of the sweater in a bit of a pleat well its not representative of the abundance of fabric in the xl i usually wear an l or xl well with retailer clothing the excess added the appearance of excessive pounds from breasts to bottom of sweater bummer ill be returning it,0
5095,I fell in love with this in the store i am petite at and lbs and i went with the regular size i agree with another reviewer that the petite sizing would have been too short the color is rich the quality is fabulous and i love the style it is not fitted but i also found that it wasnt too wide either if youre looking for a fitted top this wouldnt be the one but if you love a wellstyled top with a bit of volume that you can rock with a pair of skinnies to balance it out the,1
5096,Im and pounds with short legs and got a large petite it fits really well a tiny bit too short but could just be my proportions and the quality seems very high definitely can be dressed up or down good for a business casual work environment,1
5097,I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchasers deodorant and perfume it was actually nauseating to put on i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress full price in this condition otherwise the dress is lovely it is true to size i am lbs and the size was perfect,1
5098,I love this long knit skirt it is great for any of the cooler seasons it has a lovely somewhat aline look when you have it on the knit is a light weight but has a nice feel to it true to size i love the length to pair with tall boots,1
5099,Love this shawlwrap was looking to purchase the white warren cashmere poncho but available online only and then saw this in the store tried it on and fell in love love that its cashmere super soft and warm would recommend,1
5100,This dress can be flattering on any figure type but especially for women who need a little curve i always wear a in hd and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra it may not be a great cut for a short person as it has a long line to it and lots of busyness only drawback which depends on your taste is the yellow pattern its a weird kind of greeny yellow,1
5101,Rarely do i find tops that fit similar to the model in the picture my body type is no comparison i am and about with waist this sweater in a large fit perfectly where the back lining and ruffle fell right at the top of my bottom which was very flattering not to short and not long over bottom just right bought in cream and wish i would have bought in both colors,1
5102,This shirt totally exceeded my expectations the detail and colors are wonderful and the shirt itself is quite comfortable the shirt is a bit boxy but there is enough structure and detail so that it looks quite flattering on plus it looks great with jeans or with a skirt it is very easy to style,1
5103,These coveralls are not cut long enough i am long in the body and it is very hard for me to find coveralls overalls that are long enough and these unfortunately are the same i have large breast so that adds to the problem so when i stand sideways and look at the waistband the front you can see is pulled up where the back is hanging lower they really are nice my first thought when i put them kn was wow i look a tad like michael myers in them but theyre really very coolwish i could keep,1
5104,I love this dress perfect with high boots and the quality of fabric looks and feels great fits just like it shows in the picturei am size and i ordered the medium and its flows well on me i like it a little looser for that boho look,1
5105,I love the soft slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket dont expect a crisp fit im not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer the onebutton closure is easy to wear the hem curves for a more feminine look i hesitated before ordering hoping it would turn up at my local retailer by the time i was ready to order the green version had sold out as it turns out the copper is even better it was degrees today but i wore it anyway,1
5106,Im about lbs overweight and the material clings a bit this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape,1
5107,The dress didnt meet my expectations specifically the color the texture and the cut of the dress although the dress was very well made it just wasnt right for me,0
5108,The picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color it looks great on and the colors compliment each other i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe,1
5109,The black and white photo of this sweater makes it look absolutely beautiful the color photography looked to be a beautiful rich burnt red color it simply did not match it was more of an almost faded version of the rich color the fit was ok just didnt love it,0
5110,I bought this in purple and then just now in navyi love the sleeve length and neckline this shirt is made of a very soft knit material a so its very comfy and flattering goes well with jeans shirts and shorts i definitely recommend purchasing this shirt,1
5111,I recommend this product but with the following reservations the dye from the product colors my skin every time i wear this outfit i love the fit and make of the jumper but i hate that my skin looks blue by the end of the day this is still happening after several washes which makes me feel disappointed it will dye your undergarments so choose wisely,0
5112,I bought this top in my usual size in a small im a d waist i absolutely love it i pair it with a red cardigan very cute,1
5113,Love the pilcro brand they are one of my favorites even compared to other more expensive denim brands i ordered my usual two sizes smaller and found they did not fit this time i probably should have ordered one size smaller than my usual in this cut sadly i have to send these beauties back and hope for a popback,1
5114,I found this top in the roc center store and knew i had to have it when my usual size was unavailable i sized down to a because it looked plenty big and it fits fine i bought the ivory color and love it i plan on wearing it with pants as well as skirts its a lovely shade of ivory quite flattering boxy tops are often not for me but this one is perfect,1
5115,This top is the epitome of late summer and getting into fall mood its soft fabric falls nicely on top of skinny jeans the open shoulders are trendy and flattering,1
5116,I bought the white in my usual xs size i dont agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin because it is not a sweater it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric not a sweater knit very cute with a flattering fit casual wear,1
5117,This tunic is amazing im not usually one for turtlenecks but its not too tight around the neck and very comfortable i love the versatility it can be worn with pantsleggings or a skirt you can layer it with a shirt or blouse underneath or throw a jacket over it,1
5118,Love this top very feminine and looks cute with heels and jeans or can be worn more casually too,1
5119,Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans however i purchased them at off on retailer day andhonestlythey look so good i probably would have paid full price these jeans are fresh,1
5120,This suit is perfect in every way the leg opening could be a little bigger for the size i would be a small if the leg openings were a bit biggerplease please offer another suit before december so i can buy for our cruise,1
5121,Ok so by now we know this is a cute top that is basically true to size but a little clingy i prefer to wear it with a tank top or tee shirt underneath it would also do well layered under something for refernce i am about and xs was the best fitbut what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low and it survived just fine,1
5122,Beautiful dress perfect for work the museum a summer picnicso chic yet extremely comfortable i purchased the blueorange combo and the colors definitely pop for reference i am and i went with the xs petite especially reoommend for anyone with her hourglass being more full on bottom super flattering,1
5123,This is festival dress epitomized flowery flowy romantic styling so many layers in a muted color pattern but also retains heat since its all polyester good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out my distress is regarding the length petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges its still too long if i hem i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern,1
5124,Ive been wanting to buy a romper that was easy to wear and take off and i like this one for many reasons the elastic waist holds the romper in place when you take the top off the top comes off easily bc its a halter and the design is very chic and sophisticated the only down side is the tie is really heavy if you tie it in the back its better to tie it in the front like the model in this picture it is a bit long comes down to my ankles but looks good with heels,1
5125,Its exactly how it appears in the picturesawesome shirt,1
5126,These pants are gorgeous when you first see them they fit beautifully when you first put them on and then you wear them for one day and they snag on everything and little strings start to come out of the pants and the hem begins to unravel and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them after one day i cant begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent,0
5127,I absolutley love this sweater is is very cozy and warm and can be paired with many different outfits i am upset i didnt get one in every color,1
5128,This top is so lovely the fabric is thick and soft and the drape is phenomenal i did size down based on reviews i typically wear a large and the medium is perfect nice and flowy and very flattering,1
5129,I cant believe that im the first person to write a review this top is so cute i tried it on in a store and loved it the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in the color and print are pretty the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami,1
5130,I love this sweater i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesnt look like a sack on me plus it is the perfect weight i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable,1
5131,Im obsessed with this top i got it for christmas and wore it to dinner with black pants and flats and got lots of compliments the fit is cute and fun and the detail is about even prettier in person,1
5132,I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown tneck and straight leg pants i get a lot of compliments on it i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick the color is true to what is shown the fit is perfect and what i expected i highly recommend the purchase,1
5133,I love this skirt im trying to find the perfect place to wear it,1
5134,I love this tee i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered of the prints wish that the purplegray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes so i hang it up to dry after machine washing i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium,1
5135,Got this shirt in the green color its long and flowy and fits true to size super comfy,1
5136,I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it i am lbs b and ordered a petite fits like a glove the dress has a slight give to it but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size fits close through the waist and flares out below the length hit above the knee so not too short although i wouldnt want it any shorter my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back but i had no issue overall the dress is stunning with,1
5137,I love this shirt it is great quality and hangs perfectly please make more colors in this one i would buy all of them,1
5138,I bought this in the neutral motif and its exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life the colors are ivory with dusty pink and bluegray puffs of color the fabric is incredibly soft i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and im glad i did if you like things really fitted i guess you could order your normal size but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath i went with the medium this ziphoodie is great quality and it look,1
5139,Cute and comfortable i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is,1
5140,This is a great layering piece took it on a trip and wore with both a long sleeve and tank under it is more khaki color then the photo shows which was a goo thing for me,1
5141,The sherpa vest i received from retailer was the color the model is wearing the same hue and shade of both the faux shearliing and faux leather im very satisfied with the vest i believe it runs a bit large i usually wear a large sometimes an extra large yet the ml fit me fine shearling is very in this year and this will complete your lookwearing either pants or skirts,1
5142,I really love the fit of this classic scoop neck tee i am lbs and ab i am typically a size xss or in all retailer tops however this brand velvet runs small i had to order a size medium the fit is slim to your body and is a little sexy with the low scoop neck the fabric is very soft and a little thin i am a little concerned how it is going to wash it seems a little delicate but i will wash it on the delicate cycle and line dry it i ordered the black classic,1
5143,This is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned and i am kind of a dress person this one has beautiful detailing sheer sleeves but the bodice and bottom half are lined fits beautifully i am a little busty so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress i am and the length was just right abou,1
5144,I love this little chemise the adjustable straps sold me because im petite i generally wear a smallp im about lbs i purchased a small and it fit perfect the fabric is nice not too thin or too thick i would totally wear it just as easily as a nightgown or beach coverup ive never been able to wear scrappy dresses but it could probably pass for one of those too its flattering and pretty without being too pretty if you get my meaning,1
5145,I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty great combo has a shabby chic feel the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body not fitted which i like,1
5146,Beautiful top had trouble with the buttons but i just slipped it over my head to avoid trying to get the buttons loose it will look great with dark jeans and mules,1
5147,I love this top i am always looking for tops that are comfortable and work as basics the material is super soft and not too clingy it feels like pajamas but looks very polished i am a little wide in the stomach and bust but this didnt look boxy i got these in all colors,1
5148,The tshirt is comfy and has a little curve on the tail which is fun,1
5149,I wanted a comfortable and loose casual dress i liked the pictures and decided to give it a trythe dress turned out to be too loose i got size after checking the measurements chart im lb and usually wear s i could practically wrap myself in this dress besides it looks a bit too long well im not as tall as the model in the photos and i dont like wearing high heelsthe material looks faded not as bright as in the pictures i like distressed and vintage style but this,0
5150,Size up this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it,1
5151,Cute cool dress for hot summer days very roomy has pockets,1
5152,This sweater is gorgeous the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it the bell sleeves are a nice change i have very long arms and they fit perfectly i could wear this sweater out,1
5153,This looks so cutebut dont be fooled it is so poofy it does not look in real life like it does on the model it poofs way out on the sides and looks ridiculous i was so disappointed,0
5154,I love everything by cloth stone so was excited to see that they made a dress hooray i ordered it in the xl which is my usual size in their shirts when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips i am a true size and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move my chest also caused the dreaded button gape it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure so disappointing,0
5155,I am lbs the small fit well in the bust but no shape it was just big and frumpy it went back,0
5156,This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it also it is pretty lightweight so it stays cool,1
5157,I love this sweater im very sensitive to fabrics and this really doesnt bother me too much its soft but just a tiny bit scratchy but the color is a rich purple and the flexibility of being able to wear it draped or not is a nice touch it comes right at waist lengthlittle on the short side if you want to hide your muffin top but otherwise a winner all around,1
5158,Love it although i had to purchase it in sizes before finding the right one it does run large i normally take a l or el but a medium in this had the perfect drape i am and lbs and it is very flattering a perfect piece to be worn as a dress or as a tunic over skinny pants can be as sophisticated or casual as you choose to make it with accessories,1
5159,Id been eyeing this dress for a while wondering if it could work for me i wound up ordering the sp size when it went on sale its pretty perfecti am and currently lbs it fits well if a touch loose in the waist but i think if i had purchased the xsp it might be too snug through the bust as its fairly fitted there the neckline comes a little lower than i usually wear which is part of why i wanted to order the petite size rather than the regular that and the length but i can,1
5160,There were no reviews its an online exclusive and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material on the white version of this it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful as a busty d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph im an anth,0
5161,Purchased this today at my local retailerbeen eyeing it a whilethinking i would wait until on saleuntil the salesgirl whom i know said it was their second shipment and all have sold out knew i needed to splurge i tried on the small and x small and wound up going for the small i did however try on smalls and two of them were way to roomy but the third one fit like a charmit was quite a bit slimmer in body than the two smalls strange but true i do have room in iti am a c to b and,1
5162,This top is large like with free people i got an extra small and washed it right away and put it in the dryer and it is soft and perfect so comfortable and will be a go to top with jeans pj bottoms or leggings i love the pocket and my cell phone fits perfectly i am now ordering the other color for reference i am and pounds,1
5163,Oh my goodness i just received this coat tonight i love it it is beautiful and stylish i got the green which is amazing im weigh ordered both s and xs im keeping the s more room in case a heavier sweater get this its a classic you will smile,1
5164,I tried this dress on in the store and loved it its unfortunately out my price range but if i could have afforded it i would have bought it im about and the length of the size was perfect sexy back and great color,1
5165,I bought these in light grey and navy they are both beautiful high qualityvery flattering and so comfortable i love them theyre a perfect long length i have long legs and it can be challenging finding a good length in pants the pockets are deep and functional which is rare in womens pants they are more than i like to spend but i will get a lot of wear out of them they look and feel fantastic i highly recommend these,1
5166,Adorable great for yoga or everyday use can even fit a strapless bra under with no showingi purchased the black im usually a and it fit great,1
5167,This is the most beautiful dress ive ever owned the detail is exquisite i never write reviews and felt i had to for this dress i love itthe embroidery does catch on the beading so you have to handle it carefully its worth the special treatment though,1
5168,I saw this and the giddy up tees at the store and it was so difficult to decide because they have their own uniqueness unlike the giddy up tee this tee has no embroidery but saying it has just patterns is underestimating it the pattern is a work of art it has cowboys ranch scenery cacti and the earthly colors are gorgeous for all seasons especially for those who still have a leftover summer tan the hem of the tee is a bit round which i thought is unique and versatile for tucking in,1
5169,I just received this dress and i love it after reading the reviews i was worried that it would be too tight so i ordered both a and an i am hourglass lbs and the is just perfect i love how it falls just below the knee but the front slit gives it that little flirt factor this is the goto summer dress i had been looking for,1
5170,These feel well made and so soft but for me they were just too low and too baggyall i did was pull them up and feel uncomfortable i wanted them to work maybe in a smaller size they would feel better i ordered my normal in the light pink they were very cute i think i just have a hard time with pants with a rise this low,1
5171,Very cute and flattering very fitting in legs and thighs and i have fairly slim legs i am a size and was very snug i recommend trying these on in store or trying several sizes to see best fit,1
5172,This jacket is so pretty and fits amazing i ordered the size small and it fits as expected i normally wear a size small and a size,1
5173,Love this tee its stylish and comfy i ordered the white and its a thicker fabric so i dont have to wear a camisole underneath i want to order more colors it does slightly big,1
5174,Loved the one i had in white so much i ordered the green such a beautiful piece size seems true to size and it elevates anything you wear it with skirt jeans shortsif you are on the fence jump you wont be disappointed,1
5175,These pants are very soft and comfortable great for lounging around the house and for sleeping,1
5176,I love this cardigan its quite luxurious and roomy and long in the front leaving lots to wrap around yourself the back is more croppedand slim fitting to help balance this is so soft and warm i love it definitely bulky and cozy not fitted but perfect for a casual look im usually a medium in sweaters but got a small in this and its still a little loose which is perfect,1
5177,Loved how this top looked online and couldnt wait to get it i ordered the xs and it was huge and also very short in length compared to the picture online i love the fabric and design but the fit was totally off this is going back,0
5178,Let me preface this by saying im totally keeping this dressit is kind of a weird design but intriguing i received it in the mail yesterday i am lbs and have hips as a previous reviewer mentioned this dress is more fitted than a swing dress as it appears fortunately the xs fit me just right but i cannot gain another lbmy husband said that i looked like i was in a choir because of the higher neck design and bell sleeves but he too found the dress somewhat alluring,1
5179,Love this cozy sweater for layering i purchased the green have the cream saved in my cart and also love the coral and blue too lbs c ordered size small which was perfect,1
5180,The weight and drape of this shirt is wonderful it is very comfortable while still being flattering you could wear it with jeans and sneakers or heels fits true to size and the navy color is very deep,1
5181,Soft fabric waistband is flat no vpllace trim cuts in a bit for a little vpl but still nice lightweight barely there but full coverage would buy again,1
5182,Couldnt resist the polka dots very cute and stylish cardi since im short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me i tried on the xs and small and while there wasnt a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room its pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase,1
5183,Color orangered and fabric nice and good qualityi ordered this since i live in astoria but am glad i did,1
5184,I really liked this cardigan it is well made and very pretty i will wear it when it gets a little cooler in early fall because i tried to wear it on one of these really hot days and it felt little too warm,1

5186,I absolutely love these shorts i ordered a medium i was nervous they would be too small my legs arent the skinniest but because of the slit on the side they were fine i do have a pretty tiny waist and they were slightly snug but not too much to send them back i am almost and weight i have a solid black one piece suit and they look great with it i love the material as well they are extremely comfortable a little pricey but i will definitely make use of them i love the pr,1
5187,Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price but is is really cute the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up it is a good color and feels very nice i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front for reference i am and,1
5188,I purchased this in black as in the other reviews the lace detail is a little snug in the arms but it did stretch i did not have a problem with any fraying or quality issues the shape is very flattering ive been asked where i bought this several times,1

5190,I love this tee so much i bought in every color available i have received so many compliments on each one so soft and comfortable and easy care,1
5191,The color of the sweater is beautiful but the fit was awful it was too swingy and made me look like i gained lbs instantly im lbs i will be unfortunately returning this item,0
5192,This skirt is stunning like the other reviewer i believe this is probably the most beautiful thing in my closet the colors are just striking it is also flattering i find some skirts can kind of pouf out around the hips and add bulk this one lays nice and flat and looks great the material is very soft and simple and i love the frayed edges at the bottom i am just between and and weigh lbs i took an xs and it fits perfectly so it seems true to size only thing if you are,1
5193,I love these im between a and and as the s were sold out i had to go with the s they fit well as expected very nice fabric good design have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice,1

5195,I absolutely love this dress the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape its great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south but i can put tights with it when it gets colder the dress is thin but not sheer so theres no need for a liner im weigh lbs and ordered this dress in a size i think i might have been able to wear an but the fit so well that i kept it,1

5198,I purchased this dress while vacationing in florida and cannot wait for the midwest weather to warm up so i can wear it i am tall and love how this dress fits me i found the slip to work well with the dress and that it was not too sheer the length was perfect not too short in the front and just enough drape in the back i love that the slip is attached so it lines up perfectly,1
5199,According to the label this dress can be hand washed or dry cleaned i hand washed and line dried per the instructions on the label and all the seams have completely shrunk and gathered it looks like theres a drawstring running through every seam so disappointed in the quality and the labeling awful i gave it one extra star because its cute,0

5206,I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online its pricey but i am holding on to it because its really beautiful i got a medium im medium built its just perfect im tempted to get the petite but with petite the top gets to be too short so i think ill stick with regular size my family loved it the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous you can easily dress this up or down,1
5207,Ive ordered a pair of these from the catalog and loved them on my next visit to a store i picked up another color im now considering getting another pair while the free shipping deal is going on they are great pants with a great fit,1
5208,Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down super comfortable and flattering i ordered the xs and it fit perfect,1
5209,I ordered these pants in my usual size xl and was shocked when i received them the waist was huge and there was nothing in the way of an elastic or tie to keep them up i couldnt keep them on so of course back they go too bad the sweater quality is great,0
5210,Cool cut and texture a winner,1
5211,I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on i got the smallim in between xs and s b and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut i bought the green and did not find it sheer i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days i found the arm holes were fine i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time planning on getting a couple of more colors,1
5212,This is great and very soft inside i am wearing it around my house all the time great over workout clothes or jeans and leggings,1

5214,I love this dress i got it in the blue and i feel like everything about it is so modern and class and summery it runs a bit on the small side im between a and an i went with the six but its definitely tight i have a larger chest and its pretty low and sexy though you could knot the laces at the top for a more modest neckline ive also put shirts under it and its a super cute jumper im and the dress regular not petite hits right below my knee,1
5215,Great tunic i get compliments every time i wear it,1
5216,This product fit well and was soft and beautifully made,1
5217,Love this cost runs large usually wear a medium or large ordered a medium and had to exchange it for a small fits perfect now not very heavy so dont buy if youre looking for a warm coat,1
5218,Im so disappointed this dress didnt work out i ordered the size medium post baby im a solid dress size or depending on the designerthe cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up also the length was super long description says which would be mid thigh for me but this thing hit me mid knee also like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress but the shoulders def,0
5219,Fits great and i love the length very cute skirt,1
5220,This dress looked super cute in the picture and on the model i ordered the petite style and it was still so big and way too loose no shape whatsoever i unfortunately had to return it i love loose dresses but this one was way too big loose and had no shape at all,0
5221,I love this sweater the wool is soft and not itchy it can be worn tied in the front as shown or tied in the back pretty embrodering and very flattering,1

5223,These shirts are fantastic lightweight sleeves for summer wear i go back and forth between xs and small i have broad shoulders and ordered one of each i like both the shirt has give so the xs is fine but the variation in size gives the two shirts very different looksthe color is fantastic and true to the photos not always the case with online purchasing so i loved that,1
5224,Great skirt easy to wear perfect weight for springfall very comfortable while still looking stylish the xs fit well,1
5225,This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear but do not wash it the hem completely fell apart for me,0
5226,When i saw this dress online it was a must have i preordered immediately and had my fingers crossed that id get it thankfully it did this dress has blown me away it exceeds all expectations i ordered an xl which is a normal size for me and im glad i did the body is very swingy but the top is true to size the print is magical whimsical bold bohemian and transitional into every single season i am and the dress hits just above my knees i feel gorgeous in it the woven cotton,1
5227,I ordered these a size up because id just had a baby and knew i needed a bigger size my prepre baby size chubby phase were size these fit like a size way too small very disappointed,0
5228,This jacket looked adorable on it was also quite comfortable however it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched sadly this is a deal breaker for me,0
5229,I love this top looks great with just about any kind of jean skinny flare especially high waisted even looks good with vests and cardigans a perfect versatile piece for the fall you wont regret,1
5230,I found the material a little stiff im asummig linen is stiff at first i got an xxs and fit tts in my case b lb,1
5231,This dress had my attention immediately online but in person it was even prettier i would not say the colors are very pink as the color selection indicates rather browns with possible pink undertones and yellows and even a splash of dark green in the print here and there there isnt a ton of give or stretch to the fabric so a larger chest may need to size up i am lbs c curvymuscular frame and the size fit just right though i dont have a ton of extra room in the chest,1
5232,I washed this on the delicate cycle and air dried very happy to report that it washed very well and still looks new,1
5233,At first i didnt like the way this skirt hung the fabric seemed stiff and it stuck out at the sides where the straight front seam meets the dipped back but i ran it through a wash and dry and it softened up and hangs much better you have to love a polished looking skirt that you can launder with all your other clothes i am also very pleased that although it looks bulky in the pictures here it isnt at all and it doesnt wrinkle perfect for traveling light note also that the front pl,1
5234,I got this dress and the material was super fuzzy and itchy the prior reviews stated it was warm and cozy and not itchy at all but i found it to be uncomfortably so the dress was true to size for me and the length was good i loved the plaid in the material just wished the material had been more soft and not rough the material reminded me of mohair,0
5235,I was able to grab two of these in grey and navy during one of their awesome sales it doesnt look like much on the hanger but its lovely on the bodypros lots of stretch comfortable and roomy without looking frumpy lovely color and texture can size up or down depending on how you want it to look minimizes bust size nicelycons if you have curves like me it wont be as roomy as the model unless you size up i actually bought a size down and it b,1
5236,I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed not the same colors as the picture spandex material the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress,0
5237,Love this its loose and easy for summer fabric is not too sheer the asymmetrical ruffle is such a cute feature washes well i got the pink for myself though its a deep coral color perfect for me and the gray for my daughter wish theyd had the powder blue when i bought ours id have bought that color for her instead,1
5238,I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous i really loved it until i put it on wow it was bad i ordered a smallnormally a smmed due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material it wasnt long but rather incredibly boxy one of the most unflattering things ive ever tried at retailer,0
5239,Looks great on fits beautifully,1
5240,This is a beautiful dress fits true to size very flowy and comfortable the color looks just like the pic,1
5241,I almost did not buy this dress because of the polyrayon construction but i saw some sweet styling on instagram that got me hooked the dress is silky soft and a bit oversized as i purchased the smallest of my size range looks very swingy and free spirited when worn loose cinch the string tie or add a wide belt for a defined waist and beautiful full skirt i have many outfits in mind for this perfect fall dress im excited to start wearing it my weight has been fluctuating so right now im,1
5242,I need one in every color so super soft,1
5243,Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size it runs a full size too small it sold out before and i was told it wasnt coming back in i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small to my delight its back and ive purchased one in the next size up its well made can go from business to sport to casual,1
5244,This is a cute item at a good price point though the lack of lining in cartonnier items drives me batty unfortunately the wool is so itchy i could not tolerate it more than a second,0
5245,I tried these on in in a in the store and they were a bit snug they graciously offered to look online and found the they arrived in less than a week and are perfect a note was enclosed saying they actually ran out of this size but another store was able to find them and shipi love that retailer did not even call and worry me over it they just fixed the problem thank you,1
5246,Finally got cold enough to wear this shirt i love itgot lots and lots of compliments great quality,1
5247,Its absolutely beautiful its a bit more than what i want to pay for a skirt but its worth every penny im a true size lbs and and it fits perfect very versatile,1
5248,I have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple the material is nice weight and has a stretch the cut has a little s vibe that i love i think it should keep its shape hopefully launders well i think it runs slightly large as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me i will rebuy this,1
5249,This top is lightweight and flows nice i usually take a medium or large i ordered a medium and it is slightly large so if you are between sizes i would go down i will keep the medium because it isnt the type of blouse that should hug your body the green is stunning,1
5250,The color pattern in this material pops a lot more in person than on the website fits perfectly very versatile regardless of the occasion or the season at least in california love it,1
5251,Even on sale salethis tank is not worth the money the design in the back is adorable would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsythink old man white tanks that come in a pack completely see through and lack of shapei wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality,0
5252,This is so retailer pretty in pink unique design and print i love origami and i love pink and this blouse is a perfect combo i ordered size petite s im b waist hips and it fits perfectly the hem falls on the upper hips just like shown on the model the top has structure not too soft and not too stiff i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms like me this top has everything flair bright color unique print but al,1
5253,Love this tunic very comfortable and a perfect length to the knee i wore it to a birthday party with brown booties the green moss color is perfect for the fall in new england cant wait to wear it again,1
5254,Gorgeous linen blend tee purchased in grey and white classic timeless staples fits baggy which i love for reference i am a lbs love love love,1
5255,Too wide the design is cute but the wideness of the overall piece and arms made me lose my shape you cant see your figure underneath at all i dont like pieces like that this went back,0
5256,I love the dress as shown in the photo thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store it is sheer can see thru it can not wear this to work,0
5257,Lovey top in the photos however its fairly large and the chest area can make you look even larger im lbs c generally wear xs or s in retailer tops ordered the xs but it was just too large and unflattering the lace work is so pretty it has potential but the design doesnt work well for some,0
5258,This fit great i am and lbs i ordered a size medium and it fit perfect i wore a black tankcami underneath for warmth in the office,1
5259,I love the design thats why im going back for a smaller size i bought a medium and that size was made for someone lbs heavier than i usually im good at choosing my size online but not today if you are curvy and round like me still go for a smaller size because this dress has a lot if room also i wish more clothes would come into the stores to try on please,0
5260,I love the simplicity of this its not fussy at all i fell in love with the green color online fortunately someone had returned a green to my closest store though it wasnt my size the color is even better in personi tried on the blue also pretty in a and as im all over the place in retailer sizing i couldve taken either but the had too much material on top for me i ordered the im hoping it wont be too short for church,1
5261,I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top at im rather busty short waisted and fullfigured i ordered my usual size and the fit is a flattering almost empire silhouette i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape but it works great the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece,1
5262,I so wanted this top in red and tried on the but it was a little biglong on my frame lbs dd i tried ordering petite but it was sold out te only one available was the honey color so i decided to try it even though i am very pale well i actually do like it it isnt as popping as the red but it is super flattering and the color is actually classy so i feel like i could wear this with a dressier outfit not just casual i love the feel the fabric is airy great,1
5263,I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics i love browsing the retailer store its a feast for my sensesthe pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in personall three feel different due to their color and pattern to me the burned orange feels like country and fall the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer they all look very cute oni did size down and still got the oversize flowing lookthis,1
5264,Its very pretty i purchased mine in the floral romantic floral the peplum is true to photos it isnt short as many are the print is gorgeous and the fabric is soft and comfortable and the styling is perfect,1
5265,This dress was very boxy and unflattering i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back,0
5266,I ordered these jeans on sale based on the great reviews but when the arrived the color looked different from the online pictures i dont love the color but decided to try them on anyway since ive never tried ag before well they are so soft and comfortable and fit great i didnt want to take them off so i ended up keeping them now ag is my favorite brand for jeans,1
5267,This dress was love at first sight i did have to size down from my normal size but the dress is so comfortable and cool as another reviewer said it does shrink after first wash but perfect now since i am it shrank about one inch in length only i got many compliments and my husband said it was beautiful thats a plus i was comfortable and cool all day get it before it is out of stock this dress will not make it to sale,1
5268,This is just as cute in person i wear it with black jean shorts boyfriend jeans washed out jeans like the model or khakis the colors are great and so is the fit love it,1
5269,Color is not like photo and fit doesnt work if youre busty,0
5270,This top is full of amazing details the photos really dont do it justice it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my frame but because of the detailingit just works,1
5271,Very comfortable and cute true to size a look for three seasons,1
5272,The retailer stylist had showed me this on my way out of the fitting room and im so glad she did i went back in to try it on and loved it it almost has a spanx like stretch to the material which perfectly keeps its shape and is so well made i also really liked the open part in the back because it adds an extra something to the dress but you can still wear a strapless bra if you desire i plan on wearing it at the beach on the th of july,1
5273,I am absolutely shocked that so many people love this dress maybe i should have sized up and reconsidered but i still dont think it would have worked the fabric is very soft but thats where its qualities for me ended the knot felt huge to me and definitely added unnecessary size to my already curvy hips for reference im and hourglass dd the cut at the bottom also felt very strange and restrictive to me like i would have had to take smaller steps to walk around in it,0
5274,Love this jacket got it in the charcoal color i especially enjoy the collar and the handy pockets,1
5275,Perfect for the change in weather this sweater is very thick and a tad big i would say it is true to size but if youre like me and usually order up in sweaters and outerwear dont there is ample room for layering underneath without being too cumbersome the color is a bit different than that shown it is more of a blush heather with light gray threads intertwined just a note the pin does not come with the sweater the closeup made me think it did but it really doesnt matter the color,1
5276,I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did there were ruffles on my shirt the one thing i didnt know was how wide the top ran i ordered my usual size and it fit with no problems im a b the only thing is that in the model shot the shirt is tucked into the pants and you dont get to see the full volume of it even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesnt show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt its not a big problem since the shirt can be tucked but i will have,1
5277,I was a bit nervous ordering this dress because it had so much going on but i have to say its beautiful on its stretchy and super comfortable as well i usually struggle with tight pencil like dresses but this is stretchy and super comfy no riding up on me i cannot say enough good things about this dress its just so flattering and i get so many compliments when i wear it,1
5278,I couldnt wait to try this on because i love the brand holding horses this dress did not disappoint although i detest the difficulty with side zippers why cant they simply return to the back seam i was easily able to pull this dress on because it had some give to the fabric once on the dress has a very flattering fit over the bust the wrap over bodice is already secured with a stitch and through the tummy i believe these were sized sm l so i took my regular mediumlength wise par,1
5279,Im c and lbs i ordered the size p and while the color and fabric is pretty the back and front bodice were much to low to wear a bra even if i were to shorten the straps it was also very tight across my ribs despite ordering a petite the hem was much too long i ended up returning it,0
5280,I have worn this sweater many times i have received great compliments,1
5281,I bought these leggings for yoga i love them the material is so soft and also seems sweat wicking which is a plus the back detail on the calf is a nice touch of flair compared to basic leggings the waistband is wide and did not fold over during practice for reference i am lbs and i purchased a m fit was great i normally wear size in pants would recommend,1
5282,Love this product got them in the coral and they are comfortable easy flattering versatiledressed up or down they always look good they hang beautifully and their ease comfort make them my go to staple in this southern heat,1
5283,My favorite white blouse everi was hesitant but really love it it makes me think of summer flowers paris its so soft and comfortable yes the cut is different and took a moment to get used to but i like that and it looks better on imo i can see this getting worn a lot on hot summer southern days ive been on a hunt for a great white blouse for a long time tres chic,1
5284,These are colors i normally never wearbaby pink lavender light bluebut what drew me to this was the wine color mixed in its my favorite i also adore a good poncho this poncho is so rich and so heavenly super soft very oversized incredibly nice fabricits like a light weight sweater lots of movement and such a statement piece it will look great over a white tank top or an all black ensemble with great boots this only comes in two sizes but runs large im and curvyand,1
5285,Great color but frumpy fit if you have any bust it looks a bit like maternity,0
5286,Great tunic top is longer than i thought it would be so i probably could have sized down definitely covered my butt but overall a great print and cute top loving it,1
5287,Based on reviews i got the medium pink size petite because some said it was tight in the bust area and pulled at the buttons creating a gap im and d i figured the petite would be big enough in the bust area and the petite would be shorter it was too big and even though it was petite still too long wanted to like it but at full price decided to return,1
5288,This chambray is super soft it has such a great feel and texture i love the detail and design on the front it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways im not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirtstops but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my which isnt large so excited to get a lot of use out of this,1
5289,I wanted to love this so much that i ordered in both a mp and sp both have gone back im petite and curvy particularly on top i wear petites of the time this didnt fit like a petite it was cut like full size in every way particularly the arm holes and length when the mp didnt fit i always start trying on in the larger size i thought well surely the small will be better i considered keeping because i would wear it with jackets over it then decided that was crazy disappoin,0
5290,Ive been craving this dress in the brown pattern for a while and should have jumped the gun before the sale so now i was left with size sp and i look like a foollike im trying to wear a top from junior high and pass it off as a dress my shoulders,1
5291,I would of paid double the amount for this romper i am a medium and the medium fits perfect i am a little long in the torso so some rompers arent comfortable but this one is this is going to be a summer staple for sure,1
5292,Im writing because i ordered this dress and live it im usually a medium but bc so many said it ran small i ordered a largeit was huge and i wear a d it was huge everywhere so now hoping the medium fits,1
5293,The material is wonderful and the dress is lined plenty of room in the bodice area for a d bust will be wearing a lot this season,1
5294,At i guess i am just too short to pull this dress off the colors are so pretty for summer but there is just too much fabric i felt like i was wearing a giant doily however there is not a doubt in my mind that taller girls would look fabulous in this,0
5295,I am a pilcro hyphen girl and now i have these pants to love as well super comfy and cute the print is nice and subtle im usually a p but the regular is fine,1
5296,I bought this dress for an awards ceremony and couldnt be more pleased the quality and detailing on the dress are great and the hidden side zipper makes the dress easy to put on i love that its machine washable on a delicate setting ive already worn it twice and cant wait to wear it again for easter,1
5297,The rocket by citizens of humanity are my favorite jeans perfect high rise and still makes the butt look good they are incredibly comfortable no more hiking up your jeans and bending over love these so much am very happy that j brand and citizens are making some good high rises now wont buy anything else,1
5298,I tried this dress on in the store i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes its loose fitting so i went with the xs the arm holes were tight but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath which adds a nice touch great length not too short or too long the grey color is much prettier in person i felt it had a little more of a blue tint for reference i am lbs and b,1
5299,I love this blouse it reminds me of something out of europe with the swiss dot and crochet delicate sleeves i ordered the xsp and it fits perfect im so the shortness of the top isnt a factor the material drapes nicely and doesnt make me look wide or boxy i was afraid that the sleeves were going to be overly puffy put luckily they are not the only thing to note is that the color is more on the tan beige side rather than pink i find with a lot of retailer tops that the colors are,1
5300,I tried wearing it however i thought i needed courage to wear this tankunfortunately i did not purchase this tank although i liked color and designfirst it runs small than the regular size it feels even smaller because my size is xsin addition it tends to exaggerate a body linei am not quite sure why this happens but maybe it is just the way this tank isif you are confident about your upper body posture then yes it would look very coolhowever if you have thin postur,0
5301,The print on this is gorgeous and its incredibly comfortable ultimately i didnt buy it because the length was weird for me im it just looked strange like it was cutting me off at a weird point,1
5302,I like it a lot very soft just enough detail to keep it interesting but still a classic look i got this in a small and its a little short on me compared to the model im longwaisted b small side lbs carry bulk of my weight in legsso trim on top i will keep the small but also get a medium the small ties a little high and i also want a sweater that can cover my shirt tails when i dont tuck them in i got it in black so cant comment on the orange or red,1
5303,Love it i am and usually a size or in bottoms typically size up for holding horses based on other reviews i ordered this in a it stretched just a bit after wearing all day so im glad i didnt get my normal the fit is great quality is great it dresses up for a casual office day wearing well with boots and tights and i imagine pairing with tshirt and flip flops over the summer i unique piece that quickly became a favorite,1
5304,I loved this skirt when i tried it on the material is soft with a bit of stretch id say this runs a little large for reference im usually a size in retailer and the was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out however my disappointment was with the buttonsi wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off fine that button is the most used i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of,0
5305,This blouse is flattering and fits great i also have the other color in cream with the floral design very nice,1
5306,This shirt is so cute its so soft love the lace element on the arm definitely thinking of ordering the white the back for me is a lot longer then the pic shows but i think it looks good,1
5307,I used to be a solid then had to move down to and i am and lbs in this definitely a the tighter part in the fitted waist is why i recommend peiople sizing up if you are between sizes choose bigger teh cutis so flattering it wont matterthe colros are really pretty the flow of the shirt is romantic sleeves are forgivin cant go wrong hte back is a little longer and covers the tushy i can see this with flared bottoms or pencil skirt or skiny jeans even,1
5308,My experience with these have been great and the colors are even more beautiful in person theyre easy to dress up for work and going out and easy to dress down for hanging out on the weekends i am typically a size and s fit me like a glove i also typically wear petite but dont like the justabovetheankle cut of these so i purchased them in regular and wear them as pants i can uncuff them with healswedges or keep the double cuff and they hit me perfectly as fulllength pants wi,1
5309,Have had a hard time finding comfy dresses appropriate but not too long for my year old daughter purchased this tunic in a regular xs and she loves it she wore today with suede bootiesvery soft cute and longer than many dresses sold for teens she initially thought it was a winter sweater dress but i explained it is mostly cotton and would be a great transitional piece for spring and fall,1
5310,This top is super versatilei wear it with jeans on the weekend but its also work appropriate its light and perfect for warm weather,1
5311,Its a beautiful skirt the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering,1
5312,When i tried it on it was a bit shapeless but it was on a promo so i decided to get it i kind off like shapeless ive worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended in a lingerie bag always and air dried it it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam and i cannot see how this happened the inner lining is soft and substantial but the outer gauze layer is thin,0
5313,I feel that for this price i should love this top and i wanted to however the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top and there were a few things about it that could be improvedpros i ordered a medium and feel that its pretty true to size additionally the fabric is nice and light but also sheer and generally speaking has a nice pattern overall its a very pretty topcons theres a cute crisscross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly,0
5314,I really like this jacket very comfortable nice material i like the weight of this jacket i wore it alone but it will be cute with a tshirt under it too,1
5315,Im super happy with the way these jeans fit i typically buy ag jeans for fit and quality this pair is extremely comfy with the right amount of stretch yet still somewhat relaxed they do run a big large so i sized down and they still fit great lots of compliments,1
5316,This dress is beautiful and surprisingly flattering i never wouldve picked this up for myself but im so glad i did its also super comfortable,1
5317,This skirt is great for the office but also stylish enough to wear out to drinksdinner afterwards i think it fits a little big im usually s and i ended up with an xsi think the tan is a little cuter than the gray in person so i would recommend this one,1
5318,I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area it was fine for me as im not big busted,1
5319,I am quite happy with this dress i was wondering what the colors would look like in person and im happy to report that the skirt is a nice mellow orangecoral beautiful detail in the patterns used here and i always like a dress that has great colorplay close up and far away for reference i am a size full figured with a c bust and the size was just right for me sometimes with maeve dresses you can size down but there is no stretch to the dress or the slip so that is someth,1
5320,I tried this dress on today and ended up buying it its a thicker material and looks better in person more red and white striped with an uneven hem the back of the dress is a bit more like a swim suit i probably is best for smaller chests im guessing it runs a little bit big as the medium fit nicely on me and lately im a large mediumsmall large,1
5321,Great top i ordered online because i needed a white top that i could get away with wearing in fall to work even though its white im busty and normally shirts like this make me look gigantic like im going to tip over but this was a very flattering cut and fit i highly recommend it was also comfortable and i wore it with blue slacks to work the flower is partially dark blue im and the length was perfect not too long in the butt but enough to cover it subtly,1
5322,I bought the xs in green and every time i wear it i get compliments all day its a more youthful style than i usually wear but i couldnt resist the dark green color i wear this with black leggings and flats and its a perfect dress for a school day,1
5323,I bought this impulsively to wear to a wedding and im so glad i did it is so soft and comfy and gorgeousand has pockets its loose but really really flattering somehow i would typically get a size in a fitted dress but the medium was perfect for me,1
5324,This shirt is perfect bought charcoal and ivory compliments galore super cute with jeans workout pants love it,1
5325,I love this dress i would definitely accessorize with a belt my body type fits best in this style of dress because i dont have a big bust size if you do i would try it on first for being shorter i love the length,1
5326,This top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers so many nice details and a great fit,1
5327,Love these shorts such a pretty print,1
5328,I had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it i love all things bows but usually they are offcentered over the left shoulder i have a bit of an ocd thing and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them i cant wear them i love that this bow is in the middleand i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look i feel,1
5329,I ordered this coat in the pink color actually it is a coal color papaya and will be wonderful with gray black khaki and great with animal print accessories the fit is just as it looks online no surprises this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets for anyone who remembers themone concern since the wool is light,1
5330,I bought this top on sale in the store and immediately came home and ordered it in another color online i love the length even in the xs which isnt always the case i am and a size and the xs fits me perfect even after washing and drying a couple times looks cute under sweaters and vests can wear all year round lightweight and good neckline,1
5331,Love this top it is almost universally flattering and washes beautifully it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings but soooo much better if you are on the fence on this one i highly recommend you give it a try,1
5332,This top has the thickness and comfort of a sweatshirt with artistic flair and a figure flattering unique cut it works very well on me as im a petite large i only wish it was a little roomier or that i was lbs lighter but its stretchy and i really love wearing it the color is a rich indigo with a slightly worn look which adds texture and dimension,1
5333,Great fit looks excellent with jeans as well as tucked in with a pencil skirt,1
5334,I purchased this blazer in both striped versions for work its basically a blazersweatshirt hybridwhile it does run true to size i can wear a small or medium in retailer i purchased medium in this dont size down if your size is ambiguous,1
5335,I ordered a regular size s and it was way too boxy for my body type and shorter than the stated length i dont know if the length stated is from a size m but the small was definitely shorter in the front at least if youre petite with curves like me its not a flattering cut,0
5336,I bought this in store on sale and absolutely love it,1
5337,Purchased these in both colors today great sale pricehei hei is my favorite brand of pants especially their pull on printsi am always a medium these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in eachthe beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous they have a lovely silky feel to them i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness wont bother me being on,1
5338,I wanted to love these jeans but as a woman who is almost there was way too much stretch in them i am always a size and i couldnt wear these they were way too tight they went back the next day i will say it could be my body type im a runner so my legs are muscular if you have very thin legs these could be great and work for you i loved the color dark blue,0
5339,These are my favorite pants i love the fit and they are comfortable i have them in several colors i hope you never discontinue them,1
5340,Great fit can be dressy or casual goes with everything i adore tis jacket,1
5341,I didnt think anything of this top online i really dont care for how they styled it but in store it was more interesting im currently anywhere between a xssm depending on the style lb b size regular in this top fit me perfectly for some reason on me the sleeves were elongating and flattering closer to my elbow and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but due to the color and p,1
5342,I really like this dress it does not bother me that it is not lined i feel very feminine wearing it i plan to get a shrug to wear with it,1
5343,I wanted to love this however the fit was funky and the colors were muted this is definitely something you must try on in the store too risky to buy online due to weird fit,0
5344,I really love this rosepink color the pants fit like a glove the cuff is not sewn up so you can lower the cuff to where you like it,1
5345,Love this vest saw it and bought it instantly im and slim and got the xs it fits perfectly there is a lot of puff to it but its really warm and soft,1
5346,Spotted this in the local store last week just had to try it on it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way my usual size small was too big the oversized look was fine from front back view but in the side view the bottom stuck way out the xs was much better so i took it home its very comfy looks great with dark blue denim,1
5347,I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and dusterlove it,1
5348,These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid i could not get these socks to go any higher than halfway up my calf i would not recommend this product it felt very cheap and not of good quality,0
5349,Sexy yet sweet and demure all points checked with cute little number this is the third byron dress ive bought and like the melodist i purchased the p and had the same issuetoo loose in the hips,1
5350,This beautiful dress is the perfect style for fall when i first picked this up i was surprised by how heavy it felt there is so much embroidery i thought the dress was lined with another layer however the fabric is not stiff there are numerous exquisite details including a button up bodice additional embroidery on the skirt and ladder lace on the sleeves i sized up to l because of my heavy backshouldersupper arms sizing up does make the bodice of the dress look a tad wider but n,1
5351,Bought this top for date night something a little special its that and also very comfortable i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates easy to dress up or down perfect,1
5352,This blouse has such a beautiful print but then it just goes down from there and cant be saved the fabric is a sheer silk so it comes with an attached camisole that just doesnt lay right underneath the sleeves are all gathered up and they have a puffy gather at the top that just ruins the whole blouse i wish it was just a simple popover type blouse because it really is a lovely print definitely not worth the money even at off plus,0
5353,I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer although nothing else in the load was blotchy i then because i loved the cut of these pants bought another pair in the darker blue color the same thing happened after the first wash again nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined just my new retailer pants such a bummer definitely a dye issue i called the stores i pur,0
5354,I love the style and look oft this blouse but the fit is a bit off for me im usually either a l or xl i dont think it came in an xl so i decided to give the l a shot i would say it runs roomy except through the arms i found the arms to run strangely tightand its not an area i usually have a problem with the body skimmed nicely over my trouble spots middle i found the neckline very flattering and it laid nicely over by dd bust the v is deep but you dont feel overexposed the b,1
5355,I bought this in blueblack it is so pretty i get so many compliments im a size but large busted i bought this in a medium its perfect just the right amount of fullness im so the length for me is perfect wleggings,1
5356,I absolutely love this top i bought it in white and ended up buying it in the lavender as well the top is very flattering and works with any occasion the fabric is a little thin but its fine with a nude bra i have worn the top to work and out at night and i always get lots of compliments,1
5357,I was thinking this would be a straight up terry cloth athleisure top but the subtle metallic thread woven into the cloud gray fabric elevates the style really loved the top because of the cut and interesting hemline but i adore it for the bit of sparkle,1
5358,I was fortunate to order the perfect size the first time i am and and ordered the size it is a great fit these lightweight pants are super cute and i especially love the way they are cut to dip a bit lower not asymmetrical just talking about the drape on the inside hem so outside hem is perky and the bottom looks wide and is flattering these zip up the back and the back lays flat which is also flattering i love the look of the fabric so if i have a complaint its that for the,1
5359,I love this jacket it is stylish and is ideal for a casual night out,1
5360,Ref g i dont think this is for us shorter women this hits you right where you dont want a vertical line to hit it flares out at your hip and makes you look shorter than you are the fabric is like a double gauze and very soft and the colors are beautiful but i couldnt even dream of making this work i thought maybe with my larger bust it would create shape but it looks like i just wrapped a bunch of fabric around me glad i tried instore and didnt online order,0
5361,Ive been anticipating the arrival of these pants and was literally at the doorstep with ups i have a birthday celebration visiting wineries and thought this would be the perfect outfitit did not disappoint fits like a glovevery flattering and comfy i am and ordered a small petite not too short but still have the option of wearing sandals i hesitated because of the price but so worth it,1
5362,This coat is fun flirty flattering i bought it strictly for how good it looks on its not a coat for warmth the top is tailored and fitted but the bottom is very full and swings there is a lot of fabric on the bottom im not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me however i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it so keep that in mind the small fit me perfect v,1
5363,This is a beautiful quality knit i do wish that it was a tad bit longerim with a long torso and found it to hit like the model shot since the sweater flares a little at the bottom i think it might be more flattering a little longer keeping this regardless because it will still get plenty of wear,1
5364,I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors it is so comfortable and very flattering i am so many tunics are more like shirts on me but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants the v neck is a nice feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges,1
5365,Cute easy to wear perfect little top will go with so many things the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch im a solid with a pretty large chest i think i need to go up not sure about to order a to see if there is a big difference so if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes,1
5366,I loved the fit and design so much that i splurged and purchased all three the lavender has a blue tinge to it that makes it really unique the coral is a little on the neon side but i love that and its a great color for summer im waiting for the white to arrive and hope its actually white and not ivory as retailer colors are sometime a little off im petite and order the xxsp which fits like a dream not too tight or loose super comfortable and flattering easy to pair with white khaki,1
5367,Love everything about it chunky comfortable lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace,1
5368,Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing helpful for visitors and children i purchased a s as it does run a bit large,1
5369,Charming dress fit perfectly with great movement through back and chest area flattering lengths with just the right amount of fabric inside dress sheath or slip dress zips to waist for fit i am smitten with the dress just love it,1
5370,The sweater is as cute in person as it is online,1
5371,I am totally in love with this sweater it is lightweight comfortable and very versatile throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear the color is not a light red but rather a rich cabernet wine color this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites,1
5372,I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tentlike the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute feminine details,0
5373,Bought a large could barely pull up over my butt runs extremely small its cute but if your not a stick figure this is not the suit for you,0
5374,Appears much more sleek in the photograph in real life this shirt looks more like a pajama top thin extremely casual not worth the price i paid even in black will be exchanging it tomorrow,0
5375,Colors and patterns of this dress are beautiful and thats where it ends cheap flimsy polyester and no lining far too expensive for what it is on me it bulked out in my chest area and did not look so great i would say it runs a tad big but in my case i have wide shoulders not big enough to downsize too bad because i really love the colors and idea of this dress,0
5376,I love the color and style of this dress and i wanted to love it too sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure,0
5377,I do not even know where to begin with this product i ordered a small i go between small and medium and felt that would be a good fit after trying on the shirt i would have opted for the xxxxxxxxs or whatever the smallest size is this shirt is very boxy i know its supposed to have a flow to it but this shirt is too much it needs to be taken in or have a belt wrapped around it i tried the belt look but it did not look flattering i found this color to be very blah overall i am slig,0
5378,I probably wouldnt have even tried this on in the store but i took a chance when it was on sale i put it on and it was immediate love the fit is perfect i am between a medium and a large and got it in a large it is not boxy but not too tight either it feels well made,1
5379,Wow love this blazer its not as structured as some blazers but the woven fabric hugs in the right places fantastic addition and great alternative to the goodol black blazer great versatility work to play nice weight for fall but will also do well for my fl winter its longer than some of my other blazers but i like it with the front pockets as they are it makes for a unique design that gets noticed i got the size and i have broad shoulders for someone lbs makes for a n,1
5380,The dress runs large so if you go down a size you will be fine looks awesome on love it would definitely recommend,1
5381,So cute warm and fashionable i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size the arms are small and the rest is true to size love the quality softness and style of this with a hood for the win,1
5382,I purchased the black in the store and wore the next day so soft and lays nicely pretty sleeve detail quality and fit as expected the arm holes are a tad larger than i prefer but i typically wear a camisole under tops so it doesnt bother me for reference im c and purchased the medium,1
5383,So versatile and comfortable i plan adding this into my rotation year round under a jacket or cardigan during the colder months if you prefer baggier fit i would suggest going up a size,1
5384,These pants are fantastic the pattern alone is to die for but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star,1
5385,Wow i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on it is simply stunning the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it lol i cant wait to wear it,1
5386,I saw this skirt in retailer several months ago and while it caught my eye it was pricey so i waited until it went on sale and pounced unfortunately i ordered a size which is enroute i happened to stop by our local store today and decided to try on the and ended up getting a size so ill have to return the size when it arrives i think it runs tts ive lost alot of weight recently the colors are vibrant and it has a nice weight with some stretch in the fabric its a,1
5387,I saw this in the retailer catalogue and knew i had to own this dress everything about it speaks to me on a cellular level the colour the shape the drape the hem and the little side stripes be still my heart i went into my local store and picked up the dress in xl and l to try on im currently a new body shape because of too many burgers a sports injury and not enough cardio so i figured i should size up for a moment uh no the xl was like a tent fabric everywhere i pulled,1
5388,This dress is a bit longer than photographed but i was totally ok with that the skirt is also a bit fuller which makes the dress more formal its really well made and great material im lb and bought a size,1
5389,Loved this pilcro denim jacket slight stretch wellconstructed white denim with yellowgold stitching it is short and very nice fittingversatile runs tts i am lbs d and small fit perfectly i really like it and am not put off at all with thread color actually gives it some character mine did have a pen mark on the back but as usual retailers great customer service provided a solution,1
5390,I feel really cool wearing this skirt a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform loooks great with short boots im wearing it as i write this reviewand was wearing it all day awesome skirt,1
5391,This dress is beautiful the pictures do not do it justice i love the fabric and overall feel of the dress light and airy i have very broad shoulders and i did not feel like it look good on me so i am sending it back too bad for me i think the dress is perfect for weddings parties and even everyday wear,1
5392,This is a fantastic top to wear with the paige high wasted flair jeans love it,1
5393,Beautiful top loved the color but shoulders were totally messed up and not sure if it was fromhanging at store or the way it was sewn,0
5394,As part of the over crowd i rarely wear dresses any more but this called out to me and it didnt disappoint i ordered the plum true to size and and color i usually wear a medium and it fit perfectly i liked the previous review suggestion and i will also wear this with boots and tshirt to get more use out of it as well as dressing upits a real keeper,1
5395,Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint i ordered a xxs in black and it was perfect i am and lbs it definitely has a lot of volume to it but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer so you can see through it to your thinner figure underneath it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it which makes it flattering another reviewer mentioned the beading turning i have not seen that on mine but now i will be looking for i,1
5396,Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab keeps you warm or cool as appropriate doesnt ride up and looks good this is it it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down but once you do you say ahhh it feels good and is a blessinga seamless bit of control of middleage middlebody flab for sizing i wear a size in most clothes and in this cami i can wear a smallmedium or a mediumlarge the former pulls in more but the later gives m,1
5397,Ordered this top the second i saw iti wear a small or med depending on the cut and fabricnoticed it is cotton and went with a mediumso happy i went with the larger sizeruns very small especially in the chest and there is no give in the fabricstunning top but would go up one possibly two sizes,1
5398,I love this top i got it on sale and am so glad that i did it is a short too but still super flattering it isnt too boxy on me,1
5399,This dress was a maybe for me online but when i tried it on i was totally won over i got the raspberry which is a really pretty color i have dd chest and it fits nicely on me fairly true to size and is super flattering on me more so than most swing dresses love it,1
5400,Wow i had been looking at these shorts onlinethen found only one pair left at my store in a size foura size i can sometimes squeeze intoluckily these really do run a full size larger without being snugtoo tight with off yes please cannot wait to wear them next summer and ps per above reviewer you do need need to cut the cross strings at the pleatsthey are just meant to keep the shorts nicely pressedflat in the store then you are on your own,1
5401,The moment i laid eyes on this beauty i was mesmerized theres so much going on with the print but it all works its so fun and flattering and versatile since the variety of colors go with just about every thing i own in my closet it can be fancied up or casualed down depending on your shoes and accessories like the first reviewer recommended size down i bought an instead of and my bust is dd with a wide rib cage i really wish this was a midi on me but alas no petite sizes w,1
5402,This shirt is so comfortable and soft it has a great fit it is a little thin but i can get away with wearing it by itself i love it,1
5403,This is really cute with a statement necklace or without jeans or shorts love it,1
5404,Love the lace on the back its a sweet take on a typical tee comfy a little on the boxier side but a great tee,1
5405,These are worth the money gorgeous fit soft denim and make my body look long and sleek especially my bottom i wear mine w a white tee underneath and plan to add booties for the fall but for now platform clogs fabulous,1
5406,I love the classy design and the little surprise bow in the back i am and about lbs size fit well i was afraid it might be too short but on me it is just above the knee the bow on the back did not hide the bra strap on me but the fabric is thick overall so that it can be worn without one the fit is great once on but it is a little hard to take off since the zipper is not on the side so there is no relief in the armchest area the color is beautiful its true to the pictures,1
5407,Very cute easy to wear and looks professional great for work or a weekend love this top,1
5408,These literally are more comfortable than sweatpants they are definitely relaxed and look a little baggier on than in the photo but still cute and flattering,1
5409,I bought this in size xl it ran much shorter smaller than is typical for this brand i found the arms tighter on me compared to the models photos the lace itself was pretty intricate and washed well i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times the cropped length and closefit just didnt work on me i thought the sleeve shape was pretty with just a little more material this would have been a favorite i hope it works well on whoever receives i,0
5410,I ordered the skirt on friday and it arrived on monday my expectations were exceeded the fabric is great quality and there are subtle flecks of gold throughout the fabric is substantial but not stiff at all for this type of skirt you need a thicker fabric im about lbs and i ordered a regular the fit everything from the length to how it fell on the hips is perfect cant wait to wear this skirt,1
5411,I love this shirt it is classic and elegant it is versatile and can go with lots of different things be mindful it is seethrough so you must wear a tank underneath i got it in white and it can be dressed up or down i like how the sleeves are slightly longer than your average shirt definitely recommend,1
5412,I love this dress so much ive considered getting it in the other prints its fitted in all the right places and has pockets i love that its stretchy im a d and its hard to fit dresses over the chest this dress is a dream,1
5413,But i have no idea where i would wear this dress i tried on the size in store someone had returned it but i always loved the cut and color of this dress been in my wish list so i tried it on anyway it is so lovely the cut is super flattering the bow on the chest is beautiful and the colors are much nicer in person pinker the feel is a bit satinlike soft i would need the as it was a bit wide on the chest but not a petite surprisingly usually do need petite in dressesif,1
5414,I really liked the design ordered a medium which was huge also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material a bit itchy returned it,0
5415,The fit is true to size the quality is nice i am happy to having this basic wardrobe staple added to my closet,1
5416,This skirt is great the fabric is so soft and light i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldnt be too transparent and it wasnt the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice the color is exactly as shown i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up i shouldnt have the skirt was too big in the waist and too long so i exchanged and the fit was right on i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist so keep that in mind the only t,1
5417,Contrary to what previous reviewers have said i think this top fits really well and is very flattering i also dont find it too long at all i normally wear a size small and got this in a size no gapping at the chest and im a d lbs and the colors in the striped version are really pretty i plan to wear it now and right through spring i did have a quality issue however the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po,1
5418,I ordered it online so i wasnt sure how thick the sweater coat would be and when i received it i was pleasantly surprised at the thickness and high quality definitely worth the price,1
5419,Absolutely love this dress so cute with booties and a jean jacket will be a great staple for spring and fall,1
5420,I bought both of these tees and they are perfect under my new fringe denim cloth stone shirt and dress had to have both the gray tee is so cute has every color of all my pilcro chinoswhat a bonus looks too cute paired with the denim shirts and is a great fall transition i dressed up the cowboy tee with a chunky green stone necklace i bought the small and for reference am and h bra size and have no pulling so they are tts and only slightly shaped which works perfect for us bus,1
5421,Fantastic and comfortable top i had to buy in black and white because it was too cute to buy just one love it great staple for your wardrobe,1
5422,Was very surprised when i opened the package this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all i have a short waist length so it should have worked the color is a little darker than pictured but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced going back asap,0
5423,Beautiful top the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school its a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but its beautiful definitely worth getting,1
5424,Absolutely love this little shift i bought it on a whim really it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the s crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar this is not that sort of velvet its also not some cheap polyester looking knockoff of true velvet i always find those to have a somewhat plastic sheen to them that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur,1
5425,Very nice sweater surprisingly just as pictured colorwise i ordered a large and it felt true to size in the shoulders but this sweater flair out to the bottom you can kind of see it in the photo the length is good as well for a regular fit its very unique combination of fabric acrylicwool knit the texture is really nice and soft and looks very good on also its thick and warm i wore the top to work today on degree weather and received many compliments sweater looks simple but the,1
5426,Im very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy it it absolutely adorable and the classic plaid is timeless as first reviewer said the styling of this on the model does it no favors it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering forgiving way the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section then flares out on the bottom section that bottom flare can sometimes add inchespounds but this top does it in a very modern subtle and flattering fashion and the mater,1
5427,After reading the other reviewers i decided to try this out unfortunately the material does not fall nicely on me and the belt hits in an unflattering spot i like the idea but its just not a flattering cut or material going back,0
5428,I was very disappointed in the quality of this top the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front i had to pull the thread under so it wasnt exposed i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine this top is extremely delicate and doesnt withstand normal everyday casual wear although its s casual lightweight sweater now its just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt,0
5429,This shirt is amazing its soft comfortable i cant speak yet as to how well it will hold up but i plan on wearing it a lot the cut is great the shirt flutters away from under the empire waist line and the nylon patch in the back creating a flattering shape without clinging anywhere the sleeves are nice long and fittedthis shirt will work great as a winterfall basic piece but the texture color and contrast detail in the back make it interesting on its own very versatilethe col,1
5430,Love the lightweight fabric looks great with skinny jeans it is flowy but flatteringwearing it on my shoulders for work,1
5431,Buttons were broken off when i opened the package stretchy at waist not good quality for the price,0
5432,I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it it is as one of the reviewers said like having two dresses in one the bottom dress is a full dress and the top lays over it not quite skimming but not quite loose either i love the dress as i am a pear shaped size and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries,1
5433,Bought these and they fit really well and are super comfy love the color will probably live in them this summer,1
5434,First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention with that said i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to dressed up or down so i found myself ordering it asap paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing well i received it in the mail and it was better than i thought the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture i personally love this articlepattern of art as i see it as an exp,1
5435,I skipped over these when they first cme in store but it was reccomended to me to try them on so i did and i loved them they look like a skirt which is amazing but you wont be worrying on those breezy days they run very big im usually a or in pants and i got the xs and feel like i could have even sized down but thats the smallest size carried in store i got them in the green because i felt that the color went more with the casual feel of the pant if you are interested i,1
5436,I am a sucker for bows so decided to try this one and ordered it i went with the petite without trying on the regular size in hindsight i should have ordered both but tit fit very nicely in petite so keeping it length is as on the model right at hip the colros of hte bow are well represented on the picture light pink light mustard yellow and navy so i stil lthink it is neutral ebough to mix with other colors warm or cold palette love hte button detial in the back i ordered xs an,1
5437,This color is really cool because it can go with black grey or tan shoes the back pleats are unique and do not add bulk the back is also lined so you dont need a tank fits tts and i thought it was fairly flattering on sale this is a great deal,1
5438,This dress is beautiful and very flattering i bought the and am and lbs it fits right at the knee and is flowy but still gives some shape without looking baggy i love it,1
5439,If youre like me and wish you could carry on downtown boho dressing when the time to take out your puffer comes to pass this tunic is essential though the silky alpacawool knit is thicker than gauzy cotton it drapes just as well and keeps ones self warm and cozy without the bulk of a sweater i was concerned with the elastic banding at the bottom of the tunic because im only but highwaisted and banded hems tends to always hit me at the wrong spot luckily its not very binding s,1
5440,I love the pure and good short sleeve tees they feel beautiful and wash beautifully i just hang them to dry and they are perfect for the next time i buy a size medium as i like them to flow nicely at the hips,1
5441,I love this dress colors are great but a little tight in the chest and arms i am and usually wear a size i bought the medium because i like a little looser fit on top the arm holes are a little large which makes reaching up for things awkward,1
5442,Has anyone tried to hand wash this dress instead of drycleanruns a little large i am dd and purchased xs i was really surprised that xs fits well i initially tried small but the armholes were too big the waist is a little too high but i plan to wear it with a belt,1
5443,This sweater is a great comfy fall or winter sweater in several of the pictures the neck is folded down so beware that the neck has a bit of a turtleneckmock neck look to it it can be folded down if thats not the look youre going for cute sweater,1
5444,This is going to be a favorite the fabric is substantial without being heavy it has a beautiful drape this blouse is loose but skims the body closer rather than being blousy it works perfectly worn with a skirt or pants and belted or tucked but is not too blousy if left unbelted i purchased the black with the lovely feather pattern the colors are vibrant im always looking for something black with some color because i tend to wear a lot of black on the bottom this fit true to size i am,1
5445,This skirt is a nice medium weight and is lined my normal size fit perfect i only wish it was available in petites if you are petite the skirt is ankle length but this is a good skirt to wear to work,1
5446,I did not have to size up or down because of my body type broad padded back wide rib cage narrow hips small bum however it fits a little odd on me the back darts that start at the waist and are supposed to curve for your behind settle too high and wrinkle the waist is also too high the shoulders are a bit tight i am confused because i bought the exact same size pieced brocade the colorful version of this dress and that one actually fits spot on i have a feeling if i go to the store,1
5447,I bought this tshirt in pink blue red grey and black over the past year every one of them except the grey has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline ive returned them all the fabric is thin and the quality of the tshirt is terrible,0
5448,Oh how i dread online shopping for bikinisespecially bottoms however these bottoms are incredible the fit is perfect you know when you are wearing normal underwear and you ask yourself why cant bathing suit bottoms just fit like this these bikini bottoms do you cant tell by the picture but they are a really great weightnot too thick and bulkyvery flatteringperfect rear coveragedoesnt pinch your sidestruly the most flattering bottoms ive found in a long time worth,1
5449,This fabric feels a little bit like heaven i would totally wear this out and not just with my jammies its adorable and the fabric is so soft i think im in love im lbs xxsmall was a perfect fit,1
5450,This is a beautiful top it extended longer than i had hoped and a petite size was not available so i ended up returning it but it is beautiful and the tassels on the sides make it truly unique,1
5451,Absolutely adore the simplicity and style of this dress dress is quite flowy the fabric under the pleats is very soft making is quite comfortable,1
5452,I just tried these on at my local seattle store and ended buying a size up i feel they ran small as i am usually a in most and got the in these the fit tight but it looked nothing special just like a very high rise mom jean and i was bursting the top button so this jean is made for hourglass bodies for sure the is loose and slouchy and it looked really different in a good way so it came home with me they are a washed out black grey color with some tie die effects did not care fo,1
5453,I love the sweatshirt clay color is very different its a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite great light sweatshirt for spring and summer,1
5454,Such a great dress it is super flattering i love that its not too short on mei am,1
5455,I am most pleased with this tunic purchased it in red nice quality and very comfortable casual top it has a flattering cut that isnt boxy for a long tunic so its flattering the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesnt add any bulk which is a bit slimming it would work well for a wide variety of body types i may buy the blue as well,1
5456,Im always on the lookout for pieces that look polished but arent fussy this is that blazer im rather petite and bought the xs though wish they had the petite in store to try on as xs is not very fitted on my frame the perfect weight for degree summer days,1
5457,Not sure who named this dress but it isnt a swing dress its a beautiful dress out of very soft fabric with elegant embroidery design and pretty fringe detail and pockets ive worn this dress with tennis shoes leather flip flops and heels and been complimented each time love this dress,1
5458,Generally i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses the bust was way to small so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me its till way too small in addition the shipping was terrible the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this and the right strap was defective its so irritating that i have to return this again,0
5459,I love this dress perfect fit and very good quality,1
5460,This is the sort of top i love to find at retailer its versatile because the fabric is comfortable enough to wear everyday and the lace gives it a dressy feminine feel i love the navy because the white behind it shows up the lace beautifully the yellow behind the white is also very pretty its fuller than it looks in the product shots even in an xxs its long on me at but its fine not sure i can wear with shorts because of the length but good with a mini the neck is also a little h,1
5461,Originally got one with a stain retailer quickly sent a replacementuseful with many skirts and pants well made,1
5462,The colors are richer than shown very vibrant this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit so i went a size up just for a looser look it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe,1
5463,I am a collector of clothes and textiles that is a passion this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh i am so happy to own this blouse it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful stylish in my own style,1
5464,I love paige jeans and these are no exception the wash is so so great a faded blackcharcoal grey its like having two pairs of jeans in one i am normally a in most jeans and thats what i took in these highly recommend,1
5465,Cute comfy and would highly recommend them to others i plan on getting one more color because i feel like i will wear them all the time,1
5466,This sweater is so beautiful soft and warm the neck is a little different and meant to be worn off the shoulder i dont wear it off the shoulder if you just work with it a bit it will lay nicely i get compliments every time i wear it,1
5467,I loved the shirt until i washed it awful fabric quality cheaply made,0
5468,I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color the color is to me like a lavender mauvish color but the description is actually natural i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe i found the size to be true,1
5469,I love this dress the length is great and the dress just feels great the material is raw silk which i love and the sizing does run a tad large but with the make of the dress i can lose weight and still wear the dress well made and the buttons in back are super cute,1
5470,As other reviews have mentioned this top has serious craftsman ship flaws strings hanging off embellishments on sleeves and they begin unravelling as you try the top on i wanted to love but sadly returned asap,0
5471,I had to order this dress in three different sizes to get it right im and but have a petite frame with curves so i ordered the small petite the sleeves and length were too short then i tried the small regular and i swam in that one way too much fabric the i tried the xs and it fit perfectly it does stretch around the bust line so wearing a red bra would look tacky as you can see through the lighter fabric but black or nude is fine or even a slip or a tank would cure that is,1
5472,This very lightweight and semisheer dress fits like a midi dress on my height the back hem ends low calf and the front hem is below knee straps are adjustable and bodice edge is elasticized the print is pretty and can pair with any sweater or jacket or jewelry or shoes that hits your fancy my concern is regarding the rayon fabric and how it will hold up after cleaning as all of my rayon clothing from random fast fashion retailer does not last long im and hap,1
5473,Love this chemise the lace detail is cute the length of the skirt is longer than many of the night gowns youd find in the cute not frumpy category and overall it is super soft and comfortable for lounging and sleeping bought the large and im normally around a size between medium and large depending on the cut of the item the large is slightly on the big size so the straps move around when i sleep not a big deal for me so i kept it,1
5474,I really wanted to love this waistcoat i purchased this online and tried it on as soon as i received itit runs large but i should have realized the horizontal stripes sitting on the hips is not a good thing the fur adds additional bulk where it is not needed the hip area i purchased a small and could have purchase a xs but i think the problem would still be there in a smaller size its going back but i am disappointed as i really wanted a something a little alternative,0
5475,I really love this dress i cannot believe how many people have complimented me on this dress and ask where i bought it the color is so soft and pretty the dress is comfortable as well it looks great with a light pair of wedges,1
5476,This top is beautiful soft and silky and hangs in a very flattering manner i am usually a but sized up to an to get a little more length it drapes really nicely i wear it with skinny jeans and a long necklaces for a casual puttogether look or it can be dressed up easily too im not sure what the previous reviewer meant about the neckline it lays perfectly on me highly recommend,1
5477,This is a nice shirt and very flattering the ivory is actually more of a tanbrown i would not call it ivory or off white the material has a nice texture to it as well it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing,1
5478,This is such a unique design and i love the colors i could be a small or xsmall and chose the xsmall fits perfectly,1
5479,This garment has the most beautiful and detailed embroidery on the front and across the top of the back i purchased this blouse in pale pink in a xs for my daughterinlaw who is an retailer fanatic i am sure she will look stunning in it my only negative would be the silver accent thread across the front is overkill,1
5480,Nice fit wish it was a little longer but i really do like it and feel good when i wear it,1
5481,Runs very large and way too much fabric i wanted this top to work because it looks cute on hanger i usually wear sm and the xs had too much fabric may work better on someone with longer torso and taller i am c lbs,0
5482,The print on the fabric of this dress is stunning it is lighter weight than i anticipated and the photo didnt show the keyhole opening in the front which i like but may not be for everyone i am pear shaped and on the tall side so the shape works nicely on me not too snug in the middle or rear not sure about someone not as tall or more busty i typically wear a larger size on the bottom than the top so i ordered in the larger size which fit well,1
5483,I absolutely love this top i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly fitted and flattering,1
5484,These are the best leggings they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed i didnt want to take them off im hoping to get a few more pairs,1
5485,I am obsessed with this top it is even more gorgeous in person a real showstopper,1
5486,I love the look of peplum tops i think they are very forgiving and they do a fantastic job of hiding my residual baby weight while still allowing me to look like i have an amazing figure not washed out figure i have several peplum tops but most of them are made out of a thicker fabric and they dont have much movability i absolutely love this one because it is a more casual design and much more comfortable than i am used to while still keeping the integrity of the peplum design the fabri,1
5487,This is a charming sweatshirt top with extra details to make it stand out the front panel has lovely art nouveau style embroidery and cut outs im going to enjoy wearing this with jeans it looks great with gray or black denim the colors are fabulous for someone with spring coloring the front panel is a very pale peach peche im lbs with small shoulders and c chest im typically a size or size xss and ordered an xs it fits well a little tighter than on the model,1
5488,I saw this in an email and loved it but by the time i tried to order it that evening some sizes were already gone the medium was backordered but didnt have to wait too long to receive it i especially like the design with the full skirt the material is light weight which is prefect for my florida climate the design and fit were beautiful i love it and will get years of use out of it my only complaint is the material wrinkles very easily i tried to get them out myself but ended up se,1
5489,The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering classic and comfortable the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile could be worn yearround so long as its not degrees out there is a bit of weight to it its one of my favorite pieces in my closet can be styled different ways pair with a higherend tee tank denim jacket or bodyhugging sweater i sized down,1
5490,I saw this in store but they didnt have my size and i balked at the price however i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think its well worth it the quality is very nice and it fits tts i like that the arm materials is stretchy ive worn this with jeans but will also wear it with a skirt to the office its got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things,1
5491,I have been struggling to find a nice flowy summer dress that isnt too short i am petite but do not like to wear my dresses too far above the knee so i ordered this in the regular this dress was not what i expected it is not flowy but rather a heavy and stiff fabric it is also way too wide it looks like it cant decide whether to be a box or a bag it is also shorter than advertised last thing to disappoint was the color darker and more muted than the photo on the website i cant,0
5492,So many compliments and so comfortableall i want from a pair of pants i am and around and a little bit of a pear and these fit perfectly in size l they felt a little tight at first and then stretched to be ideal i bought black and really love the softness the rise and the way they go with everything thinking of going back for one in the dark red this will be a winter staple to dress up or down i just hope they dont wear out too quickly,1
5493,I am lbs pearshaped i ordered the s and it fit perfectly just skimming the floor the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbetinspired colors the waistband is elasticized but not elastic and there is no unflattering poofing which can happen with skirts like this the flaw however is in the decision to only halfline this skirt with an offwhite jersey material the halflining isnt horrible but i found it,0
5494,The sleeves are fitted which i love works with a belt or without,1
5495,This tee is super soft and thin perfect for hot humid days i went with the neutral version and it is adorable with chino shorts or jean shorts i found it ran big i purchased in xs and still pretty baggy,1

5498,I was monitoring this sweater dress online for quite some time hoping it goes on sale but as soon as i saw the lighter color sell out i decided to grab the blue version before it runs out as well its a simple yet comfortably beautiful dress at the same time it looks about the same as it does on the model colorfit only in the neck is a little wider with bordered collar which makes it more interesting im ft tall lb ordered a large and i felt the dress was a bit oversized but with tha,1
5499,Very comfortable shirt washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats cute detail of colored thread on buttons just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting no button placket chest gapping,1
5500,This is my first demin jacket ever as all the ones i ever tried were too stiff and far too boxy and long on me i need to thank all the reviewers who helped me take the plungegot the size xs regular which is only slightly snug at bust when buttoned and a tiny bit long in the arm for me currently with narrow shoulders and torso very flattering look if this jacket comes out in a new darker wash version i will definitely also try a petite size sthe one i got in the mail,1
5501,im tall lbs and and the size s fit me perfectly the hyphen chino is my favorite pant just stretchy enough just casual enough without being sloppy just nice enough to wear to work i bought both pinks and the moss the turquoise were too big in the waist for some reason but the color while gorgeous didnt work with the rest of my wardrobe,1
5502,For once the dress looks better on me than on the model mine is tight above the bow and blackgrey my bow isnt this bignot pulled so much and maybe its not knotted in the photo its heavy canvas and doesnt show my flaws im saving it for summercant imagine wearing it as a jumper as in the photofor me e lbs the bust is slightly tight in a but the shoulders are a bit wide in an but both look good mine is not petite and hits me above the knee the dress is co,1
5503,This floral tank looks so cute on the layered cut is very flattering and ive received several compliments while wearing it adorable,1
5504,I love this jumper im and the p fit beautifully i needed no alterations i found it true to size i can see that if my torso was any longer it wouldnt fit though i found the quality of the fabric was nice it just gathers slightly but you can see that on the model too in the photo that doesnt bother me,1
5505,Retailer rarely disappoints and this jumpsuit is a perfect example i ordered a small based on reviews that it runs large and i do not like tight shorts and it was the right decision the fabric design and overall style make this piece easy to dress up or down i cant wait to wear it if you are on the fence order it now because this will not last long,1
5506,This is a wonderful style,1
5507,I love tracy reese this skirt did not disappoint i saw it originally in store fell in love i waited to see if it would go on sale and it didi put on the size it fit gorgeously the fabric is a bit stiff and bulky but i think thats so it holds its shape first thing i went into my living room began twirling aroundi am lbs athletic build the sizing is true to tracy reese ill need to get the skirt hemmed as its quite long on me but this little gem will be worn,1
5508,I loved the style when i saw it online and even more in person the fabric is light but not too light it has a nice drape i didnt expect easy to wear and style the draw string gives it a great shape but a belt is a great addition for more interest the length is fantastic as well wonderful midi length but with the side slits,1
5509,The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it very disappointing since i love the design im actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that its come to that,0
5510,The material was thin showed every lump youd rather hide and clung to the body even the sleeves were tight looked inexpensive,0
5511,I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside i really like this swingy top i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so im wearing a cami underneath maybe being taller helps it not seem so much like a tent well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo i used a coupon so help easy the pain of the price of this top,1
5512,This dress was hard for me to get on but once i didmy oh my i am quite top heavy including my upper arms and back so forcing the waistband over my shoulders made me panic a bit after the struggle it fits like a glove and skims over all my yucky parts cant stop caressing the fabric and i hope my date aka the hubs feels the same dress is not lined i wouldve liked a soft mesh type lining similar to what plenty uses petite was sold out so i bought medium regular and it skims the,1
5513,Bought these over the weekend and i am in love they are very soft extremely flattering and the rich green color is fantastic i may go back for the black i went with my usual size for reference and the fit is great these will be a fall staple for sure,1
5514,I adore a well made and well fit tshirt tla always delivers this one is no exception fun swingy and light the tie on back is a fun little addition and the length is perfect im and always prefer longer tops the swing in this one gives it a great length love the colors but decided to stick with basic white id love this in black too highly recommend,1
5515,Absolutely beautiful dress i bought a size and found it tts i typically buy in retailer dresses the print is gorgeous i am a sucker for anything with poppies and i love the silky material hugs your curves and flows nicely i was worried the torso would be too long based on prior reviews and because i am of short torso but it fits well would definitely recommend,1
5516,I was desperate to find a dress for an upcoming wedding i basically tired on every dress in the store this one was by far the best dress i tried on the outer layer is delicate and has great stitching and embroidery the only problem is that the slip is skin tight and too small this dress is so awesome im willing to overlook that and find my own slip when i came out of the dressing room another couple stopped to tell me how amazing the dress looked this dress is beautiful,1

5551,I was so excited to receive this jumpsuit as it looks so elegant and i love the lattice back as soon as it arrived i set about unbuttoning it to try it on minutes and broken fingernails later i got done when i tried it on i found that it fit everywhere except the bust which was much too tight and i am not a busty person so back it goes even if it had fit i do not think i could have handled the hassle of those buttons why they didnt design it with a hidden zipper on the side and kept,0

5556,I am short waisted and generally a petite on the top so a lot of these sweater vest toppers i find to be too long in the torso for me this one however is the perfect exception it is soft but with some structure comfortable and not too hot for warmer weather climates during the spring i bought it in seattle though i live in dallas and found it to be a perfect layering piece with a white tshirt and a jean jacket while walking around the rainy city fyi short waist broad,1
5557,These are literally the most comfortable and the softest jeans i have ever owned i just got them a few weeks ago and im already obsessed with them they have the perfect amount of stretch that makes them flattering and comfortable but they dont stretch out like all my other jeans do i ordered my usual size and they fit great cant recommend these enough,1
5558,I bought this when it first came back a number of years ago and loved it because it is great for travel it actually can be kind of a blanket when you are on airplanes that tend to be cold and it is so hard now to get a blanket it is also great coat for me as i live in southern california and it is not too heavy but does help the evening chill i went on a trip with this a few months after i originally bought it and i accidentally lef at the hotel i was staying at i am so glad it is back so th,1
5559,Love this denim jacket also have it in white the reason i didnt give it stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much none on the back which is kind of strange id love it even more if it wasnt distressed at all then it could be dressed up much more for work but overall its my favorite great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy please make this in some other denim colors,1
5560,Love this top purchased it in the coral color now im definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather im sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great fit true to size,1
5561,I am not really a fan of jumpsuitsrompersetc but i love this jumpsuit very good quality and design fits well but i thought the was pretty large for a i mean i probably should have gotten a which was sold out but i dont usually have to get a tailored i did in this case but it was still worth it,1
5562,When i saw this skirt on line i wasnt impressedespecially at the price but then i saw it in the store and i had to have it its beautiful definitely a colder weather skirt due to the nice weight of the fabric the colors are lovely and subtle with a little sheen ensuring you can wear it with many tops and for many occasions from everyday to dressier length is just at the bottom of the knee for me with a flattering and comfortable cut,1
5563,This top is so unbelievably cute the fit is perfect and it goes with just about anything on the bottom i personally styled mine with high waisted distressed skinny jeans and it looks adorable its a tiny bit seethru so you do need to wear a tank under it,1
5564,I love love this top it is so pretty i am stopped by strangers complimenting me on it it is so flattering i wear a cami under it and find it perfect it hits at the perfect length below the waist on my jeans its easy to throw on and go casual but dressy the sleeves do bell out so you may need to watch them when you eat ive accidentally caught them on my plate the shirts washes well,1
5565,I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer after striking out on several items i thought would work i grabbed this sweater in the cream color i loved it as soon as i put it on it is meant to be oversized which i love the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck looks great with skinny jeans and booties i went with my usual xs great purchase,1
5566,This dress had beautiful details and the material was better than i expected however it was huge it completed swallowed me i am about pounds with quite a bit of muscle i ordered a p and it still looked like a sack,0

5572,I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly it is a sweater dress which is not easily noticable in the web photos and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office,1
5573,I purchased these pants once i saw them go on sale i had seen them a little while back but with summer coming to an end i didnt want to spend for a pant a wouldnt wear often the plus off is a great price they are really cute and just as pictured good quality too however they were at least inches too long i am lbs and ordered the xs like i always do they fit perfectly except for the length worth the to get hemmed,1

5580,I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo it looks quite bland as it doesnt really flatter the model however once i saw this dress instore i was drawn to it immediately the dress is well made the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it,1

5596,I bought these on sale and they quickly went back i was very disappointed after reading the reviews i thought for sure these would be a winner however i was sadly mistaken i ordered another pair of jeans the same from a different brand these were way too small while my others were too large they didnt live up to my expectation and were still rather long even though i bought these on sale i was not happy with the quality,0
5597,Stunning i got about compliments the day i wore it different men i barely know said youre really rocking that outfit i wish they made this in petite as the xs is slightly big im lbs but i kept it anyway since im both a little underweight right now and also since i was able to roll the top so that it was an appropriate length to wear with flats i paired with a denim shirt perfection,1
5598,This is truly unique top the detail around the neck is a nice change,1
5599,I bought this in an extra small at a store in the lilac color and loved it so much i ordered a white one online days later they were out of extra sm so i ordered a small which is still ok as it looks cute being on the big flowy side with my jeans i normally wear a medium in tops ive received many compliments on these they are very figure flattering and its nice they are a little sexy for a loose top because of the open shoulders i hope they come out with more colors for summer because,1
5600,I love this thing i bought it yesterday and already am wearing it today and i have been known to leave things sitting around in my closet for awhile before i wear them especially if they arent a sure thing for reference i am a curvy busty size i bought an xl but a l would have worked too it has a drawstring on the inside back and on the bottom center back hem so it can be adjusted for more shape through the waist it has a beautiful drape is very soft and the embroidery makes it s,1

5602,I bought this dress to wear to a rehearsal dinner like other reviewers have said it is a true shift dress im lbs and the fit me like a glove it was a little hard to get the top on because the bow is not detachable wish there was a snap or something but once on i was in love i may have to safety pin my bra to the bow so it doesnt show because it kept showing when i tried on overall a very beautiful dress,1
5603,I saw this in the store and purchased it right on the spot didnt even see the reviews until now i can wear either a small or xsmall in retailer but for this top the xsmall was a better fit as it draped nicely and was still very loose on me im lbs b i was worried that the opening was too wide but it was perfect i like the elbow length sleeves and the fact that the blouse is lined which mean its not sheer and dont have to wear a camisole i usually stick with the classics i,1
5604,I feel in love with this shirt online and purchased it right away this is one of the those pieces that makes retailer my favorite place to shop stylish unique and beautiful it is a bit full in the bottom so i sized down from my normal s to xs and am very pleased,1

5614,Love the look of this and the fabric but runs way small i usually wear a ordered the then just got the and its still too small will be returning all,0
5615,I though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve its not first of all it runs very large i purchased a small i am usually a xs or small in maeve i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress the shoulders were very wide you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it didnt lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless i really wanted this dress to work i love,0
5616,Beautiful colors especially the pink i am and about lb i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs not only is it short hemwise which i dont really mind but it is short in the waist very pretty and good fabric,1
5617,This dress is gorgeous i absolutely love the embroidery a note about the sizing while the top portion fits snugly the hip section runs slightly big i was surprised to find that the i ordered looked baggy so i went into the store to try a but the was the best fit however im smallchested and lbs so i was able to go with the as it fit the hips much better if youre a bustier type though the top may be tight other than the tricky sizing its perfect,1
5618,This coat is truly gorgeous in person its an investment coat one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely i found it to be very high quality in fact i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it but i dont plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a nonissue for me the lining is one of the best parts of the coat show it off i think the problem,1
5619,This top is super flattering and comfortable perfect summer wear,1
5620,With all of the glowing reviews of this dress i so badly wanted to adore this very special cocktail dress it fit nicely the quality was great but there is a decorative line of hook and eyes down the front which come undone with the slightest movement i wore the dress out one time and was paranoid the entire time kept glancing down to make sure i hadnt come undressed i suppose i couldve gotten out the needlenose and crimped them all shut but decided to take it back i didnt see tha,0
5621,I bought this blouse at the store today and i love it they stylist brought it for me to try on with the green chinos and it was perfect it will go with jeans or dark pants as well very unique and flattering i got a size im and pounds,1
5622,This top is just darling the body of the top is lightweight sweatshirt type material thats dyed to appear well used the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured great to wear with leggings the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered extremely comfortable machine washable an unexpectedly nicer than it looks online garment i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl,1
5623,This is a beautiful sweater warm looks great with jeans as well as more formal work clothes the neckline gives it a stylish boho twist beyond the traditional i love the color and it can function almost like a neutral complimenting almost any other hues highly recommended,1
5624,This jacket is perfect swings just the right amount without looking too big,1
5625,Love this shirt the print is a little loud but cute i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy however that was a mistake with this shirt there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size i did like it enough to order again in the correct size l i am a size and busty if that helps the red is shortsleeved by the way if ordered online cute and flattering,1
5626,I ordered both the green and the pink and needed the extra extra small petite in the shirt to make it work for me nice light material cute fit unfortunately didnt like the pink color was too bright for me and although i ordered an extra extra small petite they sent me an extra small petite which is just slightly too big and saw the mango in the store which i also didnt like the color,1
5627,I really wanted to like this dress but where the skirt meets the top of the dress in the back creates sort of a hunchback effect in the back will be returning,0
5628,Amazing color true to picture it runs a bit large even with layering underneath im usually a l d in tops and i needed the medium for a nice fit im longish in the torso and this sweater fits just slightly cropped so really perfect with a longer button down underneath the buttons on the back are a nice detail,1
5629,They make your butt look great very whimsical design,1
5630,This shirt is so comfortable and flattering the quality is really good but i would definitely size down its not too heavy and can be worn with skinny jeansjeggings,1
5631,The color is more like bluishgreen very elegant its very soft and feels great on skin i love the buttons on the back its such a great touch and brings this sweater to a whole new level i usually wear xs but because im going to wear this sweater with a button up shirt underneath i ordered s great investment love to have it in my closet,1
5632,I thought that this dress would be perfect for my th birthday however i was disappointed when i received it it is extremely heavy from the beading and i just did not find it pretty in person it did nothing for me also it runs small and was tight,0
5633,I bought this dress for a couple fall weddings to hide my postpartum belly it was only available in a size which is my typical size i was nervous based on the reviews it would still be too big but it fits perfectly i am so i assume my frame can handle the drappiness well,1
5634,Ive admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room much to my delight im generally a sale shopper so this doesnt mean i didnt think it was priced well i have the oatmeal top with yellowgoldorange pattern on the skirt in xs the small fits comfortably up top but on my petite frame the top just looked too big so i went with xs i suppose the straps are a bit confusing but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin,1
5635,I bought this bc it looked exactly my style and i was right ive worn this once and it is so comfortable and the fit is great i can see this being a shirt i wear again and again all summer i bought the black and am thinking about buying the peachyplaid color,1
5636,This dress is so beautiful in person it is not overly flowy well made and extremely feminine i really have not a bad word to say about it and on sale its a steal i plan to wear mine with tall boots as shown and with my cowboy boots,1
5637,I loved this top even more in person it is made well and beatiful the sheer under layer adds a sexyness to the design the back of the shirt is open i really like this detail,1
5638,The jeans are flatering and stylish they are slightly distressed but will go with anything the fit is like other pilcro stet pants ive purchased and loved,1
5639,I was hesitant to try this duster vest because im on the shorter side i was very pleasantly surprised when i tried it on and love it i ordered a xs petite and yes it is long as it is supposed to be but fitted enough that it looks very cute paired with skinny jeans and boots the fleece lining was substantial and the outer wool was very soft definitely a keeper,1
5640,Im taking this to hawaii for the holidays im wearing it with black calf length tights and a black belt it is fine without tights i just like that look it is a really great dress,1
5641,Awesome shirtgreat transition into fall somewhat sheer extremely comfortable,1
5642,This was a christmas gift to my sister she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it very cute design lovely deep red color only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry may run a bit large but the medium for her well slightly loose fitting garment she is and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt,1
5643,This shirt runs gigantic and its not even cute im done buying retailer online,0
5644,Just like in picture super cute and comfortable sweater,1
5645,I love my very old pilcro stet jeans they are the perfect denim weight and the back pockets are set in a way that is very flattering for the tush not so with the newer pilcros unfortunately the denim is thinner and may have more stretch and they get worn and pill on my inner thighs and the back pockets are set far apart making my back side look unnaturally wide its a bummer,0
5646,I loved this top so much i ended up buying both of the designs they are so cute and eye catching and the layered look is really fun it fit me very well,1
5647,I saw this top online and ordered immediatelyi loved the color lace and unique detailssadly it just arrived and it is a disasterthe lace is stiff and doesnt lay softly and is very rough against your skinthe style and i like shorter style tops is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny waythat although i am so in love with this color i would be embarrassed to wear this top in publicit could have been fantastic if the lace was softer and some a,0
5648,I purchased this about a month ago and its a great piece it goes with just about everything from dresses to jeans and a long sleeve tshirt i love how it drapes around the front and the material is very soft its a great piece for fall weather that will be a keeper in my closet,1
5649,This velvet maxi dress is what fall dreams are made of it fits very true to size and is the perfect length about to ankles the material is soft and had so much subtle details in it gorgeous once the weather cools a bit it will also pair nicely with tall boots and an undershirt i plan on rocking this all fall and winter,1
5650,Im really glad i read the previous reviews on this im normally between a or thought a would work best for me seeing that its high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys the fits very comfortably im and i can wear them with flats,1
5651,A fabulous light weight jacket love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels a keeper i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets for reference dd and pounds and height,1
5652,I love this fauxfur coat i wear it both dressed up down i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long im happy i did for reference the faux is soft comfy its warm but not blizzard warm i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it where did you get thatdefinitely worth the purchase on sale,1
5653,I love this top fits perfectly and not too long im lbs and a dd and the small fits like a gemnot too fitted but not boxy i like that it covers my waist but isnt too long either i may order another one i love it so much,1
5654,On me thsi was ginormous looked like a mu mu it is pretty but there was just too much fabric even in the smallest size the quality seems nice and it looks pretty but overwhelming i will say i think it would work on tail lean people i have pretty muscular shoulders so the off shoulder look with that much fabric made me look pounds heavier no joke fabric is soft though give it a try just not for meref lbs dd in waist,0
5655,So i bought these pants in midseptember while at a local retailer store i thought they were a bit short but the salesgirl assured me they were fine wore them soon after and then discovered they came in tall sizes as well anyway one they came on sale i rebought them nabbing the last tall in my size while that is a testament for how much i love them the fit is true to size other than the length issue i am with long legs the t fit me perfectly of course they cost me more than th,1
5656,I tried on a dressing room full of items before christmas and this was the clear winner i got it in the green xs which fit perfectly i am and of medium build the s was slightly too big through the chest and arms skewed a little too military looking for me i like the versatility of leaving it open or zipping it up but like another reviewer i wish the top lapel would snap back onto the shoulder because it can flop back and that gets a little annoying overall i really like the fitt,1
5657,Really like this top fun flair nice quality shirt great for dressing up with skirt and also would be perfect with boots for the rodeo i paired it with a skirt and boots for church wore white cami under to emphasize lace details super cute tried and p thought petite was too short in length on me will send petite back,1
5658,I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadnt found any that caught my eye leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style,1
5659,This dress is very sweet and summery i disagree with all the other reviewers who complain about their not being enough room in the chest i wear a double d and i didnt notice any pulling which is definitely a problem ive experienced in other button down dresses i also appreciated that the straps were wide enough to cover a bra though i definitely will have to have them shortened the color is not particularly vibrant kind of a soft yellow thoat might not be flattering on every skin tone,1
5660,These are true to size and photo i wore them to the opera and cant wait to wear them with sandals and a tee this summer,1
5661,Love this dress perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit not too long not too short i got so many compliments with this dress,1
5662,The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big looks great on the model but awful on me,0
5663,This is truly a lovely dress the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figurein my opinion if fits true to size im b and lbs and i got it in a p which is the size i normally get in dresses it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being,1
5664,This is a great top and got compliments alreadyit does have a longer sleeve like the picture butreally not bad its so comfortable and color is fabulous great with any scarf too,1
5665,I am and pounds slender but with a tummy the small fit great and i agree with the other reviewer that the elastic waist band is complimentary the dress flounces out a little but in a cute way and its not too short compared to so many other baby doll dresses out there now i didnt think it looked that great on the hanger but when i tried it on it looked so much better than i expected got the brown thank you to the other reviewers for the bootie boot moto jacket transition to,1
5666,This is not something i would normal wear but the beauty of the fabric made just give it a try i am so glad i did the fit is beautiful slimming feminine fit with just enough flow i love it and bought it right away you better get it before its gone also it is true to size i have along torso so sometimes i have issues with jumpers but not this one,1
5667,I have already worn this several times it is very flattering lightweight and easy to wear dressy but also very soft and comfortable,1
5668,I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft i usually wear an xs or s in retailers clothing so i tried on the xss and felt it was true to size its obviously large but thats because that is the style the shoulders fell perfectly i was in love from the moment i put it on while its not my normal style it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of cozying up in colder weather by wrappi,1
5669,I found this in my local atl store that carries petites before seeing it online the materials is lovely and silky with a full lining the top lace detailing is a nice touch and will make the dress stand out under jackets or sweaters for cool weather this is great with any shoe type very versatile year round piece alone or under layers should be good for all body types,1
5670,This top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking i cant wait to wear it it will look great with skinny jeans,1
5671,Thicker than you thinkthe colors are gorgeous and remind you of the changing of the seasons can not wait to wear when the weather gets cooler retailer did not disappoint plan to purchase in other color soon,1
5672,If you love the boho style then this too is for you it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans leggings sandals boots and booties i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws for reference im and bought the pm but needed the ps i have recievied tons of compliments and im thinking of getting the silver one too,1
5673,I absolutely love this product it is so versatile and i can wear it up or dress it down absolutely perfect paired with leggings to sit in classes all day,1
5674,Very flattering cut only con is that is seems to snag easily extremely comfortable and dont need to wear a cami under it like i originally thought i would,1
5675,Just bought these today and they are super soft and beautiful also cotton yay i hate poly thought i should mention though that they do shrink in the dryer so unless youre skinny you might want to buy a size up or hang them to dry and then put in the dryer on low to fluff,1
5676,Great top can be dressed up or down the lace is great quality and i love the border detailing i found this shirt to run pretty true to size,1
5677,I love this shirt it is very soft and has a nice cut and drape fits true to size wish there were more colors,1
5678,Love this shirt so comfortable and the style is really flattering,1
5679,This top is really a great and its very affordable the fabric is light weight but opaque enough that you dont need a cami even though this has long sleeves i can imagine wearing this well into the summer and i live in south florida its comfortable and the band at the bottom is not tight the color is slightly ivory and the floral print is clear and bright the neck tie is really nice and adds a s vibe without being overdone or overly dramatic definite keeper,1
5680,This suit is absolutely gorgeous but it really will only fit a very short waisted gal it fit perfectly in the body and in the bust but just was not long enough for me to lift my arms up and my size c cup boobs to not pop out i was very sad to return it i am a size with c cup boobs and ordered it in a medium,0
5681,I just love these i ordered these in both the lighter and darker denim in my usual size they fit just right just like my other pilcro jeans im only and the petite version was not available so i will have to get them altered but thats typical i love the wash in each of them and the distressing is good not overthetop im so glad i got these and the sale price was a bonus,1
5682,I love everything about this except the length i am short and usually order a petite and even this is really cropped on me the quality is good thick and substantial color is great but very cropped and sleeves are long on me as well just weird proportions so sadly going back,0
5683,Just gorgeous the dress makes a nice transition piece for early fall perfect in every way,1
5684,I absolutely love this romper the chambray material is super comfy and easy to wear i ordered a size up l and im happy i did bc it would have been a little too tight in the arm area to squeeze into and gave a little extra wiggle room in the belly area for reference i usually wear size m and im a c,1
5685,I have worn this beautiful and super comfy top a number of times since i purchased it it can be casual or add a long necklace and dress it up super versatile,1
5686,Maeve is hands down my favorite clothing brand so i am a little biased but this is just the cutest top i saw so many pics of this top in the gallery that i had to have it i waited for it to go on sale and ordered it in my usual size which normally is perfect in maeve tops this is just a little snug in the shoulders but not enough to send back for an exchange if your on the fence go for it,1
5687,I have shirts and dresses from this brand and they are great i was happy to finally see a pair of pants these are just as soft and well made as the other items i would recommend you try them on there is only a slight variation from one size to the next so it will depend on what look you are going for they are cropped at the calf but can be pulled up for a more dressier look i cannot say enough about the material it is so soft and comfortable they do wonders for your behind i think,1
5688,Im lbs wear size or normally and small or extra small b bra i tried on size and it fit great this dress rocks i live the soft material and side pockets not a lover of a line skirts but this one is subtle i do need a strapless bra but if you are more endowed than me you wont need it the hem is unseamed leaving it a bit edgy since the denium is light i can wear ghis dress now and into summer i live in texas so probabley wont be wearing it after june covering my,1
5689,The embroidery details on this top are beautiful the material is soft and a really good quality my first time wearing out and i received so many compliments i love it,1
5690,Ive been looking for a leatherfaux leather jacket for ages and this one is perfect its just a tiny bit edgy but more feminine than most leather jackets which is exactly what i was looking for i typically wear xs but after reading the reviews for this jacket that said it runs small i ordered both a small and xs to try on the small was way too big and the xs fit perfectly it can be worn over a light layer or over a chunky sweater very comfortably without the arms getting tight i th,1
5691,It took a minute but once i figured out how to wear this i loved it it is meant to be oversized and for me looks best with leggings and ankle boots too much bulk to be worn with even a slim skirt im curvy and long limbed the fabric has a thick high quality feel i find it quite soft and comfy the unexpected design of the ribbing gives it a subtle chic its fashion forward without trying too hard the cowl is really closer to a boatneck with an extra fold which works well for,1
5692,So cute rompers are hard because they are so cute but rarely work for all body types this one is so super cute the material is so soft and comfy feels silky i got a small and fits perfect im and lbs so it runs very true to size when most clothes from retailer run big i love rompers but only have one other one this is by far my favorite i cant wait until its much warmer and i can wear it all the time,1
5693,This is my first pair of ag and i love them so far they are not cuffed as shown in the picture they are long so i had to get them altered im the color is a rich blue and they have a nice stretch i havent worn them all day yet to see if they keep their shape usually a or and went with the on these got them on perc off sale so very happy,1
5694,This shirt is unflattering and boxy it does not look cute at all on me i am returning,0
5695,I tried this on at my local store i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it alas it was not to be the material is super thin almost seethrough and it is of poor quality i did not buy it,0
5696,These crops are very well proportioned and fun the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants optionsi am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have i usually need to order cropped pants in tall but these worked with the regular inseam,1
5697,Loved the chocolate ones so much i went back for the rose my first thought when i tried them on was i could live in these honestly a very comfortable pant,1
5698,This top is fun loose but still flattering the colors are nice and the fabric soft can fit well lbs dd,1
5699,This skirt is wonderful the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal but the quality is impeccable i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt it can be dressed up dressed down worn during all seasons the designpattern is artsy and whimsical without being too outthere unless you want it to be of course the fit is true to size and the delicate details are just lovely,1
5700,I tried on the xs in store in crimson i would need petite the color and fit were very flattering on me pale skin the dress feels very silky i love the back how it ties and how high the neckline was on me in the front the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work reference lbs dd in waist,1
5701,Not sure im keeping this i love it but its short in the waist im and very tight in the top im on the small side of a size normally a sometimes but the in this is very tight i do have broad shoulders but am thin at pounds so not sure if its just me or if the dress is truly smallish it is lovely and i want to keep it will try it on again tomorrow and decide if you are on the large end of any size do size up,1
5702,I mentioned the sizing is true to size but it should be important to note that they will loosen throughout the day so when i order another color i will size down one size the color is as pictured too these are great for casual and business casual wear so comfortable and perfect and flattering for my shape athletic with muscular thighscant wait to order another pair,1
5703,Yikes there is a whole lot of skirt here i am weigh around lb and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing depending on the designer this skirt balloons out from the waist on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking the skirt is very long hitting way below midcalf there is also tons of material creating a parachute effect definitely returning,0
5704,This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable yet cute i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique yet whimsical swimsuit style,1
5705,Upon entering a local retailer store i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on fyi c broad shouldersback high waist almost and i normally wear a in a fitted buttonup shirt i can go down to a in a loosefit one but with the buttons i wouldnt expect this to be loosefitting i wear a m or l in a knit top i tried this on in but it was too big in the armholes and chest causing the top to stand out too much from my body when i tried on the these,1
5706,Love the print so much it is a bit boxy but for the length i needed to size up to a s from my usual xs with my long torso at lbs im thinking that sizing up will also save me from any potential dryer accidents but it doesnt really matter what size you getjust get it for the cute print scene,1
5707,Very comfortable love the builtin lining it fits loosely but i dont like anything binding so it works for me length is fine i could easily wear it to work,1
5708,Very pretty dress the blue is a little lighter than navy but is still really nice the embroidered flowers are lovely as well the aline cut is very flattering on i cant wait to wear this dress this spring,1
5709,This vest is so functional i think it is much prettier in person than in this photo it has a much softer look to it and is less orange more tan ive worn it with a lot of different things over a sweater dress at work with soft pants and a longsleeve tshirt or skinny jeanspants and a simple top wish it came in other colors gray navy or green would all be amazingone of my favorite pieces this season for sure i do think it runs a little bit large but i think the next size smaller,1
5710,This is the perfect tank its super soft great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra best of all it was offered in petitie sizes for me that means i finally have a tank that doesnt gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank,1
5711,The wash on these jeans made my hips look twice as big that in combination with the looser boyfriend cut was not flattering quality was excellent denim was thick with the right amount of stretch unfortunately they had to go back,0
5712,The material this top is made of is extremely comfortable and flattering for my body type i normally wear and fit great if you have a d or bigger you may need a bigger size spillage is possible with wrong size lol,1
5713,These jeans are perfectexactly what i was looking for i was afraid the rise might be too high but it was just right well below the belly button i abhor anything resembling a mom jean rise they will look really chic with boots as well as sandals or flats i have lots of pants in my wardrobe but i have a feeling this will be a favorite pair,1
5714,This top really is lovely i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans i wash everything before i wear it though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned so i hand washed it with delicate soap when the lighter colors came into contact with the black the black immediately stained the light color i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains rinsed and hung it above my bath tub it is cur,0
5715,I love this dress great fit and quality love that the skirt is lined this is a real throw on and go piece ive worn it with wedges and with espadrille sneakers my only complaint is that the sturdy material makes it difficult to get the tie waist to lay down flat but overall an amazing dress,1
5716,Just buy this dress the slip the hem the print everything about it,1
5717,Extremely disappointed with this top it runs extremely large im lbs c and usually wear between a xss tops at retailer i ordered a and it looked like a maternity top on me the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all fabric was also a gauzelike material that was not soft unfortunately i will be returning,0
5718,I just bought this dress and love the fit im pear shaped and its very flattering its not clingy because it is lined and it has great drape its also seasonless it will look great with boots and a sweater or kimono,1
5719,Love this top im athletic its a little tight around the arms but its a really nice looking blouse off and on,1
5720,Saw this top online and thought i would give it a try i am glad i did there is not a thing wrong with this top cute design nice weight fabricno cami needed underneath and it fits very well for reference i am lbs and c and of course it goes with literally every piece of clothing you would wear on the bottom half of your bodythis is a keeper,1
5721,Flowy boho tank great details good fabric wear under a long cardigan or with a pair of denim cut offs and a necklace oversized fit i would size down one size,1
5722,Note the sleeves on the model that is how your regular size will fit your arms however even if you have skinny arms like i do the sleeves will be tight i bought my regular size xs and it was clingy with an odd flair and the length seems as though i ordered a petite and i am only ft ini advise to try a few sizes on if you really are interested the red is truly a red which is a good thing because so often it is hard to find a red that is not neon,0
5723,Lovely small whale cords they fit too tight around the waist for me unfortunately i will have to return,1
5724,This dress was one of those incidental finds i saw instore while making an online return for whatever reason i didnt notice this one online but loved it in person the fit is easy going and flattering i took a small as the shoulder fit wouldve been a little tight in the xs great dress for transitioning seasons,1
5725,This jacket is gorgeous the design is visually very interesting the fabric is light enough that i can wear it to work and keep it on all day,1
5726,Okay so i have an upcoming day of travel with four kids a husband on crutches and a flight leaving at am for which i have to leave my house at am followed immediately by a le cirque show upon our arrival ive been looking for something to wear during this chaos and this is it the fabric is dreamysoft and the drape perfect yes it looks like a dress but i am happy for the conservative pantsjumpsuit it actually is the pockets hold my phone without sagging and i can wear sneakers du,1
5727,Not only was it love at first sight when i saw it online but i fell even more in love at first touch everything about this dress is perfection i got the black motif the colors are just lovely the weight feel of the dress are nice the length is great i added a skinny black belt for more waist definition but its cute with or without it i am more than pleased with this purchase,1
5728,These pants fit comfortably and are really nice on theyre not too bulky and can be worn in a casual way andor with a formal look i just wish black jeans didnt always have that odd rubber smell other than that these are great,1
5729,This blouse is gorgeous i purchased in two colors and absolutely love it just a side note i normally wear a size small blouse or size blouse in this i went up a size and purchased the medium,1
5730,I finally ordered this after looking at it many times had to order the p as they were out of all other petite sizes and to my surprise it totally fits me why i put larger both colors are equally nice but due to my pale skin and only petite available i ordered the yellow one brighter colors cut is flattering love the pleat detail in the skirt the p fit my dd chest and inch waist the length is perfect above the knee in front and lower in the back good choice,1
5731,I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft with suri a type of alpaca in the title i dont know if the blend polyamide royal baby alpaca fine merino threw it but had i felt this in store i would never have even picked it up unimpressed,0
5732,I ordered the orange plaid version in size it fit me like it does the model its true to size the peplum is very comfortable the plaid isnt seethrough so no extra layer of a tank is needed the neckline isnt too low very wellmade and a great choice for summer,1
5733,Very pretty design hugs the body correctly its a little tight in the chest for me im a c large c and i have some back chub so im using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months,1
5734,It was purchased as a gift but truly amazing the quality is fantastic and the owner of the sweater is truly happy with it,1
5735,Agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape unflattering overall i normally wear a size of and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare unlined and it itches,0
5736,I was originally looking for a denim skirt with a fit and flare shape i then saw this skirt and decided it was much more versatile than denim it is a mid weight skirt lined good lengthjust above the knee and the swingy shape is perfect i will wear it now with boots and a chunky sweater when it warms up flats and a short sleeve sweater will be cute i ordered a small but i really should have paid more attention to the other reviews because it does run large i ordered another one in e,1
5737,I wear med or large in most items the medium was huge fit like a moo moo size down by at least two,0
5738,Chic and comfortable even in degree heat so easy to wear,1
5739,I am in love with the pilcro brand this pair is gorgeous i love the how versatile these will be in my wardrobe i can dress them up with a nice blazer sweater or dress them down with tshirts or tanks these will be a staple in my wardrobe they are a nice navy blue,1
5740,This dress is made with stretchy cottony fabric yet very forgiving it fits like a glove but doesnt show bulges fit is perfect i had originally purchased the white and grey but the petite length is better too bad as i do love me some red oh well,1
5741,I purchased the raspberry color and it is beautiful even though the sweater is very long and covers your bottom it is surprisingly flattering great with the booties or boots and skinny jeans i am and purchased a size small which fits perfectly,1
5742,The picture doesnt do these justice they are beautiful and a musthave for summer date nights i am and hover between i tried on the regular size instore and they were way too long so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band not styled like the pic they literally feel like you are wearing nothing youll receive so many compliments trust me,1
5743,This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways the color is rich and classy,1
5744,This bunches up too much and the fabric is even more see through than i expected so even with a tank top under it its not a good look for work even unbuttoned at the top i could barely get this over my head this one is going back,0
5745,Just wanted to let readers know that the dress doesnt flare out at the bottom like it shows on the model for me thats a good thing it definitely sways and swishes but doesnt flare out you definitely have to wear a slip with it not because its seethrough at all its not but because of the static also this is the perfect dress for beltlovers,1
5746,Im with high waist and some booty this dress has a fantastic flattering fit i paired it with the elita belt as opposed to the thicker belt on the long waisted model love the belt too btw the fabric is soft and will pair well with tshirt or cami underneath i plan to wear with brown booties as well as sandals looking for a suede jacket now,1
5747,Love this top purchased for family photos and i think its great personally i dont think the model shot is doing it justice its much prettier in person runs true to size for retailer i am a d and i purchased a small,1
5748,This dress fits very nicely i didnt keep it as i have too many dresses but loved the fit hip was a little looser compared to the top you can almost see it on the model if you look closely the dies poke out a bit the teal color is very flattering on my pale skin tone love the back you can actually zip it all the way mid back with the tie in the neck leaving a nice cutout p fit me lbs in waist dd,1
5749,Most of my jeans are ag love the ankle length and wash on these not too distressed either tts really soft denim size like my other ags,1
5750,As cute in person as the picture shows good quality worth the money,1
5751,These are comfy and cool i got the blue which is more royal than navy in opinion it goes well with almost anything i can wear all the neutral colors in addition to orange red yellow and patterns they are flattering and like other reviewers i went up a size to in the blue perfect length not too short got the same version last year in white lbs,1
5752,I bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size when i reordered my normal size it was a pretty good fit i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where id hoped to wear it,1
5753,This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement im so happy that it went on sale definitely worth it,1
5754,I really love the colors of this top especially in the pinky pastels it fits really well can be tied or untied and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts speaking of that i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer am i hiding a pregnancy feel to it butthe price tag for a tank blouse is just too much for me i will save this one in my shopping bag and hope its still available once it goes on sa,1
5755,This is a really pretty top that you can dress up or down the draping on the neck and shoulders falls nicely and i love the back with the lace it is simple but unique and has nice classic lines i am usually a pxs but based on the measurements i went with the regular xxs and glad i did bc the petite would have been too short,1
5756,I bought this top in the black color and its great the lace sleeves are so soft not itchy at all and it is very flattering,1
5757,Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down wore it to work already and got so many compliments unfortunately when i saw it in store they didnt have it in stock the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size so he checked the stores that carried it i called one and the mailed it to me customer service in store is great,1
5758,Really cute stress i love the pattern and feel that this dress you can easily dress up or dress down the neckline is the main reason why i bought the dress it is a dress that hits above my knees so i like how modest it is the slightly open back is also a nice touch its a dress that can easily be dressed up or dressed down perfect spring dress,1
5759,I disagree with reviewers who said the dress looked cheap cavernous or stiff quite the opposite i wore this to my nd anniversary dinner and two women stopped me to say i was stunning i am an average medium hourglass the dress arrived in weeks and was true to size i wore a nude lace strapless bra underneath the hem reaches the bottom of my kneecaps the lace sleeves were not tight on my fleshy arms the neckline lays flat the dress zips in back and the silver hooks in front are most,1
5760,My new favorite dress very flattering beautiful color and great length fabric feels very good as well im usually sm purchased the medium and it fits perfectly,1
5761,This is such a great casual fall sweater its so comfortable has a bit of design too it and it goes with everything i bought it in the grey and love it fits a bit big,1
5762,I tried these on in the store in the small and needed to xs so i ordered them online they are perfect i wore them last night and got so many compliments for reference i am and lbs,1
5763,I love these pants bought them in both black and burgundy but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning they werent even tight so disappointing i will be returning them,0
5764,The color design and fabric of this top got it in the red were just as i expected but as the owner of several deletta brand tops i was very surprised to find that my usual size small runs very large in this tank not only did the front dip too low but so did the arm holes and the top just hangs on me it was so big for a small that it almost made me think it had been mislabeled and was really a size large bummed to return it because i really love the color and the style will try an xs,0
5765,I love everything about this vest comfortable and cute great transition piece into spring,1
5766,I love this i pair it with jeans or leggings and it works wonderfully its comfortable and stylish and a necessary addition to my wardrobe its a staple piece that i know ill be able to use for years,1
5767,I dont typically write bad reviews but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway my fault i know the dress is super stiff i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes im typically a and the size small swallowed me and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust i ordered both sizes to try i wouldnt recommend buying this if you are a size or small,0
5768,This beautiful blouse first caught my eye in the store i thought it was a bit pricey but couldnt keep thinking about it walked away without it then i went online and it had gone on sale i knew i had to have it the large fit perfectly i got so many compliments on the blouse i wore it with skinny jeans and little boots i couldnt be happier with this gorgeous blouse,1
5769,This is such a cute and different jacket of course i asked if they had it in black but i am glad they didnt because this is such a great color that is so versatile i use it as a topper when it is not that cold out with a short sleeve under it or a long sleeve fitted shirt you can wear with jeans or black pants if you want great material for the price as well i am usually between a small but more of a medium in my jackets i ordered this in xss and it has plenty of room to even wear a swea,1
5770,This screams the old school classic retailer that we all love it was one of my rare full price purchases because its just perfection im lbs and normally and xs however when i tried on an xs is store i felt that it sort of swallowed me up i went ahead and ordered an xs petite even though i rarely go with petites but it fits perfectly it doesnt leave room for layering but i live in socal so i dont need to layer often,1
5771,I am always a fan of retailer cardigans but this one exceeded my expectations the quality is a work of art especially the back and the color i chose the green is so unique and beautiful you will not be disappointed go for it,1
5772,These do run small for pilcro which i think runs large overall after reading other reviews i decided to get the size i would order in ag or coh and the like thanks fellow reviewers because im pleased when i first put them on i said no the waist was a tad big but comfy and the legs seemed tight with the slits at the bottom going right to my ankle inch inseam i thought these looked ridiculous however once i had them on for about minutes they just sort of molded to my body and loo,1
5773,I was a little bit afraid to purchase this because of the price but i am so glad i did because this is a gorgeous swimsuit the quality is amazing and the colors are exactly as pictured i have a smallish frame with a big bust and this style keeps my figure very flattering without making my chest look too big or heavy,1
5774,I didnt even notice this tee online but in person in the store i instantly loved it then trying it on loved it even more it is flattering without being too tight i got an xs which is my usual size im not a huge fan of the sleeve length in winter so i almost wish it had been either long or short sleeve but no biggie i still love,1
5775,I ordered this sweater online in a size xs and the order was cancelled because it was out of stock i ended up finding a sm at my local retailer and was so happy it worked just perfectly im usually an xs but the sm worked great it is a thick knit and may snag so im being careful with it simply meant to be,1
5776,I love this dress splurged while i was doing my christmas shopping to get this for myself and im so glad i did its such a comfortable dress stretchy and not too thin or too heavy of a fabric it pairs well with tights and a long cardigan in the winter or on its own with a statement necklace style and fit are great this dress is super flattering,1
5777,The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store they never had my size to try on so when a free shipping offer came up i ordered the ivory top in a size large well the sleeves are indeed stunning but that is all that is attractive about this top the rest was a plain blank white canvas in fact thats what it felt like to wear it like i was wearing a tent or an artists canvas on my chest yuck how can this designer put so much thought and care into t,0
5778,When i received this blouse ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky some of the fabric would stick to these dots i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid however after hanging on my closet door the dots are still sticky i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me,1
5779,After reading the glowing reviews i was excited to buy this on sale im tall and lean but found the dress looked slightly awkward and off on me compared to the model pictures firstly the top has a strange transition to the skirt with extra fabric you have to either blouse over the skirt or bunch together if you blouse it and lay flat it invariably gets bunched as you wear it this bunching changes the aesthetics of the color blocks creating less clean lines i also found the blue black,0
5780,I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did its a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect i like the length of the shirt,1
5781,But like other reviewers said it looks nothing like the picture of the model i am and lbs i usually wear an xs in maeve and i ordered the xs petite the straps are not adjustable so the top part of the dress is up too high and then there is just so much material it looks like im months pregnant and i usually love loose dresses like this but the way this falls really does make you look like you are hiding a sack of potatoes so bummed because the material is beautiful and i lo,0
5782,Bought one for myself and one for my mom we both love it super soft boxy and oversized but great for layering over a belted tunic,1
5783,I know the photos for this dress show it as a very casual dress but i find it very eleganti really love this dress it is very simple but that is what makes it stunning the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly it fits really nice on top my bra fits just fine underneath and doesnt show im a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite im fine with that nice quality fits well done deal for me,1
5784,I wanted these culottes to work so much the fabric is gorgeous but the size i ordered didnt fit im normally a size in pants and i ordered a size it was way too tight and made me look like i had a pooch in the zipper area not what i wanted it to be had to return them unfortunately,0
5785,I noticed this outfit earlier this year and remarked to my husband how heavenly it was i couldnt bring myself to buy it since i shy away from strapless outfits this lady is a small chested diva to my delight my wonderful husband remembered my gushing and surprised me with this outfit for christmas imagine a yearold dancing around the house holding up this outfit because that is what happened this outfit it truly a work of art it has a lined bodice with soft boning that fits perfe,1
5786,Picture definitely does not do this vest justice i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel i am lbs size and the small works for me the vest will work with ivory black grey and red underneath i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look there are small pockets in the front as well definitely worth the asking price,1
5787,This is such a pretty dress light and flowy i got it to wear on hot summer days,1
5788,I absolutely adore this top i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well its super soft and casual but still really cute its a little long im but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these,1
5789,Cool comfortable goes with everything i found both colors at my local antro today almost ordered the grey online because thats all that was available but decided to check my store first so glad i did the peach is so pretty and looks really good with my blond hair the grey looked much more like a faded black darker than pictured online imo i would have still purchased it in grey if thats all they had because it is such a great piece but the peach really is lovely im p,1
5790,This dress is gorgeous i tried it on in the store several weeks ago and loved it but the cost was a deterrent when it went on sale i ordered it immediately hoping it gets here soon the fit is wonderful length perfect embroidery just beautiful and quality is excellent it is versatile too easy to dress down with a sweater and boots and beautiful for a more formal event like a wedding for fit reference i am lb and ordered size this was the correct fit in the store exci,1
5791,The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy utility zipper hidden with snaps the zipper pull when closed sat right on my collarbone which was he height of discomfort it felt heavy and awkward the dress was very high waisted for me im and it was inches above the navel also to the point of discomfortan invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a nonpetite sizingthe fabric is quite beautifu,0
5792,I bought this shirt after reading so many positive reviews it looks much thinner and cheaper than the photo depicts like many reviewers have said it does hit just above midriff but the fringe covers your belly it didnt hang right on me and i felt like i was wearing a rug,0
5793,Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell not as cute as it looks in the photo returned,0
5794,Gorgeous blouse but a touch too large i may return and try a small,1
5795,Love the collar cut is cropped but im wearing a tank under for hole coverage anyways no complaints,1
5796,I received this as a gift and have seldom been so pleased with anything as another reviewer noted some retailer clothing looks darling and then falls apart not something acceptable at this price pointunlike her this was not one of those times ive worn this daily for weeks and feel like the buttons trim and weave could not be any better not only that but it looks terrific with everything the sweater has a flattering line that tapers at the waist even unbuttoned it is soft warm and cl,1
5797,This blouse is an all season winneri bought the taupe and can wear it with or without a cami under a sweater alone with skirts pants jeans i am and a medium was perfect although i normally wear a small,1
5798,The essence of femininity simply beautiful if you begin with the pattern of the dress you become drawn to it then as you look closer and see the slip with its creamy detailed embroidery and immediately you see how the dress opens at the bodice with tiny set buttons you soon realize thats not all the bottom of this fine piece of art continues with soft delicate chiffon trim with a bonus layer of the most beautiful lace to finish it off i bought it on sight and just love it i was,1
5799,dd in tops in bottomsthis is a wonderfully soft and warm sweater the pink color is heathered with some grey and goes with just about any neutral bottom the neckline was a little fiddly when i first tried it on however like one of the previous reviewers i folded the left side under a bit to make an asymmetrical cowl neck and it lays very nicely and looks great runs a little big i tried the medium and it fits perfectly another great sweater from moth,1
5800,So glad to see high waisted jeans again very soft very comfortable and the raw edge hem makes them just edgy enough,1
5801,I am loving this shirt i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not for me this is a great substitute for the cloth stone fringed plaid buttondown dress its definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a tshirt and this on top it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is highly recommend,1
5802,I debated whether or not to order this dress i love the cut and style but i was afraid the color would not work for me with dark hair and pale skin yellow tends to wash me out i was correct but the dress was adorable definitely size down i usually wear a medium or in retailer dresses but based on other reviews i ordered this in a small might could have used an extra small this dress certainly wont show off those pounds you lost but it is very comfortable and not overly boxy als,1
5803,Great transition into fall super soft and comfy great yellow without being too yellow love it,1
5804,Im a new mom and am thrilled at the structure and quality of this dress it gives me a great shape very flattering i can wear it to work with a jacket or dress it up with jewelry for a fancier event,1
5805,I loved this dress and wanted to use it for work i read the reviews and saw all the issues with the slip and was nervous but i tried it anyway and figured i could use another plain black slip i have if the one with the dress didnt fit im really happy i did because its a gorgeous dress you just may need to wear a different black slip with it i did if you already have one its no additional hassle or cost and the dress is really unique its the perfect comfortable but stylish dress for,1
5806,I have these in colors and i always wear a in pilcro i could probably size down but i like them a little loose they are great to have in the spring and summer they are very soft and very comfy,1
5807,Wanted to like this type cute print something about the width and length of this top didnt work on me was a little boxy im lbs size xss might be cuter on different body type im hourglass and athletic,0
5808,Beautiful shape and colors but the fabric felt heavier than i imagined sort of like heavy drapes also the length as others mentioned was too long i am not normally a petite but the regular was too long unfortunately it has to go back,0
5809,I wasnt sure about this dress because some of retailers cloths can make a women appear older before her time i have to say that is not the case with this dress i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size this dress could not have been more beautiful on im lbs and it fit perfect the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin i wont even need sunless tanner i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again,1
5810,This dress looks cute online but it is enormous i bought a small but it looked more like a x plus size i tried it on just in case and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo,0
5811,Loved this jacket so much i bought both colors this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands the sizing i think runs a bit large i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room highly recommend,1
5812,If i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse the problem area is evident looking at the photo the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house,0
5813,This is a great skirt i am always on the lookout for machine washable clothes that are fun and work appropriate this skirt is really flattering on my body the only thing thats a little off is the tie at the front but its still really stunning on,1
5814,The fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering it doesnt stick out too far over the butt the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights im usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one,1
5815,I donampt write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share iampm normally about a true and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large i tried this on in the store in a and because of the stretch in it it fit my hourglass shape really well i have a melodies that pencil dress in a p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special,1
5816,I bought this in a beautiful cornflower blue at my retailer store i dont see that color for sale online the blue material was not thin or see through but perhaps the white is the fit is very structured which helps me cover my mom belly i have never said this before but i think it looks better on me than it does on the model wearing white on sale i got this for about i got it for a steal i like the different directions of line patterns and the length is nice too one thing you cant,1
5817,This is my first tracy reese piece and i love it already the somewhat edgy unique grommet and navy embroidery on the neckline and upper arms is very flattering on the body the silky cotton texture surprised me its cotton viscose it drapes well and feels good on i will definitely enjoy wearing this for work or nice casual i love that it is regular bra friendly and that i dont need to stress about a low neckline i am size medium f and the medium is terrific i got the an,1
5818,Love this blouse its super comfy looks awesome with jeans this blouse runs true to size i purchased in my normal size small,1
5819,Very happy with my purchase fit very nice already received compliments,1
5820,This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small and short it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on like i said great slip but id recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model,1
5821,This dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size i am feet tall lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly it is a bit short however so i would caution that it may not be work office appropriate if you are taller like most hd in paris dresses it is also quite thin although lined this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or,1
5822,I bought a few of these tops in the long sleeved version during the fallwinter so i was super excited to see the short sleeved version come out in this brand i can wear an xs or s i typically wear a s in retailer tops if you need a tee that covers your lady parts when wearing leggings this is it it perfectly covers my rump and looks great its a nice weight too the detailing down the back is a nice touch,1
5823,This gathered jersey dress is beautiful and flows in just the right places however it runs large i normally wear a small in many retailer dresses however i ordered an xs petite in this dress based on other reviews im glad i did because it fits perfectly the dress is very flattering in the bustand the rest of the dress hangs and flows nicely this can be dressed up with statement jewelry or down depending on the occasion im happy with my purchase so much so that i bought one in,1
5824,I bought this top last week and absolutely love it it hides my muffin top and falls in all the right places it does not cling but is very flattering for my size body,1
5825,I sized up to a medium from a small and was glad i did the top drapes nicely and the fabric is soft lb b usually a small on top,1
5826,The previous review was right this jacketcoat feels and looks expensive nice weight very soft pattern is better in person i normally always wear a l and in this i cant decide between the s or m,1
5827,I love this blouse the lace panels are slightly sheer but nothing inappropriate the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe stunning bright cobalt blue color im an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable be aware this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge,1
5828,I bought this in black and i can already tell this is going to be a staple this fall and winter the unusual hem and extra long sleeves are really flattering,1
5829,It is so simple but elegant and beautiful i am and lb and extra small fits me perfectly,1
5830,I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks,1
5831,Love this top makes me look slimmer comfortable as well,1
5832,I bought this after eyeing it for months when it went on sale the colors are bright and so pretty the blue very warm flattering in intensity this pattern is very unique and the suit is well made there is some stretch making it not a chore to pull on the bust padding is minimal like a tshirt bra best for a small b cups no underwire no shaping in cups the halter has enough room to be comfortable and secure i felt this fit more like a on the bottom hips and a for top portion,1
5833,I wore this sweater while gathering ingredients for my thanksgiving feast and different women at whole foods complimented my sweater it is soft and warm would love in other colors toolike a mint green,1
5834,Ordered this dress for a summer wedding it is so cute true to size well made with a hint of tulle super comfortable for moving and dancing winner,1
5835,I cant say enough about this top absolutely adorable the pics dont do it justice it is made of a soft medium weight jersey material the lace makes the top more dressey and unique the drop waiste elongatesy our torso and is loose pleated at the bottom for interest i am pounds and long waisted this fits me perfect sz small the pleated bottom on me begins at low hips below belly button so it layes nice and is very flattering no swing to the topno bulky extra flare at al,1
5836,Great denim color and fit gives a nice feel to the waist,1
5837,Everything about this dress is perfect for my body type i used the tie belt as a cinch to gather the fabric and made the silhouette into a loose fit flare i have a large upper body and small lower half so maybe the excess fabric balances out my body but looks terrible on other shapes i am dd and i purchased the medium petite,1
5838,I had been looking for a onepiece that is fashionable yet practical fabric is beautiful fit is impeccable no complaints on lack of support i find if you tie it tight up top its very practical this was the perfect choice for me i am lbs and ordered the small,1
5839,This dress first caught my eye because of the beautiful color combination and when i tried it on i was sold its super soft and comfy and just the right amount of coverage,1
5840,Love this dress will go from fall to winter so comfy got it in medium and fits great,1
5841,Its just not for me and i really like it its made very well and it looks great from the front not so much from the side im a c and this shirt bells out a lot from my chestso much that i will be returning it i look like i have an extra lbs on me,1
5842,Bought this because i dont have a puffer vest and living in san diego i wanted a layering piece its much cuter on but it does like much of retailers clothes run a bit small got tons of compliments on it when i wore it while shopping round town very pricey but since the hood detaches and its reversible i guess its worth it treat yoself,1
5843,I agree with the other reviewer who said she cannot believe its not flying off the shelf this looks gorgeous on and the fit is perfect i ordered my usual size m i am dd and it looks amazing it is breezy and flowing but without the baggy look it is so cute with jeans or leggings the fabric is the perfect weight light but still thick enough that its comfortable and my light bra is not seen underneath love this top,1
5844,My new go to skirt great color for transitioning from summer to fall i love the pockets and detailing and yes oh so soft,1
5845,This vest is super cute on it definitely has kept me warm this winter,1
5846,This is a beautiful coat no one has mentioned how beautifully the pattern matches even across the arms coordinating with the front i love the lower button as it allows for arm movement and contributes to the casual slouch the only complaint i have is there is a slight dark spot above both pockets this appears to be a sewers mark for placement i think i have figured out how to disguise it without marring the fabric but second item from retailer with marks quality control i am keeping th,1
5847,I got this coat because i needed something black and thought the plaid was black its not but thats my fault and i love it anyway its perfect for our temperate seattle fall and winter not too light not too heavy i get a ton of compliments im and about and a medium fits perfectly,1
5848,I immediately purchased this dress when it came into store at it hits enough above the knee to be flirty but still not too short and is appropriate for me to wear to work sleeves are fitted which helps to balance the trapeze fit im just concerned with keeping the lace in good condition but overall i love the dress,1
5849,Absolutely perfect for summer great weight lovely soft lining love pockets in any robe sleeve length is perfect actually flattering if you consider robes such a thing i love it,1
5850,Its thin knit with a unique and pretty neckline but unfortunately its scratchy will not last i just received it and it looks like it would fall apart after a few wears its a nice shade of offwhite at least for me its a no that will get sent back straight away,0
5851,I was obsessed with this dressjumpsuit after i read all the great reviews even tho i had never seen it in person it was already on sale and sold out online so i called a bunch of stores and finally was able to track one down in the navy colorway in my size its tts so glad i made the effort its as great as everyone says it is i love how its party in the back im so it was pretty much floor length on me,1
5852,I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size,1
5853,This dress looked adorable online but unfortunately its not flattering at all and its completely seethrough completely the material is so thin that i cant imagine it would hold up very well over time this one is definitely going back,0
5854,This is not your traditional moth sweater in that it is not soft and cozy this sweater is great for upcoming summer nights at the beach while fireside or out on the boat i havent been the biggest fan of the lace up trend but this one is more traditional nautical feeling than others which i did like its pretty true to size so i wouldnt size up or down for any reason they paired it with a cloth stone white button down underneath at our store and it looks great layered too,1
5855,I love these jeans welli have not worn them out yet so not sure if they will stretch but just in terms of fit and cut i really like them i normally wear ch or ag in or i got these in and they fit perfectly i love the stretch great color not too thin very comfie i was worried about too much flare but not a problem they are very long but i am only and i will be hemming them about inches,1
5856,This looked fabulous on the model of course and i love sweater dresses but even in an xs i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere a definite return,0
5857,This dress is so beautiful the color is even more vibrant in person a stunning emerald green it is well made and doesnt go too low under your arm which sometimes happens with halters the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top look at the back view photo online you can see it there at first i was surprised by it because i didnt see that on the front view but then i decided it was fun and flirty i received numer,1
5858,I am so glad that i got this sweaterit is just perfect,1
5859,I wish this fit me better i love the inside fur it is extremely soft but it doesnt look flattering at all it makes my shoulders look really broad and it was shorter in the length than i wanted it wanted it fit over my butt or cover half and it sits a little below my waist unfortunately i am taking it back great idea though,0
5860,Im dying for this skirt in the picture where is it,1
5861,I found this set once while browsing the website i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it as luck would have it my mom surprised me with a gift card so i applied it to my purchase im so happy with the set its wonderfully flattering and makes me feel sexy i want one in every color,1
5862,Great material quality and versatility is there it is easy to get in and out of which is hard to find and the fit is adjustable at the waist,1
5863,I dont normally write reviews but i love this shirt its sooo soft and hangs perfectly not to mention it takes what could be a boring tshirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves its beyond comfortable i purchased one and went back immediately to get another i can tell these will be some of my goto tees plus they are a steal on sale i am and medium is perfect,1
5864,I saw the two star review and wanted to share my opinion i saw this item that had been returned to a store and i love it the fabric is a bit sheer and i think will require a nude tank underneath but i think its adorable dont be scared away by the review below,1
5865,Im glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cuteit runs a little big so im glad i ordered a size down i like that it can be worn open or buttoned it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well its definitely more on the casual side but still a very versatile piece in my closet love it,1
5866,Currently wearing right now purchased during the first days of the tag sale runs large ie i typically wear ml and ended up going with a small definitely need a tank underneath as the hook does not close the top of fully like the blue color the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed outa must at the tag sale price,1
5867,I am in love with this top it is so comfortable and lovely it runs a touch big like most items of this brand,1
5868,Great comfortable tank cool added detail in the straps runs big so size down i wear both a medium and large at retailer and got this in a small,1
5869,Not much to say fits tts a beautiful top colors are striking,1
5870,This dress is beautiful and unusual i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i boughtthe turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person which isnt necessarily a bad thing there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also cant see in the picture but they arent gaudy or too stevie nicksbohemian i didnt find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer notedits my normal size and though im a little chesty,1
5871,This was a bit of an impulse purchase but im glad i added it its a pretty standard tank but is thoughtfully and well made for example the arm holes are not enormous like they are on some tops i wish everything fit like this the cut at the neckline isnt too modest or too low and the fold over of the drawstrings are structured enough that they dont flop over,1
5872,I am so happy with this i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it as i expected it to be of lesser quality than what i found it to be it is a medium weight weave grey sweater with a beautiful design and texture one of those pieces that you will tire of long before it wears out it is a great layering piece but not over bulky or structured tops as it is very smooth fitting without a whole lot of give that is to say it is not loosely woven so it is better over a snug fitting item the colo,1
5873,I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever so im a huge fan of flowy topsthis one looked cute online but i wasnt sold on it and passed then i went to the store the next day and saw it and the colors were more vibrant so i thought why not try it on though i wasnt that excited about it i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla momenttotally transformed how it looked on me and in person i love it it was one of those instant im buyi,1

5877,I saw this online and said to myself next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress i am glad i did i bought the neutral dress off whitetanblack because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions i am pounds the small fit me perfect in retailer dresses i am between a smallmed the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to,1
5878,This top is delicate and so feminine it is beautiful does run small i had to size up im usually a m and had to buy l it has no stretch so i needed room for movement,1
5879,I ordered the white in p i wanted red but was sold out and dont have a white one so thought why not i really liked the fit flirty flattering very nice love the crossed straps in the back as someone mentioned the fabric is a bit heavy for summer but since i spend a lot of time indoors in a cold environment no biggie i probably will have a seater on top of it too the cut is flattering chest area not too snug and i can wear a strapless more comfortable for me lbs in,1

5881,I love this top it has a relaxed fit without being frumpy and it looks great with boyfriend jeans or skinny jeans and boots its a great soft fabric that doesnt require a cami underneath wish there were other colors,1
5882,Really great shirt i made the mistake of ordering normal size xs and it was way too small this is more like ordering in dress shirt size so think etc definitely going to have to send back and order up to s or m will be a keeper once i get the right fit,1
5883,I really love these leggings the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting quality is great i am and lbs the sm fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option but still would not hesitate to buy again i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colorsthats how happy i am with this purchase,1
5884,This dress is a great dress for spring and summer and early fall events its surprisingly light weight and comfortable you can pair different shoes with the dress due to the various colors which makes it easy to dress up and down i definitely recommend if youre looking for a fun floral feminine dress,1
5885,The title says it allthis fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials shoulder is a knit sweaterlike navy fabric is interesting however that is where the positive comments end on this one the top is so scratchy stiff and frankly uncomfortable i cannot imagine wanting to wear it it could benefit from a lining and that might have solved the problem of scratchy itchy fabricthe stiff fabric of the bo,0
5886,For some reason they are not replenishing this shirt even though it sells out like wildfire i got a small even though i was pretty sure i needed an extra small this shirt is pretty wide not prohibitively wide but not a fitted shirt by any means id love to get this in my size if they ever opt to sell more in the ivory,1
5887,I have been looking for a nice white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all maybe because i am petite but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat who wants that so sending it back,0
5888,Not a pretty blouse its quite utilitarian in design and it runs enormous,0
5889,This top is so pretty and easy to wear the material is super soft its long enough to tuck in as pictured but looks fine untucked the back is gorgeous and will prompt me to wear my hair up to show it off great purchase on retailer weekend id be surprised if it lasts long enough to make it to sale,1
5890,The online picture does not do this top justice much cuter in person soft and so comfortable got this in my usual xs paired with a white fluffy sweater and jeans to wear to a casual charity event hope they do more of this top in other colors,1
5891,Im lbs and small worked perfectly great dress,1
5892,Im and lbs i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up and when i did i couldnt breathe i tried again and ordered a sp and its perfect now i just need somewhere to wear it,1
5893,Great fitted tee nice styling hard to find tees that are fitted they seem to make most of them these days like boxes i suppose because its easier to make this looks great and feels good true to size loving it,1
5894,I normally wear a and that technically fit if i didnt plan to sit i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress needless to say ill wear it on our next date,1
5895,I couldnt wait to get this top in the mail since they didnt have it at my local retailer but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit the white is completely seethru i cant believe how sheer the material is especially for the price even as the shirt is lying down i can see through both layers of it the fit runs small and short,0
5896,Oh how i have searched for a midrise bottom that was not matronly and finally i have found one they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color and speaking of the color the blue is beautiful i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years i am lbs and the small fit perfect,1
5897,Had high hopes for this seemingly cute skirt to use as a basic in my spring and summer outfits however that was not the case this skirt is not lined and the material is so so basically for the price i was underwhelmed and will return it,0
5898,I loved fabric print and back detail design however was a little too boxy to be flattering on me even at great price i sent it back,0
5899,This is a great piece which has flow grace and charm the blue is a beautiful color i love it and received numerous complements after wearing it one time,1
5900,I found this sweater to fit me just as pictured i am lbs and ordered a small it hits length wise the same as pictured and is just as flowy with a lot of fabric super cute with a grey top white skinnys and brown leather sandals love it,1
5901,I wore this to a wedding yesterday and received several compliments the dress is well made and very comfortable i know i will wear it again,1
5902,I hesitated to purchase this dress because of the color but it is a beautiful deep pink that i think would work with all skin tones i ordered a size down as recommended by other reviewers and the dress fits perfectly the feel is amazing incredibly comfortable and not too short when you lean over,1
5903,The title says it all looks very pretty online though,0
5904,I love this skirt it is stylish and very comfortable ladies dont be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom it is flattering and slimming i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket,1
5905,Great top that can be worn so many ways i bought the top in gray because it is way more interesting in person it has just a touch of sparkle in it and lots of texture i have seen this top on several people and it seems to flatter lots of different body types,1
5906,This is a great piece you can do many things with it i wore it to work and church,1
5907,Soft versatile comfort what more could you want in a legging,1
5908,I love this dress is perfect in every way no complaints very pretty colors will wear it with a belt,1
5909,I didnt receive a jacket i received a very expensive cardigan sweater with no structural qualities to it jackets have some structure to them for example they might nip in at the waist a bit this cardigan doesnt do that it hangs in a very boxy shape the quality is great very light weight and i really love the little pockets and details but i dont needwant another cardigan im lbs and got a small the small seemed big but i think it would have fit fine if it had more st,0
5910,I love this sweater it is so comfortable and lightweight i am always warm and i can see myself wearing this sweater without getting overheated very flattering as well,1
5911,I really like how this shirt flows and feels the details are super cute double buttons in front pleats in back great shirt to transition to fall,1
5912,Its hard for me to find dresses that look good on me since i have more of a straight build and tend to carry a little extra weight in my middle however this dress was super flattering giving me some curves and hiding my tummy i got the one with the red skirt its definitely an orangered since that looked a little more polished and less casual than the green one i tried on in the store the full fluttery skirt is feminine and fun and the knit top is very soft and comfortable every sing,1
5913,This is a pretty sweater that is great for transitioning to fall wear it sleeveless on throw a leather jacket over it for cooler nights fights true to size the gray is a very pretty color great addition to my wardrobe,1
5914,This is one of my new favorite dresses i ordered this in pink and think it looks even more gorgeous in person that it does on the model its more of a reddish color the dress hugs my body in a flattering way im a b and the dress fits very comfortably but it might be a tight fit for someone with a larger bust im usually a small for retailer dresses and the small fit like a glove it is wonderfully flowy and extremely elegant i cant wait to wear this out,1
5915,I was thoroughly underwhelmed it did not hang well and the fit seemed off the tie waist just sort of hung there i could have sized down but i didnt even want to bother it was pretty boring and flimsy for,0
5916,These pants are a life saver i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink rolled in a towel and hung dry with good results picro does not usually fit me well these pants are the exception im and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length great for a baseball gamei will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them,1
5917,This shirt has such a fun twist on an otherwise basic jean shirt i bought this shirt on a whim despite having a closet full of denim shirts and im glad i did the fabric is the same cloth,1
5918,This jacket is a perfect lightweight cover for dresses as shown online but will also look great with jeans and tops the embroidery looks amazing and is high quality the tie in the back can make the shirt a little more formfitted while its a masculine style its has feminine details and fit this is my third hei hei jacket the sizes between them are consistent im lbs c and i wear an xs in this jacket each one ive worn a million times,1
5919,After reading many positive reviews i ordered sure glad i did i love the light airy fabric it hangs nicely i am mostly a sometimes a i ordered both sizes and the was a perfect fit i am very pleased with this purchase thought it might be too girly andor young looking on me but not so at all i got the white and i certainly like the red detail at the button holes too,1
5920,Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side but for me it was big too bad the smaller size is sold out well all peittes are sold out the length is also pretty long below the knee but in the narrow part stillso able to keep it the colors are great i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists adn they all loved it and told me to keep it winner for sure,1
5921,I love the look of this dress on model but sadly fit didnt work out very short waisted and tight across chest with very ample arm holes im c reliably a size this dress seemed at least sizes off for me my daughter usually a size could wear it except for the arm hole size and the fact that its dollars and shes going back btw novelty print means ice cream novelty little popsicles with bites taken out cute but more juvenile than i expected,0
5922,These shorts are a must they are so soft and go with every top imaginable i bought these in an xs and feel they run tts for reference i am and normally wear a or you will not regret this purchase,1
5923,This is just a fantastic dress i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps i took the regular length and found it perfect the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower im only but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for medefinitely a keeper,1
5924,Saw this top online and knew i had to have it its unique and gorgeous with the split back and twolayer design the top layer is thicker and almost like a brocadetapestry design with rich purple and yellow tones the under layer is sheer and lightweight i was able to wear this early in my pregnancy and it totally disguised any bump i had from coworkers this is def one of my top fav tops now,1
5925,Very comfortable sweater tts i felt the back was a little too low to wear to work but it works perfectly reversed tempted to buy it in another color,1
5926,This top is beautiful on i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory of which i tried both on i purchased the black as it was more stunning i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect it has a nice pleat in the front in case you have a teeny bit of tummy i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings the body fabric is a lighter cotton i am and it hits at hip length it does not have,1
5927,The color is perfect for fall dressy enough for work and looks great with a pair of jeans,1
5928,I thought it was going to be so pretty it is ugly on the macrame is thick stiff and rough the top fits awkward on top where the macrame is and the rest is shapeless yuk,0
5929,Love i got the green and it goes with so much,1
5930,What a classy special top really dresses up a pair of black slacks i actually think this is a perfect spring piece,1
5931,I love the feel of this shirt from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fabmore vivid than the photo the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck if you want a more refined flannel lookfeel this is it i find it tts if youre in between sizes i would order down,1
5932,I wanted a dress that made me feel pretty while traveling when we went out in the evening nothing really fancy but nice i saw this right when it came out and the colors and cut were exactly what i was looking for i am and normally a size in retailer dresses but i have a dd chest and a little broader ribcage even though my shoulders and hips are small which can be tricky the fit and flare style helps a lot but only if the torso is not too tight i went back and forth over the si,1
5933,I wished these fit a little better unfortunately they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didnt pull the waist of the pants up i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out needless to say i made a return,0
5934,Can be a bit itchy sometimes i guess depending on your skin havent had a problem with the sweater up to now,1
5935,This is a lovely dress and exceeded all of my expectations very unique and wellmade swing dresses can be a hit or miss sometimes but this one is perfect couldnt be happier,1
5936,Love this one i usually wear a medium got this in medium and fits perfectly i agree with the prior reviewer regarding the arms they are a little snug but i like the fit just as is the pattern and medium thinkness were just what i was looking for,1
5937,I love this top i wish i had more like this to cycle into my wardrobe,1
5938,I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry although i ended up wearing another black dress i kept this paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace this dress is easy to wear and stylish most importantly comfortable i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up but want to wear something that is not fussy and the pockets,1
5939,The dress runs big you should size down i find the weight to be great for mild winter weather the length was longer than i expected based on previous reviews,1
5940,I washed and dried this in my dryer after one wear and it shrunk to the size of a toddler shirt i dried it on medium i can not really wear it unless i want to show off my belly i loved the color lilac fit and style when i received it and immediately put it on so sad about the shrinkage for a shirt i expected a bit more retailer should suggest air drying the shirt so bummed and disappointed i would not recommend this shirt unless you can remember to air dry it every time,0
5941,I really loved the way this shirt looked on me its forgiving and flattering and really lightweight the fabric however couldnt even withstand half a days wear without snagging times and developing a hole right in the center i have no idea how this happened as i wasnt wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it such a shame this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me,0
5942,If you like the way this dress looks pictured youll love it when it arrives the patterns and colors are vibrant the fabric is of highquality and the dress is lined with a black slip for sizing im a size or and the xs is a great fit while i often order petites for dresses this petite was short enough on me to be mistaken for a tunic im,1
5943,Crew stripe sheath fitted very well until i turned around the waist section where the stripes wrap around the waist had extra fabric and didnt lay well i am lbs c waist and hip usually wear a or extra small in the maeve clothing that isnt a fitted style i bought the s which fit well except for the waist issue described above this is a fitted dress i hope this is just an issue with the dress i received it is a great style idea,0
5944,Ordered my regular size they were tight when they arrived but they stretch a lot i like the looser style so was vey pleased but think they are at least a size larger after one wear,1
5945,This is an absolutely gorgeous dress that stands out everywhere i go it runs true to size and has a slimming effect because of the detail running down the sides,1
5946,I sat on the fence almost too long on this piece and finally ordered one when it popped up as a returnso happy imwas able to snag it it is incredible i put it with my favorite closed jeans and chanel work boots and wow i also have tried belting it where the fur begins and that looks equally fabulous imput true to size as it is suppose to be roomy to many people ruin styles by trying to get them to fit in a way they were not meant toembrace the uniqueness of this piece and roder true t,1

5949,Love this tankeveryone should own it in every colorit is soft has a great shape and is super cute it goes great with so many of the pantsshorts from retailer as well summer staple for sure,1
5950,I cannot say how much i love this dress i purchased it in midnovember and im wearing it for the th time this evening which prompted me to write a review it fits tts the stomach area is slightly unforgiving but due to the dark color its not at all a deal breaker plus its a great dress to wear with opaque tights which solve the tummy issues as well what i love most about this dress is its ability to go from day to nightless formal to more formal it looks great with edgy black ankl,1
5951,I bought this shirt in black and green and now bought the orange it is casual and stylish at the same time material is soft great shirt,1
5952,Get this while you can it will not last to hit the sales it is a beautiful top with very unique colors and patternreminds me of key west it has a slight tent shape at the bottom which is not how it appears to be but the cut is very nice and well done i wouldnt size down as the armholes are not huge and then it would be too tight i will have to cut them about to not bug me and im typically a med which is the size i got i could take the sides in about on each side which is,1
5953,I love the color combination and the bodice is very falttering it has a tiny bit of stretch the tulle is also feminine i love that i could wear this with a moto jacket sizing no need for petite it was short enough in regualr size i think petite would have been too short unless you are younger,1
5954,I just got this dress in the mail and i have to disagree with the previous reviewer the embroidery on the dress is so well done and thick the material is high quality and although breathable holds up perfectly to the embroidery i usually order an extra small in loose fitting dresses and ordered the extra small in this one im pounds with a curvy build the xs was more fitted which i wanted i can belt it or wear it loose did i mention the color vibrant rich green cant wa,1
5955,Casual dinner out dress love the color mine is navy,1
5956,I ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived it didnt look quite like it does in the photos online it also runs small i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price,0
5957,I did not like this top at allbut had i looked at the fabric prior to purchasing i would not have it is polyesteri thought it was cotton so theres the first reason i didnt like it secondly there is a piece of fabric behind the laces presumably for modesty that refuses to lay flat it wrinkles up behind the lacing making it appear as if one is wearing an undershirt or cami that is not appropriate for the top it is too long for me the top hitting at top of thighthis top is just reall,0
5958,Cant wait for the weather to get warmer so i can wear this one as others have said the material is heavier but i think thats a positive as it is very structured and slimming im a fan of maeve dresses and this is no different,1
5959,These are the perfect leggings theyre so soft and they dont stretch and droop throughout a day of wearing them i ordered the grey and moss and they have different textures which is fun,1
5960,Received many compliments the first day i wore them amazing fit disagree with the other post thequality is amazing i wish they had other colors bought xs,1
5961,I love the black and pale pink of this dress the contrasting fabrics and the embroidery my favorite kind of dress creative and a little edgy but elegant and can be dressed for the office too ordered a size up from my usual size because i tried the previous dress in this style and it was a bit snug the size up was a good decision fits in the shoulders and waist better the fabrics are nice and the finishing on the dress is well done the mesh in the bodice is a little delicate and i will h,1
5962,This top is very cute very flattering and very unique love the highlow back also very comfy would recommend to anyone,1
5963,I am and a cup i tried on the small and it fits perfectly i can see how if i was bustier it could be a problem it looks better in person dressy enough for the office but comfortable fabric and nicely shaped i love this with jeans and cant wait to wear it to work,1
5964,Always get compliments when i wear these pants my mom has the exact same pants and loves them too they are great for work and transitioning to go out after i like my pants tight but these run a little small,1
5965,Weird fit and the tie just add to the problems i think id like this a lot more if it were just an open cardigan without the tie the tie seems like an after thought its flimsy and it just makes anyone wearing this look like a house no matter there size i ordered a medium black and its already in the mail,0
5966,Great pair of black pants a step up from basic leggings nice weight and a little ribbed detail on the sides would recommend,1
5967,Im with a dd bust i usually wear small in retailer cloth and stone running horses the small fit me fine but with no room for layers underneath the small was very snug would be perfect for california evenings but i live in the north east the medium still has a great shape on me still fitted at the waist inches but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress,1
5968,Lightweight warm in cold nice as a day jacket works well as a casual coat very soft but a little wooly its really nice color thinking about buying another i got the dark one,1
5969,Ive never worn a romper before but decided to give this one a try because im loving the colorspattern im so glad i did its even cuter on and very flattering my only complaint is the buttons i wish it was easier to remove and put on especially since this is a romper afterall still this is a beautiful piece,1
5970,This top is prettier in person than on the picture the picture kind of makes the material look really cheap it actually looks nice in person its very comfy and feminine showing just the right amount of skin on the arms the elastic on the waist also makes me look lbs lighter it goes good with jeans or skirts,1
5971,So soft and comfy fits great love the length i am sure it will get much wear great addition to my wardrobe,1
5972,Surprisingly this poncho is both flattering and soft i must say i didnt think the fabric would be as soft since a lot of knits have wool but this is great i purchased both xss and xss pthe petite was just slightly more fitted so i went with that i love the boat neck on me it gives the poncho an elegant look colors are nice and neutrali think i will wear this with dresses and jeans both great purchase lbs dd in waist,1

5976,Saw this at the store and it is breathtaking in person as the previous reviewer stated i too consider this a dress and not a tunic and its not really crinkled either the dress is structured very soft and so gorgeous on i tried on a regular xsmall and it fit but a bit uncomfortable at the mid section the small fit better its meant to be a bit loose bohemian looking and the hem falls right at my knees which is perfect for the office im b waist hips i have medium o,1
5977,Love trying things outside my usual style thought this might look like a sack but fell in love looks effortless easy to accessorize dress up or down comfortable keeper want to try it with platform sneaks for casual look,1
5978,This sweater is just the cutest sweet and feminine with interesting details especially in the back its very figure flattering worn closed there are adorable little buttons or it can be worn open over a dress or a camiit runs very small i usually wear a small or extra small but i bought this one in a medium mindful of the reviews im so glad i did since in addition to running small the sweater did shrink a little when i washed it even though i hand washed it in cold water it wasnt a,1
5979,This is a great versatile everyday tee the fit is flattering and the material is soft and lightweight this like many retailer tops runs large under the arms i first tried the medium and although i liked the way the tee hung it gapped in my underarms there was no small in my store so i tried on the xs it still hung nicely and no underarm gap love the simple colors denim blue and gray is a great combination liked it enough to pay full price,1
5980,This shirt feels so special it is mainly t shirt material so i will be dry cleaning to make sure it keepsits shape and delicate feel the stitching is so beautiful ill wear this with jeans and even my navy pencil skirt for work so cute,1
5981,Super comfortable i am weeks pregnant and i works great for me now and i think it will be perfect post baby also,1
5982,This sweater coat is a keeper yes it runs large but if you wear it as a coat and not a sweater it works well plus it is very warm for size i normally wear a large and i ordered a medium great for layering soft winter whites i wore this christmas shopping and everyone asked about it all day this will for sure go into my retailer classic closet,1
5983,I ordered the red and am watching for my size in the green to come back into stock i was already expecting my bra straps to be exposed not a big deal as with shoulder length hair it covers them so i found this top to be exactly as pictureddescribed it fits like it looks on the model and i thought the color to be spot on i have washed it once in the washer on cold and dried only for a few minutes on low as i like to do with delicate knits to regain shape and i think it looks as good as it di,1
5984,This is a great jacket my only issue is sleeves are way to long and had to have them shortened this upped my price by oh well its still what i wanted,1
5985,Listen to all the reviews size down i got the dress in my usual size large thinking it would fit well size i have large hips and a booty i was wrong i could camp out in the large it was super largegot the medium and its fit amazingly its a tad bit tight in the chestbarely tight but im a dd and this is not an unusual thing for i just need to wear a thinner bra and it will be perfect cant wait to wear it loving the velvet trend this fall thinking about getting the blue too,1
5986,Im and weigh lbs i purchased the xxs and it was superwide and big all over it looked like a pregnancy top and did not lay as nicely as shown on the model also not shown on the model is the front is short and the back is very long this would work better on a taller person i just find it odd that a xxs is still too big the quality of the fabric and the print is good and the laceup in the back is cute,0
5987,This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress i would recommend wearing it with leggings as shown with the model or black tights the fit is true to size i am and the length is a liittle low,1
5988,It just isnt that flattering on me it looks kind of old and dingy even though its brand new it fits fine but doesnt do much to highlight my curves it just kind of hangs there the length is somewhat awkward i bought the petite version maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny like the model its gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front which reminded me of maternity wear it does appear to be pretty well made top part is lined overall its not terrible,0
5989,I just bought this dress today and im in love i cant wait for the wedding i am wearing it to so i can wear it to other fun things too looks even more amazing in heels,1
5990,The material on this dress is gorgeous so soft the fit is flattering and casual and looks great with booties or high boots,1
5991,I love this top the detail on front top of the top is so cute the length is just right i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue also thanks for finding the top as it wasnt available at distribution center went of your way,1
5992,This jacket looks like such the statement piece online with the soft focus lens but in realitymeh i think the pattern is gorgeous and would have worked without the studs and the studs are unique and would have worked on a simple solid color but put them together and you have the unwanted love child of a laura ashley bag and a marching band jacket to me it all felt more cloying than cleverthe quilted fabric and boxy cut of the jacket also makes it unwieldy and uncomfortable since i,0
5993,Love the leggings very soft and comfortable i ordered two pair one sm and one ml the sm fit better on me but both will work,1
5994,Fits nicely and made with highquality material it definitely makes you look very put together with some nice slacks for work the scarf is a very nice detail and actually doesnt look like it is a part of the shirt love,1
5995,I love the way this looks on me definitely flattering on curvyfullfigured girls i am a c and bought an xl i dont like things that are too tight or that cling to the wrong areas if they had xl in other sizes i would buy it in every color can be dressed up or down im very happy with this purchase,1
5996,I loved this shirt and attempted to buy it however the armhole is so small i couldnt barely get the shirt off and almost had to call someone into the dressing room to pull it off of me im usually a and i tried on the and and both shirts had the same problem it wasnt exactly the sleeve that was too tight but the arm hole that was not big enough it pulled across the top of my chest and was not roomy enough to slip in and out of which was odd because the rest of shirt was fine i d,0
5997,Great fabric nice legging substantial fabric more structured than a typical legging,1
5998,Versatile piece to finish out your look love how it goes with so much of my wardrobe simple comfortable and classic,1
5999,I love this top i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors i fell in love with it online and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large based on what i saw in the picture fortunately they had it at my local retailer so i was able to try it on my usual xs fit perfectly great flow soft and casual perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter,1
6000,These pilcro jeans are so very cute i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans but i didnt want to chance them not being available in my size the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg they do run a bit big i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy,1
6001,This top is cute light and summery ordered a smallis a little shortboxy but otherwise fits true to size great summerwarm weather top,1
6002,I bought an extra small and i love it im a size its warm its comfortable it fits with everything can be dressed up or down its not lined but it is well finished and does not feels like a sweater coatit feels like you have a new friend,1
6003,These pants are so flattering comfortable and silky smooth a versatile fall staple for sure i bought my usual and they fit perfectly,1
6004,Love this sweatshirt will look great with gray pilcro jeans i bought recently xs fits perfectly and i am usually a s or xs,1
6005,I do not have a waist that goes in i either have to wear shift dresses that are cut slim or find fit and flare pieces that create a waist for me this is the latter its really cute different and flattering it has a nice mix of graphic sophistication with a somewhat romantic silhouette it is gauzy with ruffles and tiers the offwhite slip underneath is great for a couple reasons it provides a nice underlayer that is just visible underneath the turtleneck top cutting the schoolmar,1
6006,The photo does a disservice to this beautiful sweater it is truly special with a lace scallop pattern down the front and across to the back it is absolutely beautiful the sweater is lightweight perfect for a cool day or in an office on a cold day i snapped up the grey and may purchase the green if it goes on saleunless they can show this sweater off better i am certain it will i am usually right between a small and a medium and needed the medium in this sweater the small was bit tight,1
6007,This skirt is really cute its body conscious but not tight the material is soft and stretchy making it flattering and comfy while its smooth in the back the draping in the front could hide tummy issues as another reviewer said you can dress this skirt up or down i typically wear a s in bottoms at retailer and the s fit tts also i love the different take on the highlow hem,1
6008,This skirt was horrible on me it was loose in the waist tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom the material also felt cheap and clingy i guess the fit is tts but its hard to tell given how strange the cut was,0
6009,Im short so its a little long on me but its super cute and i love it,1
6010,Very cool top i purchased this in the black which is more of a very dark gray imagine sanded silk its very figure flattering and accentuates curves it also disguises any minor tummy issues not to clingy but follows your form the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style definitely a winner,1
6011,I was in my local retailer to scope out a different piece when i spotted this very attractive welldesigned jacket sparrows jacket looks dynamite on the scale is perfect for me the high level of detail is ideal i chose this over getting an oversized sweater coat it felt like these proportions were most flattering on my body it will be appropriate for work or nice casual events i bought the medium true to size i am an top f although i largely buy online sometimes you ju,1
6012,I couldnt decide between the black and the red this is a really cute dress that could be dressed up or down just be aware of the high somewhat tight neck,1
6013,I really wanted to love this sweater however it fell much shorter on my frame than it falls on the model between my belly button and hip and the sleeves ended just below my elbow and were much more voluminous than they appear in the product shot i do have long monkey arms though so on someone more petite it would probably fit more like the model shotthe quality of the knit seems nice however the zipper used is very slim and light weight and got stuck twice just while i was trying i,0
6014,Extremely cute sweater but after having worn it twice its already pilling up id expect more for a sweater,0
6015,I saw this in the store in blue and loved it wore it and received lots of compliments just bought the second color online as there is free shipping today great dress for work as the weather is warming up,1
6016,The color is a very soft peach and the knit top over the gauze is a very light summerweight knit i can see this being worn casual or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt pants,1
6017,I returned this item it was soft very blah fabric nothing special,0
6018,Ive never owned a romper and never had any desire to but the classy design in black soft flowy fabric reeled me in prompting me to push my boundaries a bit im so glad i did i dont think i have any other piece of clothing that makes me feel so classy or so fun and certainly not at the same time i wear it to work in an office environment with a cardigan and the cardigan goes off after work as i run errands or play with the kids i love it and it even has pockets im a sucker for,1
6019,Softest denim they feel like theyve been through the wash a hundred times already im pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me im and bought the petite for a perfect fit these will become a goto pair,1
6020,Love this dress fits tts great fitted slip underneath beautiful lace design im the dress size small hits right above my knees very versatile dress may be dressed up or down depending on shoes,1
6021,This top does run quite large i am normally an xs or s in tops im lbs a and i was debating between the xs and xsp the xxs was out of stock so i wasnt able to try it on for size the xs is noticeably longer and fits more like it does on the model but it was also a little too low cut for me on top the straps are twisted and not adjustable so i went with the xsp which is what im wearing in the photo it does come up a little shorter but it fits me better in the bust the f,1
6022,Every once in a while i randomly pick something from the sales floor that really knocks it out of the park print is subtle and pretty crochet neck really lightens up the look of a long top with a lot of coverage its cut perfectlybeautifully drapes without being so flowy its mistaken for maternity worth full price word of warning i saw one top on the rack with a small amount of crochet that was unraveling so may need to check before buying im usually a size purchased size small,1
6023,I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not seethrough at all i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it also machine washable is a major plus,1
6024,I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size and im normally an or and the fit perfectly dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since its so beautiful the bell sleeves are really cute i highly recommend the dress,1
6025,This gorgeous sky blue sweater was already in the dressing room to try on i was not shopping for anything like this whatsoever well i tried it on and decided it was a mustbuy i usually need a petite in sweaters and coats but this one because i prefer a longer length fits just fine and the sleeves are not too long the color is beautiful it seems to be warm enough for sf evenings it think the price is quite reasonable for a sweatercoat like this a great purchase,1
6026,I love this sweater it is true to size and not itchy at all i am and i bought the small other reviews said it wasnt as long as it looks pictures but it is the same length on me as it shows on the model you can wear this with so many things i cant wait for fall so i can wear it,1
6027,Love this top the material is very comfortable and its loose fitting which is what i was looking for,1
6028,Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge im petite a bit curvy and shortwaisted so many of todays lowrise styles just do not work for me however these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit comfortable and flattering too ive actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants i always have some gapping in the waist but its not much of an issue with these more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part i was advised by th,1
6029,I loved everything about this dress the fit the style and the ability to wear in the fall i wore it once washed it in gentlehandwash cycle in cold water and laid it out flat to dry per the instructions and it shrank at least a full size its going back i am so sad as i said earlier i really loved this dress,0
6030,I saw these in the connecticut retailer but didnt want to pay full price the very next week they went on sale i ordered xs im small frame lbs while the length is perfect the waist is a bit tight for pjs though not tight enough to return as i love everything else about these theyre like wearing a painting of fine art light weight flannel hope they hold up well iin cold water wash,1
6031,I find it very hard to find a dress never like the way they look on methis one fits like a glove flatters my silhouette which is difficult because even though i am at a good weight my waist is never small looks like million bucks on mei love it,1
6032,These are the most comfortable trousers in my whole wardrobe love them,1
6033,Such a cute and comfy dress to wear colors are vibrant just as they appear in the picture the m fit was better for me than the small lbs for reference its such a great dress to throw on and go love it,1
6034,Love these i wore them today for the first time and got tons of compliments they are comfy and sooooo cute for summer also fyi they make my butt look great,1
6035,The print is beautiful the fabric has a nice weight i actually bought this because im early in pregnancy and wanted a dress i can wear during the transition period because of its swing shape this is one of those rare dresses that looks good on me now and will still look good on me in months when ive got a huge bellyfitwise i am lbs d and ordered a large but i am exchanging it for a medium the arm holes are also a bit large,1
6036,This is a cute swing top tts but generous best thing about it the color i got purple and it is so pretty and saturated i think itll look great with big gold hoop earrings alone or under a cardigan or denim jacket id consider other colors at sale price,1
6037,Cute to wear with leggings i like that its easy to just throw on its fitted at the top and easy to chase kids around but doesnt look too momish or sloppy,1
6038,I walked into retailer with low hopes of finding a dress for a friends spring wedding as a lot of this seasons dresses are more casual but was drawn to this pretty number for multiple reasons it can certainly be dressed up or down depending upon accessories the fabric feels incredible it has pockets and its really fun yet classy as heck typically i wear a m in dresses but they only had a in store so i took it and made it work by tightening the sash a bit extra and wearing a bra w,1
6039,I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it when i tried it on i went a complete size down im usually an but i snagged this beauty in a the top part really does run larger so unless you have really broad shoulders youll need to size down the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place and the little tie in the front is awesome because not only is it an interesting detail it can be loosened or tightened d,1
6040,This is a beautifully made sweater i bought this sweater in ivory yesterday i wore it today and received many compliments i think the sweater is adorable its soft and warm the neck is perfect i like that its not as restrictive as a turtleneck the long sleeves add character and help to make it interesting i highly recommend itim looking for a black one,1
6041,I found this at my local store on sale and immediately snatched it up i did not think of the wrap flying open until i got home and tried it on again luckily i was able to sew it up enough without compromising the drape and movement of the dress and without causing anyou pulling or puckering which isnt always easy when working with jerseythat said i really like the dress otherwise its super soft and i think ill get a lot of wear out of it when i want something cute and comfy to put on,1
6042,I own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy,1

6047,I have been eyeing these jeans for a while but was hesitant because of the price and also because im short waisted so dont normally like high rise pants i finally pulled the plug when i had a off code still expensive imo i am so glad i finally bought them they are well worth the price i am with longer legs and i agree with the other reviewers that these run a little longer than one might anticipate they hit about inches above my ankle bone which suits me just fine they are,1
6048,Beautiful top you can wear it as a wide boat neck or as its pictured off the shoulder the bottom is tight with ruching which makes it very flattering i found the fit true to size love the neutral light brown color will look nice with white denim for the summer excited to dress this unique top up or down,1
6049,This sweater is so well made and uniquely designed one of the main reasons i love retailer is for how toy make wool sweaters timeless affordable and versatileworth the money,1
6050,The coral is stunning the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you cant see in the picture it isnt a straight cut the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans or dressing down something fancier,1
6051,This was completely different than i expected the xss was so large that it looked messy unfortunately i had to return it,0
6052,I really like this top for reference i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large however in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely in any brand other than retailer my usual size is m as i am d bust lbs,1
6053,When i received this dress in the mail i was thrilled i loved the color and the style although a bit too much material but comfortable when i went to show my husband the dress his first comment was very sexy i can see your underwear and your skin i dont understand why no one mentioned this in any of the comments on this dress when i went into the light i saw that the dress was see through and i sadly had to return it,0
6054,Saw this online but it said the store was out of stock imagine my surprise when i went to my local store and found it in both a small and a medium in white i tried them both on but not a lot of difference in the sizing the small had a smaller headneck opening causing it to be a bit tough to remove without getting makeup on it which the small did the medium fit very very close to the small but a smidge bigger at the neck the shoulders of both seemed to fit the same with maybe a tad mo,1
6055,Saw these in the store and had to have them i wear them rolled up they are lightweight whenever i wear them i want to smile the birds with hats are so funny i wear them to run errands have worn them when flying etc cant say enough good things about these pants they wash well no ironing needed,1

6057,This top is very cute and if you are short you will love it i am tall and the dividing line of color block kept rising up over my bust so it looked weird it made it look like an ill fitting maternity top had to go back,0
6058,Love love love this top i want to wear it every day not only is it striped which is super chic but also the peplum hits lower so it really accentuates your waistline in a good way plus its soft like so many wonderul bordeaux tops are i wish they had this is solid colors because id buy them all for reference i bounce between an xs and s at retailer more along the lines of sand i got the xs in this and it still has room lbs ab chest,1
6059,I purchased this top in the purple it is much prettier in person then in the picture the color is rich and vibrant i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off i felt that it flowed perfectly not as full as some of the fall retailer tops which are too full for mei am around and a little on the broad side so perhaps on someone smaller it might be overbeari,1
6060,I adore this top it is super soft drapes nicely and looks great with a ton of different bottoms i am lbs and ordered this in both xs my usual size and s i ended up keeping the s most cloth stone xs tops swim on me so i was a little surprised but glad i tried both my only concern is how it will hold up after washing it it is a gauzelike material and i just hope i can get a long life out if this top,1
6061,Great green color drapes well nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater,1
6062,I bought this beautiful dress at the store yesterday and had some assistance from staff which was great the tie that another reviewer referred to is essential i believe when tied in the back slightly high and sinched just enough to define smallest part of waist it falls beautifully and frames the center panel perfectly i personally would never cut the tie off at least try it this way before making that decision,1
6063,The front of this top is pretty thin and you can see through it,1
6064,I absolutely love this tee i normally dont buy two of the same thing but i bought it in both black and mauve during a december sale i ordered a size small and it fits tts it can be worn with leggings or skinny jeanscords i love pairing it with skinny jeans and boots best its very slimming and so soft,1

6068,I love this top the design quality and look are all insanely gorgeous i got this top during the off tops promo which helped so much with the cost and i was trying to use up a store credit i had on something of high quality after going through a whirlwind of exchanges that resulted in much disappointment i couldnt be more thrilled with this choice it is so flattering on beautiful color and cut the only complaint i have is slightly minor and its in relation to the hidden bac,1
6069,Runs large and it also had a small hole in the back had to return it,0
6070,Ordered the biggest size available the large the arms are so tight i couldnt get it on looked like it may have fit in the body so i dont understand why so constricting in the arms i dont have big arms either fabric is thin but the color is pretty cant recommend id pass on this one,0

6073,The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it however i too noticed the delicateness of the material it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray including next to the kimonos label so sad,0
6074,This is the perfect cool day cozy teacher sort of sweater or if youre having a mr rogers sort of day the material is soft and comfortable and the color is just as it appears in the photo looks great with a button down shirt underneath,1
6075,I absolutely love this dress im always leery about buying lace and white but i love this offwhite color and style i was able to stretch the sleeves a tad to make them more fluttery but they arent as fluttery as the photo looks definitely more of a cap sleeve got so many compliments,1

6078,I love this top i got lucky and found it returned at a store always always check the found and collected racks ladies it was a and i was a little worried it would be much to large but it fit great i like that i can wear something under it or on its own i didnt fit it too short but im a little under and roughly lbs a highly recommend,1
6079,I bought this in the blue motif and i love the colors of the plaid the first day i wore it i received many compliments the armholes are a bit low but i wore a cami underneath i dont think it is that noticeable unless your arms are raised the whole time i like my shirts to be a bit longer and this is perfect since i have a longer torso i am normally a size mb and the med fit perfectly,1
6080,I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short but they balance me out perfectly they are light and airy and perfect for summer i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume and my latigo clogs which give me some height these are my new favorite goto pants,1
6081,The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touchi layer it with various camis for a different look each timei ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade and goes well with so other many colorslooks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effectclassic yet uniqueruns very true to size,1

6083,This blouse does have a flowy boxy shape to it but the details make up for that when i wear it tucked into a skirt it looks wonderfully flattering i tried on an xs and considered looking for a xxs but i feel that size would probably end up being too short instead of more fitted,1
6084,This is a beautiful light weight sweater great for the texas weather the red is a great color for the holidays too,1

6088,This is an adorable dress medium weight i highly recommend,1
6089,I was excited to receive this coat for my annual travel to switzerland but hesitated to order it online without seeing it first due to the price it arrived last night with the buttons falling off and a large hole in the front pocket the lining inside is has a very cheap plasticky feel and i can also see small rips possibly forming in the lining in addition the collar on the coat is extremely bulky and the shoulders are padded underneath the fur which makes ones shoulders appear like a lineba,0
6090,This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it im too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material i wouldnt want to discourage anyone from trying it,1
6091,They fit perfectly and the stretch makes them very comfortable,1
6092,Bought this cardigan on a whim as a birthday treat pre myself love it i get a compliment everyone i wear it the quality is great fits great with a roomy feel,1

6096,I ordered this dress to wear to a summer wedding in san francisco i liked that it had sleeves a plus when i was trying it on i found that it was a little snug then realized it was the slip which is not too tight at all once the dress is on it helps to smooth those little bumps it is drop waist style which skims the torso then flares out prettily all in all very complimentary beautiful color well made very pleased it will be comfortable and perfect at the wedding,1

6100,Ive had my eye on this for awhile glad it was still in stock really great deep wine color soft more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture love,1
6101,Great skirt i bought the red and paired it with a casual white button down i feel like the top definitely needs to be short or tucked in for the look to work i am typically a in bottoms and went with the small in this the xs probably fits more like its intended to but it is very curvehugging and i was more comfortable with the looser fit of the small especially since i am tucking in a blouse there is stretch in the skirt and the fabric has a nice feel,1
6102,Ive worn this top with leggings and straight leg jeans looks great with both its almost like a t shirt but not as clingy and way more style im and the large fit great it hid my leftover baby belly and still looked stylish with flats or boots only complaintbis that the armholes are cut low so side of my bra is visible but overall its well worth it,1
6103,Fits like a dream not too tight not too loose arm holes arent too big a common problem for me in sleeveless retailer topsdresses the sweater material isnt itchy and the pattern is unusual and eyecatching i felt confident in this dress and received many compliments great addition to the spring wardrobe,1

6108,I have a racetrack bra that works with the arm holes a bit large like you see on the model so i am not concerned about them i may or may not have my tailor tack them in length was good knee length some of retailer dresses are a tad short for my yr old self shape was flattering ive some weight on my bum and things even though im small the back of the dress hung well not clinging to the derrire the swing shape didnt overly accentuate my hips i really love the dress its a kn,1
6109,Absolutely love this skirt it is well made and fits as normal i love the fact that it can be dressed up or down,1
6110,Great dress received tons of compliments downside to the dress is it stretched a bit and was feeling a bit loose by the end of the evening,1
6111,Maeve once again created another beauty love love love i purchased the crocheted cape in cream and have received numerous compliments on the dress get it while it lasts i typically wear a in maeve and got the in this one,1
6112,I ordered the mauve in size xl and it fits true to size it matched the photos online all of the details are prettier in person its delicate but its washeddried well very pretty shade of mauve,1
6113,This is by far the most comfortable bra ive ever owned i love the convertible strap feature its great for shirts with a back cutout,1
6114,This skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps the skirt has a nice wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too muchthe fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is linedi am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels,1
6115,This is a beautiful blousesheer and feminine i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual it is a full topcant tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size this is supposed to be a full shorter fiti would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b,1
6116,This dress was so cute and comfortable i said it runs big but i think that may also simply be the style of it i paired it with some cute boots and received many compliments love it,1
6117,This dress is of great quality and design the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress i am short and it is a little long on me it is between my calf and my ankle but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it with the right shoes it is a real winner i think this dress would be flattering on every body type highly recommend,1
6118,This is a beautiful pieceand a really great deal on sale it is sheer but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but speciallooking summer outfit,1
6119,I was very excited when this top arrived in the mail it is so so beautiful i love the material and the brightness of the colors it will be a perfect top this holiday season,1
6120,Comfortable and cute versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything,1
6121,I seldom buy prints and almost never buy a traditional button front blouse but this shirt is my favorite purchase of the season i chose the skier print as it was whimsical and subtle rather than wear it buttoned and tucked i use it as a jacket over solid tees i bought it a size larger for this reason i like the layered look and the fabric is flowy and drapes nicely i have been so pleased with every piece of maeve clothing i have purchased once again thinking slightly outside my comfortz,1
6122,Yes it is boxy but by design because it is a shorter length and sheer it isnt an issue for me even as a petite it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if its just floating on your body what doesnt show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse charcoal white threads running throughout the design this adds to the classy look of this topgreat to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out,1
6123,Ive been looking for the right red dress for a while and this one is a winner flattering fit comfy quality fabricmakes me feel great even right after having a baby fits tts and i cant wait to rock this beauty,1
6124,I purchased this in the green color and in person it does have a little bit of blue in it so its a very flattering color the blouse has a simple shape but the details are what makes this an interesting piece it looks as good under a suit as it does with jeans and a leather jacket fits tts,1
6125,This is cute i was hesitant to buy but glad i did it has a unique cut the fit is tighter to the body but its very flattering i purchased a xxs petite in the blue color the blue seems more on the gray side to me but it is mottled and really pretty the neckline comes all the way up as shown the detail on the neckline and the ruffle shown at a bias is really cool i love it pair it with a skirt or jeans adorable,1
6126,I happened upon this one in store in my xs size online it would not catch my eye but in person i love it it fits like a glove and is so soft and elegant with the knit detailing pleats and length in the back i couldnt pass this one up i also agree with the other reviewers about colors,1
6127,I know a lot of folks thought this top was too bigboxy but im pretty slim up top with a big booty quintessential pear shape and i think the shape is totally flattering your mileage may vary but with free returns id just try it on first i sized down one size which helped and got the raspberry colored one i adore the color its impossibly vibrant and beautiful for spring summer or fall the eyelets dont have any cloth underneath just bare skin but theyre so small that i don,1
6128,I adore this top i ordered in the white and wear it with everything i am a c and size and purchased the xs it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch i just bought the black as well as it truly it a great staple piece forewarning do not dry this my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one since it shrunk so much the fabric is lightweight and great for summer but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath tank top etc,1
6129,I wasnt sure about this shirt at first glance its difficult to see in the picture but the top of the shirt and the peplum are two completely different fabrics with the top having a much looser weave however it looks great on the blue color is very saturated and pretty the fit in the shoulders and arms is stretchy and comfortable and it hangs in a really flattering and comfy way on my hourglass frame im pretty busty dd i thinki usually have to wear l in retailer tops unless theyr,1
6130,This top is so cute its my go to top dress up or down looks really cute with skinny skirt i have the ivory and just ordered the dark grey one great thing this top has pockets i would buy this in many colors if i could yes its full but a cute full but i love full tops i think this is true to size its not tight and i dont think it would be as cute tight i actually like mine on me better than the one on the modellol washes like a dream and you can dry it in the dryer,1
6131,I love this tank it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws it rolls up every time i walk or do anything it becomes very bothersome,0
6132,As much as i buy from retailer this is my first review the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person i wanted something that was a bit flowy but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie the most unflattering dress ever and since its only available online im not interested enough to try a smaller size,0
6133,This dress ladies is simply amazing and perfect,1
6134,These are beautiful pants the wine color is rich and they are very soft they just run really small i normally wear a regular but often i have to roll the length up a bit so this time i ordered a p thinking it would be the same just shorter but i could hardly even pull them over my slinder size foot i am going to exchange them for a regular i so hope that they fit they are so lovelyi totally recommend just order a size or maybe two up though to be fair maybe peti,1
6135,This vest is the best even though it has no sleeves it truly keeps you warm it feels like youre wearing a soft blanket around you it is my favorite,1
6136,I love this dress and it is going to be my goto summer dress the fabric is great with just a slight amount of stretch it is true to size i am ft and it is not too short on me the arm holes and the rest of the fitting is just perfect the pockets are also very functional the color is a darker moss than a brown that it looks like in the pictures the retailer dresses i order online offlate are returned of the time due to ill fitting or for not being what i expected in general however,1
6137,I tried it on in the store loved it but didnt purchase then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it its lightweight and perfect for southern california the embroidery adds funk and femininity im and feel like this works well for any age im typically a large or and the large fit perfect i cant wait till the temps drop so i can wear it,1
6138,Bought this skirt in the light plum color nice soft corduroy fabricit fit well not too short will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots my only complaint i wish it had pockets,1
6139,You know when youre shopping and you dont buy something you like but later you cant stop thinking about it that was the case with his sweater i saw it paired with a cute top in the store so i tried it on on a whim im so glad i eventually got it its toasty soft and thick with the perfect amount of quirk,1
6140,I am a size and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous it looked like a pirate sack its unfortunately going back,0
6141,Amazing pants i saw them at my local retailer and knew they would be great addition to my wardrobe inperson is even better than photo they are flattering and i love that the pattern lends itself to many optionscould be an ivory sweater or blouse or perhaps a mustard jacketso much fun i am lbs and went with the,1

6143,Man this dress is the worst i dont understand how it looks the way it does on the model agree with previous reviewer there must be a minimum of pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back this dress looks so cute but is so so so disappointing in person sweater collar and cuffs stiff and bulky dress billowy and sacklike not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like,0
6144,I was aware of the split sleeves when i purchased hoping to try something new theyre not attractive the slit stays open with any movement i dont think it would be appropriate for work overall the fit is true to size i otherwise liked the design but the sleeves made this a quick return,0
6145,Im in love with siyu i saw this jacketcape and the brilliant colors drew me in i had to have it im so glad i purchased it it is wonderful i would say that the colors are a bit more muted than in the puctures but still a brilliant statement piece i was considering getting the sleeveless golden mock turtleneck to go with it but glad i didnt the neck of the jacket comes up fairly high and it probably wouldnt have shown the wool material is very fine not scratchy and a bit stretchy,1
6146,I absolutely love this top it has a very classy look and can be used casual or dressy i get lots of compliments,1
6147,Classy pants that can look casual or sophisticated my husband loves them on me for a dinner out i dressed them up with a top from retailer i think these will be a must on my trip to florida this winter since the pants will look great with a t,1
6148,Love how breezy this shirt is and adds unique texture detailing to your outfit the simple black color is a nice touch so the color does not compete with the detailing,1
6149,Yes as much as id have liked this to be a true red its kind of redorange i am relieved however that it is not as orange as it looks on my monitor that is my only slightand i mean slightdisappointment in this cuteasallgetout skirt i am lbs and the six is perfect leading me to believe that this is tts it is a polyester mix with a samecolor liner large buttons followed by smaller silver colored buttons at the apron the larger buttonholes are red and white striped and t,1
6150,Im pounds and bought the xs in white i actually wear this as a bathing suit coverup instead of a top i love that its little longer in the back so it covers part of the back of my thighs its light weight cool and comfortable it is thin but has washed well with no pilling or holes so far ive worn this several times and have had lots of compliments,1
6151,I wanted this immediately after seeing it in the catalog i couldnt wait for it to get to my store so i ordered it and it did not disappoint it is extremely flattering on my hourglass figure the pattern and colors are amazing the unlined lower half does not bother me i will be wearing this with a denim jacket light sweater wedges then booties in the fall i fell like this dress will be able to be worn for years to come,1
6152,This is wearable avantgarde fashion yes the swing is oversizedits supposed to be thats the design fits perfect at arms and across the chest im and orders a p its perfection just understand what youre buying high fashion high quality,1
6153,I absolutely love this dress i feel its the perfect yearround piece looks super cute with boots or booties even with a cute baggy sweater over it i am usually a small or medium depending on brand im a small with this one and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back it just worked better that way it is not seethru though is a light material i live in fl so i can wear year round but up north with tights and boots you can too so worth the price,1
6154,Love this top such a fun pattern and style soft too easily paired with a sweater or light weight denimcargo jackets for fall i generally wear an xs in retailer tops and purchased this in a which is a perfect fit it could be a tad more roomy in the chest however the would be too big overall,1
6155,I already have some dresses similar to this but i couldnt help getting this one too i love the flowers bees and ladybugs on the print there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots i think i can wear this at work with the right cardiganjacket so ill get more use out of it its a lovely light floaty fabric thats nice for warmer weather,1
6156,This top was surprisingly very flattering it hugged my curves in just the right way and the slits on the side are a nice touch im and about a c and the xs was tight in a good way around my chest and then more flowy after soft material and the red color is beautiful,1
6157,Based on the strength of the other reviews i thought this sweater would be amazing but i was disappointed the knit is very thin cheap looking and weak that it wont last a season undamaged it reminds me of a duster i bought years ago at a discount fastfashion retailer when i was a student sloppy looking with lots of creases out of the package collar is odd and the sleeve openings have an annoying flare the drape is not structured enougheverything about this screams over priced bath,0
6158,This caught my eye purely by accident as i was in the dressing room immediately attracted to the pattern the color the quality and the shape of the skirt lo and behold it turned out to be maeve one of my favorite designers at retailer this skirt does not disappoint at all i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase but this is well worth the full retail price the skirt is very well made the material is structured but not stiff i also dont normally like high waisted ski,1
6159,This top looks so pretty on the model however the photo is deceiving as the bottom section is quite wide and loose i am petite but between a c to d cup the top is not really fitted so my bust pushed the top out and made it look like a maternity piece from the side it hung way in front of my body i am wondering if this is clipped in the back on the model if you are smaller chested and taller this top might look nice on you i am lbs and cd cup i really loved the fabric and c,0
6160,First saw this jacket in the catalog in peach and had to have it i received it today and love it its a soft muted peach very neutral i ordered xl im usually a ml but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy the quality is great feels good on love it so much i just ordered it in the dark grey very classic jacket will wear for years one of my favorite hei hei pieces never disappoints,1
6161,The photos shown here really do not do this bomber jacket justice the colors of the embroidery are much deeper and richer in person it is very well made having no loose threads whatsoever the retailer store where i bought mine featured this jacket over an ivory color lace blouse and it looked much more stunning than over the darker color that they show it here with it does run true to size as the other reviewer mentioned too i took my usual size large i would say that if youre betwe,1
6162,As the previous reviewer stated this skirt is a stunner can be worn in all four season its long and runs on the larger side so that you compare im and it goes all the way to the side of my foot im lbs waist hips and always a medium on maeve this skirt on a medium was too big for me at least a size larger take that into account when ordering other than that its a great purchase cant wait for my exchange to arrive,1
6163,I bought this online in dark green after trying on the burgundy i usually wear a medium but i looked better in the small in this jacket the combination of very deep green black and tan is beautiful the cut is very flattering with the jacket open or snapped closed it is nice enough to wear with black pants or skirt but looks just as good with jeans i am in my s and this look is chic and fresh without being too young for my age its also very well made i love it,1
6164,Ive been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together always intending to remove the tack i love it the fabric is super soft i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist its amazing with the tack in it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned so its not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack wear something un,1
6165,Love this tunic its super comfy cute i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint looks great with jeans and boots,1
6166,This tank in black is nice quality most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well its just too short and too boxy for my figure curvyhips would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted since that doesnt describe me it has to go back,0

6168,This shirt is so soft and very flattering i ordered the navy in a medium lbs love how it scoops in the back,1
6169,I tried on this dress in the portland me store today so much good to say about it the wine color is deep and rich the fabric hand is similar to a heavy weight silk the cut of the dress so flatteringbut i didnt get it i am and weigh lbs i can sometimes wear a medium but my upper arms and hips can require a large usually petite for proper length the store didnt have a large i didnt even realize the dress also came in petite so i tried on a medium nice fit through the,1
6170,I ordered a medium as the large in the store was a bit too big i wore this dress to a casual dinner at the grill in the country club and felt so cute but also comfortable i think it is a flattering dress shape and fabric looks just like pictured on your website,1
6171,I bough this in the blue green color and its absolutely beautiful just as it appears online actually the shirt in general looks just like it does online its fitted up top and flowy everywhere else this may be because im fairly straightfigured its possible it would be less flattering on a bigger bust i agree with the other reviewers who say the fabric wrinkles too easily i am sometimes an xs and sometimes a s and i ordered the s in this and like how it fits note in meadow rue,1
6172,Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect material is soft comfortable to wear can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats fits true to size,1
6173,I saw this dress in the store in the coral color and tried it on i am b and slender to athletic build i wear the size in this dress as far as sizes go for retailer i would say it is tts the slip fits like it should and the dress is flowing it is not see through as were some of the other silk dresses this summer it feels so comfortable and makes me feel pretty it is a flowing dress and meant to fit that way i waited for it to go on sale and the day it did i purchased it,1
6174,True to size for petite person bought in blue subtle shading looks great paired with your blue straight leg blue jeans perfect outfit for almost all occasions,1
6175,Wore this to work and nearly everyone complimented me on it very comfortable lots of detailing perfect for fall pockets im usually somewhere between a s and m but this piece was generously cut and a s was perfect i debated ordering the petite but actually the regular cut was the perfect length even though im only,1
6176,Skirt fit perfectly nice construction hidden zipper full lining nicely done would love to see it in navy or black,1
6177,I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath,1
6178,The holding horses brand never ceases to amaze me this dress is gorgeous in person i have received so many compliments while wearing this dress the lace is intracately crafted and the lilac color is perfect i actually have this magnolia dress in black as well and i might even get the new reddish color too needless to say im obsessed with this dress,1
6179,This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on i had to return it because of the poor design it was extremely hard to put on and take off there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material but not worth it if its difficu,0
6180,Cozy soft comfortable a perfect transitional top that bubbles over with personalityits a unique fabric design that makes you feel like youre on vacation love it,1
6181,This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings sundrys lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool the fit is true to size the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along,1
6182,I love this skirt wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so when i saw it was almost sold out in my size which it is now another thing is it doesnt come in petite boohooanyway ordered the smallest size for my in waist didnt have any trouble with the waist being too tight like some other reviewers it fit really well and comfortably sits at the natural waist so the hem isnt too crazy low on me fine for heels would be so cute,1
6183,I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it i received multiple compliments on it i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button im tempted to order the red color,1
6184,I dont usually spend this much on a top but despite the high price i really love the style i like that its made out of cotton and it can be worn down on the shoulders or left up looks cute both ways i ordered the xs which is usually my size it fits perfectly i imagine the s would have fit also it hits just at the hips i have a long torso so i would have liked it a bit longer but its not a deal breaker my one splurge this summerfor reference lbs d,1
6185,I have so many compliments on this blouse i love the style and design i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am tall i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it wont look right in the back kinda hang out otherwise really nice quality blouse i would definitely buy another just to have a back up,1
6186,This top runs a tad big its beautiful in person and sooooo soft definitely an retailer staple top material and cut is great,1
6187,This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on i almost didnt send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front or leave it open great looking casual but stylish and neat a good grey and a good blue,1
6188,This blouse is beautiful and i saw someone wearing it and she looked great i went and bought this to wear for a holiday party and it is not for people with any sort of chest it looked ridiculous on me as the pleats started right at the bra line and caused the blouse to tent out in both directions however looks super cute on those more on the flatchested side,0
6189,I got he green color with gray accent stitching looks awesome with gray tone leggings super soft definitely runs a little big lbs i ordered the small but not in an unflattering way,1
6190,Im and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering i saw it i the store on was drawn to it i love the shimmer but perhaps thats because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc the m fit great in both length pans width it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots i felt it made me look thin thankful i bought it on a discount day its a fabulous sweater,1
6191,Purchased this top in the store on sale love the material very soft and comfortable love the black and white combination i am petite so the top is a great length on me i can see that if you are tall it might be to short,1
6192,This is a beautiful dress not too interested in yellow but needed it for a wedding this summer i usually wear a large but returned it for a medium the large armhole was a little too big super comfortable and easy,1
6193,Nice feminine pattern with a thick fabric its great having pockets the white is ivory im a size and the small fits nicely it would be nice if the pant length was a little longer i have a inseam and they end up being a couple of inches above my ankle but thats just my preference overall very happy with this purchase,1

6196,This dress fits wonderfully i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to great deal as well,1
6197,From the website picture in particular the gray one this may appear to be oversized i can assure you it is not i have to return the small i ordered on the oversize assumption and hope the medium my usual size fits because its a really nice top the sleeves and the pattern of the weave give it good pizzazz,1
6198,I purchased this blouse in black love it this blouse goes with everything from jeans to work to cocktail it is perfect my only wish is that it came in a colors i would add navy red green white im tempted to purchase another one just so i never have to worry about the one i have wearing out buy it you wont be sorry,1

6201,Great blouse for curvy women im always an xl in retailer tops and even then sometimes the xls can be too tight to keep however i was so happily surprised with this blouse the arms are usually an issue for me but the arms in the blouse are perfect and loose in the bicep area this blouse fits beautifully and is really high quality the blouse lays nicely everywhere i plan to wear it with a pair of gray pants so the lace cut out at the bottom shows up more the lace is heavy duty and doesnt,1
6202,Beautiful bohemian maxi that feels like soft woven cottonpoly but its unfortunately viscose the print is as vibrant detailed as expected from hemant nandita color contrast not as bright irl body of dress flares out to an aline after the arm holes and the hem is a shark bite to show off your footwear there is no lining but it doesnt seem see through very relaxed fit that feels tts but if you prefer a slimmer cut and are of slender body habitus size down otherwise if you are busty,1

6214,This is an amazing summer dress so pretty it stood out even though only a few were left on the rack its light airy and perfect even for the hottest summer days the straps are not adjustable but for me the dress was not too low and it fit just like on the model pictured a very thin belt comes with it but adds nothing only detracts i am usually a s or m in retailer sizing and the s was perfect for ref lbs this dress is so flawless and beautiful and i feel wonderful wearing,1

6227,Found this vest in the sale section actually rolled up in a ball on the floor what a great find the colors and texture are rich strong navy blue base with rich other shades and texture yes the vest runs big but if you tie it from the back the bulky look is gone love this way to wear a cocoon cut vest the vest is in a size xssm and on my build works like a typical medium would be perfect for work and lovely with jeans and skirts washable wool blend that is soft with nice structure to,1
6228,Love the colors of this dress it did run a little large i ordered a large and medium and went with the medium,1
6229,This dress does run large but i sized down from med to small and its a great fit the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is and is nicely flowy but might require a slip,1
6230,I am currently studying at a university where i am constantly reviewed on how i dress if im underdressed i get comments and if im overdressed i get even more comments the other day i wore a plain navy blue blazer and people asked me all day what the occasion was for me this blazer is a nice solution to the standard uniform blazer the stripes and light grey color make this blazer more casual for me but i still feel put together for class the fit is also excellent and doesnt feel boxy at,1

6237,Im ft inches lbs this dress fits perfect i bought a r the petite probably would have fit and been a inch or two shorter but i dont the regular looked bad it hits an inch or two below my knee medium thickness of fabric is forgiving even though the dress hugs in all the right places beautiful dress,1

6239,When i saw this sweater online i ordered literally immediately as i was afraid that is would sell withing an houri am shocked that it is not sold outwhen i received it in the mail it is even prettier in personthe pink tulle peplum is actually more of a taupe giving the sweater a more sophisticated lookthe sweater is soft and cozy and the peplum is such a beautiful and elegant touchi wore with silver flats and jeans and wow got so many complimentsruns spot on true to size and is a,1
6240,This top is so pretty i love the lace details and the embroidery which really makes this top something special its true that it is on the shorter side but that seems to be an intentional aspect of the style i didnt find it to be too short sitting well below my waist line im i usually wear a medium in retailer clothes and this top is no exception it fit perfectly i know this will be one piece i wear quite often,1
6241,Just got this and i havent taken it off all night i feels like lounge wear but is so cute and works with heels or flats throw a necklace on a nice scarf or a jacket and dress it up for going out it looks exactly like the picture and fits true to size i will get a lot of use out of this piece for spring and summer nothing is better than something that feels like pjs but looks so stylish,1
6242,I was so excited to get this in the mail and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel i dont know why it looks like a normal length on the model im returning it,0
6243,Beautiful sweater i love the color and the fit the cowl neck isnt too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy it comes down to the low hip on me very soft and cozy i purchased the aqua in xs fits perfectly and im lbs,1
6244,I am so happy with this dress i bought my usual size and it was a perfect fit this dress is gorgeous it has some stretch which is a plus i am and it was not too long on me at all i am so thrilled with my purchase,1
6245,I highly recommend this top i am busty and was concerned that it might not be flattering but i find it flattering i also dont have the greatest arms so i wore a crisp white top underneath see my pics below hides any tummy pooch and is so flattering runs tts i ordered a small im lbs the petite might have been too short for my taste dont hesitate,1
6246,I was so excited to get this in the mail and so disappointed when i put it on it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up but i dont really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror lumpiness along the seams i dont know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not but it gave me lumpylooking hips and then kind of clung around my midthigh area returned it the next day,0
6247,I really love this piece because its classic and the style transitions from daytonight the color caught my eye first but once i tried it on it was knotting the tie in front and seeing the elegant texture it created down each pant leg that sold me i felt too comfortable to be stylish but there i was multitasking my fulltime passions in the retailer dressing room no big deal i am a tall size woman for taller girls like me who a intend to wear a small heel with the piece,1
6248,I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me but so far i have been unsuccessful i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well togetheraside from the peplum issue this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large the material alone is thick making it a bulkier shirt then add the volume of the peplum and i looked and felt huge needless to say this one was returned sale or no sale,0
6249,This is such a beautiful dress but have to return for the reasons others have noted the chest does not fit well,0
6250,This dress looks better in person the shape is pretty much straight but fits nicely even if you are curvier it doesnt show your imperfections the type blue and white color is nice but a bit see through on the bottom and the slip is a little short came to about mid thigh for me so i would wear leggings underneath i dont think a belt would look good with this because of the shape and if you have curves very cool summer style,1
6251,I got this shirt in a medium my normal retailer size and while the short fit the front is cropped i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back however this was just too short in the front my belly button was exposed and that wasnt the look displayed on the model unfortunately this top is going back to the store,0
6252,I tried this on in the store all of the dresses in the store were misshapen and pulled long in the armholes and i love all of my local retailer stores i dont think these should be hung on a hanger the knit is too heavy for hanging the hem on the dress i tried in the store was dirty from dragging on the floor i went home and ordered it online with the dress discount and free shipping the dress i received was clean unstretched in the armholes and not oddly short like some review,1
6253,Love this blouse and stunning color the ruffles make it special and different,1
6254,Wow this is huge im all for the tentlook with the right style but this was absurd i could have fit two of me into the width and with the peplum style extra width doesnt flatter anyone the fabric is also so thin that it doesnt hang nicely it kind of floats around the body if you want a wide top then this is perfect but if you wanted something that hangs nicely look elsewhere i purchased a petite s my typical size,0
6255,This dress looks amazing on it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat the black outlined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress my only issue is that the dress ran very small,1
6256,I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and havent found one i really liked againuntil now great quality just heavy enough but not too heavy just stretchy enough but not too stretchy great colordesign no complaints i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago which is a big endo,1
6257,Im a lb shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me othewise it looks a little too boxy the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely similar to the model in the pink i had a sweater with this exact silhouette years ago and wore it to death even though i,1
6258,This top is really great for the summer the fabric is light and gauzy so its perfect for hot days i dont like to wear a cami in the summer and this shirt does not require one when worn with a nude bra i love the window pane pattern and the light pink color is very flattering and subtle im lb with fairly broad shoulders and wear either a small or medium i ordered the medium in this shirt and found it a bit large so the small would have worked as well i would say that your re,1
6259,These run so small i was dissapointed with having to return my pair im hoping they are replenished back in stock so i can get the proper size,1
6260,Im assuming the model showing the sweater is at least it is slightly cropped on her but it certainly doesnt look super cropped im and its super cropped on me even with high waist jeansalso it is incredibly itchy i even tried it with a cami under but the itchy wool came right through the camitoo bad its a cute design just needs some tweaking,0
6261,I originally bought the white lace version of this dress but it felt too bridey then i snagged all three of the velvet blazers and spotted this black version i like that it is not all lace with the pleated chiffon center the under slip is straight and fits with the outer layer sheer enough to give the appearance of there being a shape under the flow it is so versatile as i can do it with the velvet blazers and booties or classic lbd with black pumps well worth the price as this will f,1
6262,Beware there is a reason this sweater is on sale it is not even remotely the same color as pictured instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo this sweater is a faded boring tealgreen what a huge disappointment,0
6263,Unfortunately this one is going back the fit is very flattering and the underlying layer is very revealing in the back,0
6264,The petites fit perfect these are so comfortable i will get much us out of them,1
6265,This shirt smelled so bad when i received it and i am not at all sensitive to smells is it from the dye i tried it on anyway it is shapeless and nothing special at almost bucks it is so over priced,0
6266,This sweater feels good and not itchy at all im long waisted and the small hit right at my hip bonetop of my lowwaisted jeans so its kinda on the shorter side i liked it that way bc its not baggy at the bottom and is figure flattering i tied the tie twice and thought it looked better i have long arms and was excited the sleeves go down to the middle of my hands it has little hole detailing down the middle but not so much that youd have to wear a shirt underneath,1
6267,I am in love with this suit i got the white floral its beautiful and classy it feels like great quality too i am going to get the black color too when its back in stock i am and about lbs dd and im wearing a medium i got both the small and medium and decided to keep the medium it does have more fabric with the medium but the bigger size covers my chest and bigger bottom,1
6268,The sweater could be really pretty but it is huge i ordered the xss and it was swimming on me its too bad because the stitching was beautiful but this item is going back,0
6269,Love the rushed sleeves and the flower pattern on the side t shirt is however a little thin hence a bit sheer but i loved it nonetheless i saw the loose fit and decided ot order a size down xxs petite ad it is so flattering going to keep it as i dont think petite is going to make it to sale i think it will look very cute with my denim pencil skirt jeans or other pants for casual days,1
6270,These pants are my favorite not only is the fit slimming and perfect but i get compliments on the design every single time i wear them i absolutely love these well worth the money,1
6271,I like the edge of this dress and it balances my narrower hips well im usually between p and p in retailer dresses and xxsp definitely fit better on my frame armpits and kneelength where it should belove that its machine washable and unusual super soft and beautiful color even though i normally gravitate to cooler colorsbring it on everleigh,1
6272,I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist it is very comfortable and made of a nice soft fabric i am a a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i dont find the neckline too low i plan to wear it with tights and booties i am and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress,1
6273,Beautiful pink top comfortable love the color and print style and sleeves good quality didnt have the issues with the placement of the bees over my breasts that other reviewers did the bees were at the sides of my breasts covered my butt for the most part in jeans flattering cut i got an xs b,1
6274,I love charlie pants ive bought a few in the past and ive never been disappointed with quality style or fit i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result i wish more pants were side zip so much more flattering than having that part stick out under fitted shirts i got these in a my usual size and while they fit a little more snugly than my other size charlie pants there is enough stretch that they dont look or feel too tight i also got these in the regular r,1
6275,This shirt is so stunning the photo does this shirt no justice what you cant see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt they run verticallyand are very subtle and seen only up close so pretty also the detail in the chest area is perfect i love this shirt,1
6276,These pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties i am with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green red and gray my go to pants this winter,1
6277,The embroidery on this dress is beautiful in person perfect dress for fall,1
6278,I do wish this came in a dd sizing purchased he d and it fits though the band is looser than desired i am still keeping it i love the back will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear recommend,1
6279,Love i was super hesitant to try this dress on it didnt look great online or on the hanger but it looked great on it has a very bohosvintage feel i am curvy and it looked fabulous,1
6280,Beautiful shorts make you feel like a million dollars love love love themthe robe to match is also adorable,1
6281,I love elosie sleepwear everything is well made and beautiful designs i am and wear a size the small fits great i love the embroidery it is a nice touch and the pink is a pretty contrast,1
6282,Fits true to size i am a size and it fit perfectly nice quality fits like a glove,1
6283,Ive been searching for a brown topdresstunic forever and i finally found the perfect one i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size small i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store its sooo soft and has a beautiful riblike patterntexture to it you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tightsleggings,1
6284,This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling the material looks very nice and seems well made it has a nice length to it so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry im a d and cant get the button to close properly so id recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you overall it will be a very versitile piece im excited to add to my wardrobe,1
6285,This is such a fun dress the linen and cotton mixture is very unique and comfortable for reference i am and about pounds the regular xs hits me exactly the way it is shown in the photo the color is a true oatmeal which is so nice for fall and even though i am fair with strawberry blonde hair it doesnt wash me out the sleeves are a little long but i rolled them once and it is perfect i love this dress and it will look great with booties or boots for the fall,1
6286,Dress is made from a lightweight linen and is lined with a separate slip high quality with nice details and tts sleeves are average length length of dress feels appropriate on my frame hookandeye closure at chest area to keep buttons aligned is a quality detail i think this is a lovely dress that can go from work to play,1
6287,They have some stretch so if you are between sizes order down they are very long which for me is a good thing,1
6288,This has great drape length the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck so not sure if i will keep though i dont seem to want to take it off has a lightweight boiled wool texture contrasting print and design so cool,1
6289,Im glad i listened to the other reviewersi ordered a large instead of my usual medium its roomy enough for a sweater underneath i love the denim its very soft and has some stretch my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing i also love the darker denim,1
6290,Its like a work of art but sadly not flattering on me i absolutely loved the look and even considered taking it to a tailor but the material overall is very stiff if youre teeny tiny and need something to give you the illusion of hips you might love it very sad to return this,0
6291,These jeans have been the best pair of jeans i have ever worn you could practically sleep in them they are so comfortable brushed softness and stretch easily they hug your body in a flattering way that these jeans are worth the money spent as youll have them for a while,1
6292,This dress is gorgeous in person soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing i bought at size which was two sizes smaller than my normal size in retailer dresses i have worn twice and each time random strangers have complimented it it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow expensive maybe but well worth it,1
6293,Perfect fit this dress is super flattering the crisscrossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty the perfect spring to summer dress,1
6294,I purchased this skirt on a whim as an option for the up and coming hoiday party season and was plesantly surprised it is very well madea medium weight taffita material and best of all it has pockets i just love the combination of colors in the skirt navy blue grey and ecru stripe i paired the skirt with a taylored white dress shirt and statement necklace for a classic look but also imagine it combined with a dressy tshirt cut as well buy it while you can,1
6295,This top is so cute i love it and get tons of compliments on it,1
6296,Love this preppy sweater for fall only detail i wasnt crazy about was the deep slits in the sides it gapes a little oddly then around the pocket but not enough of a distraction for me to send it back,1
6297,This looks beautiful and fits truetosize the material has enough weight so that it hangs well this is a very formfitting dress i wouldnt recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style,1
6298,And this one proved to be no different the short end of it this dress is pretty much super thick heavy linen with a rope like collar the supposed embroidery you see and there is no lining but completely unnecessary pockets im typically a or depending on the designer a super fit lbs and knew enough to order an xs in this however it still fit like a potato sack even upon taking it out of the plastic bag i knew it was going back between the unrealistic pictures and lack,0
6299,I love these jeans they are super soft and just the right weight for year around however they do run large i normally wear a size i am and weigh s because the other reviewers mentioned the sizing issue i ordered a size down they were too large and i sent them back for an exchange these are perfect i get tons of compliments when i wear themi would love to see coh make them in a true black,1
6300,Im a big ag fan so i was excited to receive these for my birthday i really love everything about them but boy were they long even with a inch heeled boot i was stepping on the hem im so i dont often have to get things hemmed but that was a must with these jeans i recommend these jeans but unless youre foot tall plan on running them to the tailors,1
6301,I love the color of this skirt and the fabric is wonderful it was a bit longer than anticipated but fit well,1
6302,Yes this is a thinner bra its almost sheer when you hold it up to the light but it fit perfectly d and is seamless under even the thinnest tops i love that its not padded i feel like it just slightly enhances my natural shape without adding anything more and i really wish i had bought multiples before they sold out i cant speak to how it will hold up since i just got it yesterday and im wearing it for the first time today but im keeping my fingers crossed that it will last as wel,1
6303,Love this top the lace detailing on it is gorgeous and fits tts however the length does run a bit short not crop top short but it is shorter than i expected and im s short personthe color is listed as white and as pictured it also looks white but its not its definitely an ivory color i bought a white camisole to wear under it and when the top arrived the tank didnt match the top,1
6304,For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is flattering without being skintight it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra the vneck is low and is the same in the back great length super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra i havent washed this yet but based on other reviews ill probably hand wash and air dry the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then,1
6305,I was worried the green might be on the shiny side but its not its a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous like in other tiny tops this top runs small so order up a size in most of retailer tops im a small or medium but in this i take a large a perfect fit im a c is a little on the pricey side but got on sale so all smiles here,1
6306,So soft that i bought in colors i love wearing them it is comfortable yet tailored i highly recommend,1
6307,I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real lifenot on a model but tired it on in store and it looks great it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place just the right thickness not too thin or thick i am lb b and got the xs i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great im always either an xs or s with retailer tops blue is definitely more steel interesting piece will not disappointed,1
6308,After reading the reviews i ordered this dress in an xs and sp im and lbs the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest the sp fits perfectly im wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions,1
6309,Long thin tunic perfect over leggings great for casual day but look pulled together,1
6310,I had this on my wish list as soon as it came in i just bought it last week and im so glad i did i bought the purple print and it is really pretty here in northern cal i can wear this almost year round i am often right between sizes when it comes to deletta tops this one is a little bit big im hoping that the extra room will help keep it cool during our degree days,1
6311,I ordered this in a size which i thought would be a small and it was very very wide it is very short too i typically wear a small and am and lbs its going back unfortunately very soft material though,0
6312,True to size so great fit from top to bottom i am and it hits my hips at just the right spot not too high or too low it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area it is very soft and comfortable the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing,1
6313,Ive been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughters first birthday party since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it it does drape nicely,1
6314,I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorabletrue to size and nice lengththe black and white is kind of a throwback to the s flower power era and really cutenice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material more like a crepevery nice,1
6315,Soft pretty design and perfect length im and the m fit perfectly,1
6316,I bought this top in a size im with a longer torso i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up the material is on the thicker side so its a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic,1
6317,Eyelash sweaters are all so soft and cuddly but this is the only one ive found what doesnt make me look like a bear the shoulder cutouts really help create a flattering silhouette im the medium fits well slightly loose so the sleeve below the cut out hangs slightly highly recommend,1
6318,Unforgiving to even your smallest imperfections,0
6319,The designshape of the dress are quite flattering flirty and feminine but there is no way that the dress i received is new the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area there is no tag the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp stiff or new i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received undoubtedly this one is going backdear retailer please make sure that you do not send preowend clothing articles to,0
6320,My vshape figure broad shoulder narrow hips waist not well defined looked completely square in this not flattering at all perhaps better for other figures,0
6321,lbs d normally size i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did it is very flattering on my curvy frame it does run a big big so i sized down to a instead of my normal size the top is still a tad bit big as another commented not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldnt wear it to work without a cami under it over all i love this dress its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty i bought the orange motif,1
6322,Morher jeans are my favourite they are soft and fit great make my saggy butt look good they do stretch with wears but shrink again in the wash they do shrink quite a bit so dont dry all the way i recommend mother to all,1
6323,I thought this was a fun piece to have but didnt realize how versatile it was until i got home and started mixing it with either casual shoes or dressing it up with fancier accessoriesi love this jumpsuitit is well made and the fabric is of a quality that lends itself to both casual and dressy,1
6324,This sweater sold out fast at my local retailer store you know that stuffed animal that you owned when you were a kid and you would never let it go because it was so soft and snuggly yeah it is like that for me its a bit pilly but thats what sweaters do size petite s fit me perfectly i am ftin b waist hips hem falls inches above my knees sleeves fall right at my wrist and it gives room for wearing a sweater or turtleneck under it hood lays flat horse print is so cute,1
6325,Yep absolutely tickled to death with this top light airy cotton poplin with personality plus such an aesthetically pleasing piece i havent been this pleased with an article of clothing in some time this blouse speaks to mei am lbs and the size eight was a tad largemight have gotten a six but this is fine it is very blousy on the bottom but when it speaks to me it says belt or tuck anyway the neckline is just too much it gives such personality to the piece the open ne,1
6326,I have been looking for an offwhite vest and thought this one would be perfect except it is going back i am lbs medium is my normal top size but this medium was tight even though the design looks relaxed in the picture no buttons so no way to close it unlined and the design and fabric look more casual than the photo not worth the price,0
6327,This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesnt look anything like that in reality it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive,0
6328,I noticed this top as i was going into the fitting room and tried it on on impulse i was pleasantly surprised with the fit and soft quality of the fabric and even more impressed with the price i usually like my tops very fitted and found this one hung loose but not boxy i have been wearing it quite a bit sometimes with a camisole underneath and sometimes not i bought the one with the flowers and it is not seethrough and the light fabric is good for our warm heat i bought my usual s,1
6329,This top is totally adorable its one of my favorite retailer tops this season i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable,1
6330,Love this top the lace pattern is gorgeous and the detail at the neck and sleeves make it a little more casual its completely sheer so you do need a white tank or shell underneath the top is on the shorter side but definitely not a crop im c and b and got a small fits great and pairs well with black pants and heeled booties,1
6331,Comfy easy dress i bought the black version fabric is so soft i wear this around house but dont hesitate to run out in it if needed i bought medium so it was roomier and for length since im tall small also fit but was shorter than i wanted,1
6332,This is a gorgeous high quality blouse the color is stunning in person i dont have anything like this color in my wardrobe im an xl in retailer tops and purchased this blouse in a i am busty but the top still fit well i have large upper arms but the sleeves fit fine i wish they were a bit looser but that is my personal preference and probably doesnt apply to most people if youre very thin and not busty you might be able to size down but im honestly just not sure im happy to say,1
6333,After reading the reviews i was a little afraid of the fit before the dress arrived having ordered it online it is a darling dress i am big busted d and it fit just fine also it has an cute attached slip so i didnt find it see through the color is gorgeous i chose the blue and it will be perfect for summer no problem at all with the armholes,1
6334,I really love this pant ordered online and they fit well theyre cute edgy with the fray at the bottom corduroy material awesome,1
6335,Great lightweight blouse for mild fall days fabric is thin so not too warm which is great for southern california fall great color palate,1
6336,I love these pants only wish they i was a little taller im and the small is a little long for me,1
6337,I agree with another reviewer that these are not ankle jeans however even as regular jeans they fit great and the color is lovely and very versatile i normally need to have my jeans hemmed but the length on these is perfect for my frame,1
6338,I have nothing but positive comments to say about this sweater im pounds and i got a medium because my shoulders are a bit wide and my sweater fits me just as it does the model its not bulky but it is very warm and the colors are out of this world a very high quality and unusual piece that will be in my wardrobe for many years,1
6339,This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional,1
6340,I am lb and i usually wear a or in tops because i dont like clothing too tight on top i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained now i wish i could be more please bring this back retailer,1
6341,This dress fit so oddly i tried on two different sizes and both did this super unflattering poochy thing at the belly the dress wasnt tight at my hips in either size it was just that there was weird extra fabri right around the midsection that stuck out maybe i was too short couldnt figure it out the color and detailing are beautiful though a little tight in the bust,0
6342,This is one of the best purchases ive ever made i have had the black for over a year and every time i wear it i receive so many complements ive dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt or a fitted sweater and paired it with flannel with a belt i love it im ft and slender and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee i recently ordered the silver in a small its a little big in the waist but nothing a corset belt cant help for nye love this dress,1
6343,I just purchased this at my local retailerthe online pix does not do it justice so pretty delicatecasual comfortable fittinghits right at the hips,1
6344,Love this top im lbs purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress it is so cute,1
6345,I was expecting a tee shirt but the material is more of light sweater knit in the end it wasnt the fabric that was the deal breakerit was the fit in my regular size it is too wide and boxy through the body i also felt like the arms are too big as well its going back and i am not going to bother ordering it in a smaller size its a shame because the embroidery really is lovely,0
6346,I got this in the brown and absolutely love it this is perfect for cool weather im super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint,1

6348,Read other reviews was worried about neckline being tight went with size of last dress i bought from retailer s perfect cant wait to wear this dress got it in the black white polka dot plan to layer with capri legging,1
6349,This sweater was a big let down i am so i ordered it in a petite it was so short that if i lifted my arms youd see my bra there is no way i could wear it without something under it even with high waisted bottoms and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic the entire sleeve is just wide and it continues with little increase into the cuff it is just short and boxy it is going back for sure,0
6350,I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my frame my daughter loved it so she scored i ordered another one in xs perfect though the sleeves run long i have long arms can be dressy or casual,1
6351,I purchased this early in summer and have worn it a lot you can dress it up or down and since its comfortable you will want to wear it a lot i can wear it for everything from walking the dog to going out to dinner i bought jumpsuits this summer and this is by far my favorite the fit is flattering fitted but not tight and the selftie belt gives your waist definition so the overall look is hourglass i am tall and i normally take an xs or s i went with the s to ensure that it was long,1
6352,Super cute with skinny jeans true to size im size pounds and c got a small,1
6353,Lovely at a the size small was a great fit moss color is really quite grey drapes beautifully and is an easy wear,1
6354,Other than the color i got the rose color which is great i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough i am and the sleeves come right to my wrists if not just a tad longer onto my hands its also got some stretch to it so it doesnt make you feel to stiff as you wear it you can move in it its very comfortable and pretty,1
6355,I was really eager to receive this sweater i was expecting the same as in the picture i received it today and i am already returning it first of all the sweater didnt look new it is mostly shapeless it has little balls and piling on the wool what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months and the metallic color makes it look cheap in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col,0

6357,I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play highly recommend,1
6358,I had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews first off it runs really small i usually wear a small or medium or i couldnt even get the on i probably could have even done a the fabric was extremely flimsy i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off other than the sizing and the fabric it just wasnt flattering on me,0
6359,Love this dark gray heathered blazer no stripes contrary to its name very easy to wear with the bit of spandex and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters sleeve length perfect even with sweater on will get lots of wear with this dressup or dressdown piece,1

6365,Cute top great for the inner maid marian fan fun twist on tshirt in regular size also ordered the alexandria top in somewhat similar vein but didnt care for that one at all this one was cute and the fit is flattering the other is boxy and boring to me recommend this one,1
6366,Absolutely love as others have mentioned its super comfy and the colors in the bottom definitely brighten up the sweater the online brand says monogram but the tag says sleeping on snowweird,1
6367,I was afraid the twist at the front would be too bulky but it adds a nice extra touch to an otherwise simple shirt i got it in the blue and the color is beautiful a basic piece with a little bit more very happy,1
6368,This is a great coat very lightweight but warm the color is gorgeous it is fitted at the waist with fullness below and a great length i am writing this review to give a heads up about the sizing by usual retailer sizing this runs small and short waisted i am generally an retailer x small and i need to exchange this one for a small or maybe even a medium if i want to wear much underneath it as it is it fits too well like a dress not a coat and looks short waisted in fact when i tr,1
6369,I really wanted to love this dress i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors and thought that the green color would be perfect it is well made but the fabric is lighter than expected the biggest issues was the size i am and typically a size ten i ordered the ten and it fit like a it was huge if you order this i would say size down two sizes,0

6372,After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly the style of the top is unique and flattering now that i see even more colors ill need to buy more my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin so i hope it doesnt get holes i want to wear this one all summer,1

6374,I usually do not buy dresses at full price but when i saw the teal version of this dress on the website i caved in and bought it i had also tried the pink version of this dress in store its very cute and sweet but i dont think i can pull it off the teal version is pretty accurate in color to the on screen imagethis dress runs huge i usually wear a or in retailer dresses and went with a size for this one it fits comfortably without being too baggy or like a tent the materi,1
6375,I love this dress the colors are eye catching if flows nicely,1
6376,Lightweight soft cotton top and shorts i think its meant to be a beach coverup but im wearing it as a thin lightweight summer outfit on these hot hot days the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didnt realize when i ordered it but i like it and it matches the look in the photos and the shorts are very lowcut dont expect them up around your waist again i like that some might want to wear a cami underneath because its a thin cotton but im fine asis i bought it i,1
6377,I got this dress in the mail today and really thought i was going to love it the color is a beautiful rich red which was a nice surprise i was expecting more of a dusty red from the picture love the fabric soft and appears to be good quality the length is perfect hit right at my knees size small the flow of the dress is great as well the ultimate flaw would be the arm and neck holes the neck hole was choking me but yet a little loose at the back of the neck almost like it was on,0
6378,This dress has a very flattering cut for hourglass ladies i am an and got the medium the sleeves are a little blousy otherwise it is just about perfect it will look great with boots or booties for fall i will wear a thin tank with it to work because the neckline is a little deep,1
6379,I was a little hesitant to order this dress due to the cottonpolyester blendnot generally a fan of poly for summer it is high quality though very soft lightweight and lays beautifully its not see through either which seems like a rare find in clothing lately the embroidery is very well done too and i think it adds just the right touch of feminine while not being overly precious it does run small by a whole size which ive found to be typical of eva franco dresses i am usually a,1
6380,Love this sweater bought it in pink and grey and it looks great with jeans great quality and true to size,1

6385,I loved this top online and even more when i opened it up however the quality of the stitching is poor where the seam comes together at the hip on both sides the stitching is very loose and appears to be coming undone i was bummed and am sending it back today,0
6386,Retailer has done it again i love this top i purchased it for our engagement photos i am typically a small or medium and decided to size down for this one i purchased a small and it fit perfectly its not near as long as it is in the photo which pleased me i did read about busty ladies having a problem with the fit and i can definitely see how that would be an issue,1

6408,This skirt is really cute and versatile it can be dressed up or down i paired it with a black chiffon top for a dressed up look and a denim button down for a casual look the length is good and the buckles allow it to be tightened which is a plus if you have an athletic body,1
6409,This capeponcho item is totally amazing from the moment it whispered over my head as it slipped past my hair i knew i had to have it this piece is magical it feels like youre wearing a blanket the warmth factor but the length is so perfect that it doesnt overwhelm you nor does it make you look like a tank the colors are amazingly saturated and the quality is so worth the price the model is wearing it with light brown but i tried it on over black leggings in the store and it works w,1

6416,This top is so gorgeous the color the embroidery the neckline are all perfect this can be worn casually with jeans or dressed up for a special occasion i wore this to a thanksgiving part but also to take final exams in because it is comfy too this piece definitely runs small i ordered a large despite being a medium in almost everything else at retailer and the fit is perfect,1
6417,I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations it literally pairs great with everything fall chokers boots dresses you name it it also fits very true to size not too fit to your body and a little loose but not too loose just like a bomber jacket should i highly recommend this product,1
6418,I initially saw this top a few months ago and fell in love it ended up selling out in stores so i ordered it online where it was backordered by a couple of months i received it this past week and was sadly disappointed the design is pretty but overall the quality is sorely lacking i wonder if maybe the first batch was good but when they realized they were so popular and had more made the newer batches werent as good not sure the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery and ther,0

6420,I bought this at the retailer store the other day and i wore it to work and i received so many complements it has the perfect amount of swing and hides your middle without looking frumpy i got the blue color and wore it with skinny jeans and ankle boots the red is really more of a bight pink color not a rich red as pictured i wish it came in more colors and patternsmaybe green or purple it does run big i usually take a large but a medium was perfect,1
6421,This is a simple shirt but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer im ordering one in the blue and white as well i know this is going to be a fave i love supima cotton and though i adore retailer i do wish theyd carry more of the supima rather than the nonorganic fabrics so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy because i prefer the feel of silk linen and cotton thanks for this one retailer,1
6422,I usually buy xs or s in retailer clothing and the pieces usually fit perfectly this time i purchased my first petite item because i was worried the length of the pant leg would fall at an unusual spot if i didnt im and i ordered a petite small i was swimming in it the elastic in the back was so loose you could see directly down my pants i wanted to love this but unfortunately the size did not work for me,0
6423,Purchased this in the burnt orange color very nicewill be lightweight for our hot humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up frontthe slip is nicely made with strap attachments in the shoulders so they do not slipi wear a ton of dresses in the summer so this will definitely be a go to item for all the horse races we attend looking forward to snagging a nice derby style hat to match,1
6424,I am curvy and wear a size and these pants look amazing often i struggle with wide keg pants bc they make me look short and plump however the material is buttery soft and hang in an elegant way and most important they are quite flattering even if you dont think culottes will work for your body type i suggest you give these a try,1

6427,I just received this in the mail today first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer the description says viscose lining so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color second of all it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said i ordered a size smaller than us,0
6428,Another cloth and stone success love the back denim goes with most anything,1
6429,This dress hits all of the high notes for me it is crisp elegant and it looks like something a european coutour designer would create i am so glad i have this dress in my wrardrobe it hits me just above the knee which is super flattering wear this to a fancy party when you want to look feminine and classy it is a dress that will serve you for a lifetime,1
6430,I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person the fabric is a rough gauzy texture the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something they do not hang or move well on the body also they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off sadly these are going back,0
6431,I tried on this sweaterlove the flowing top and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustlinewrongthe seam came right across my bust on a medium sized up to a large same thing this shouldnt happen not sure who this would actually flatterthe sweater is high quality and the colors are perfect the fit needs work,0
6432,I love this shirt its easy to belt i just wish it was tighter,1
6433,This is an amazing dress it did stretch out a little so although i got the large i probably couldve gotten the medium beautiful feel fully lined on the really hot days this is what i grab and i stay cool all day i get so many compliments on this dress the colors are gorgeous,1

6435,Fun and elegantthis cape is my favorite purchase in a long time the juxtaposition of the black and red body against the grey faux fur collar is stunning it has brass detail snaps up and down both sides as well as at the generous pockets at natural length on both sides it is very well made of good quality materials as all tracey reese pieces have been in my experienceit does run true to size as it is an oversized piece which adds to its classy dramatic flare it is comfortable to wear,1
6436,This is the th pair of ag stevie jeans i have bought from retailer the petite sizing fit me great im and lbs the quality is fabulous and worth the price i have denim white and just purchased these dark wave i went to the ag store and they do not carry petities this jean is made exclusively for retailer love them,1
6437,I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy the shirt was pretty much square and the top was super itchy too looks so cute online but nogo in person,0
6438,This dress is absolutely gorgeous the top portion fit a little smaller than the typical size i order the zip side was a little snug but the fit is very flattering the lace detail and belted design are very pretty the skirt portion has more volume than i tend to like but it is it beautiful,1

6441,I loved this dress the moment i saw it online and debated ordering it as i wasnt sure the color would work on my pale skin but wow so pretty it fits like s glove in fact i almost had a hard time zipping the side where the fabric changes the tie waist in a beautiful addition the chest seems roomy enough i am a dd and the petite fit it is surplice so may give more if bigger chested the skirt is a kind of lace and looks pleated at the same time my only complaint is the side zipper i,1
6442,The print is even better in person true to size flattering fit,1
6443,Comfortable flattering one step up in formality from jammies what more could you want,1
6444,Tried on today this dress has the most soft dreamy fabric ive ever felt unfortunately for me strapless dresses are not flattering on me but for anyone looking for the perfect summer strapless this is it i am sad that it didnt work for me,1
6445,I love these tights theyre thick and durable and the pattern is super cute,1
6446,This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat but this wasnt an issue at all probably because of the intricate lace details the fabric is substantial enough that i dont feel like itll get a hole in it after multiple wears,1
6447,Love this sweater bought this with the matching leggings couldnt be more comfortable cozy fabric cute details loving them both please bring more of the same in different colors patterns,1
6448,I loved this skirt on the rack but it was not lined and super scratchy when worn i could barely wear it for the length it took to try it on so sad such a gorgeous skirt,0
6449,I love the ease of wearing and styling this top i am very pleased with the construction glad i ordered it,1
6450,The delicate print and coloring are stunning i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nicethis is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines,1
6451,I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse material is very comfortable and the fit is great,1
6452,These pants are awesome very light weight and will be great for springsummer now if only the sunshine will get here and melt away all of this snowi also purchased the top pictured on the model it is super cute with this outfit and can work with so many different looks check it outthey run big i would definitely consider sizing down or ordering two sizes to try on,1
6453,Just got this dress in the orange print and i cant begin to say how much i love it looks even better in person than online and its super flattering love the neckline armholes are perfect and show off toned arms and shoulders this is the kind of dress that makes time spent at the gym worthwhile the fabric is light and stretchy and the pockets are an extra bonusi would say fit is tts but keep in mind that its very loose at the bottom so i would go down in size if you want a less loo,1
6454,Love this white shirt it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist this goes with shorts skirts and jeans i will be wearing it all summer,1
6455,These are great pants i sized up from my typical size because i found the rise to be a little low for me i tend to like my pants a little higher on my waist the sa said these ran a little smaller for most when i got home i put them up to my size s and they were the same what woman likes to go up a size i purchased the blackgreat for work and play i would like the holly too but i am waiting,1
6456,This dress is absolutely gorgeous love love love i am and the petite sizing was perfect,1
6457,This is my second pair of pilcro chinos their pants and shorts are so softeven those who love to run around pantless might relent this brand tends to run a bit large so if you like your pants form fitting you may want to size down,1
6458,Love this dress really nice quality timeless design not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose the body size and length does run large so size down on this one now i understand why the petites were all sold out whatever modes,1
6459,The label says linen but its so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen its not a scratchy linen at all its a very very fine knit but the top is not sheer i do not think you need a cami under it i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown it has a slight drape but its not really baggy at all i bought the grey and it looks lighter online that it really is its a bit darker and has a silver essence also i liked this so much i just bought another one in mauve,1
6460,I bought this for my moms birthday and she loves it fits true to size and flattering for all busts mom went up a size to be able to put a sweater underneath but she received lots of compliments at a recent function she wore this to great lines,1
6461,I cant believe the reviews this dress has gotten i ordered it and was so excited to get it when i tried it on all of my excitement was gone while i love the color the quality just isnt there and its not worth the money even with the discount i used the fabric is not thick in fact it is quite sheer for velvet i honestly wouldnt feel comfortable with out a slip on underneath this second is the fit im a xs on top on bottom and i ordered an xs and the way this hung on me w,0
6462,This is one great button up shirt the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters with a came underneath or all on its own the fabric could be a bit thicker i am between a small and a medium a or an and bought this in a small,1
6463,Great top for day to night fine for work id think large breasted girls may find it too gaping for work as mentioned but b cup and below doesnt gape so very work appropriate,1
6464,I got this top in white and really like it its soft comfortable fits well but it is a little see through,1
6465,I have a couple of pair of hei hei pants from last summer that i love and was so happy to see these i am curvy size and got these in a and they fit perfectly in the hips and no gap at the waist i love them so much that i bought a second pair the only thing that could make them better is if they had a bit of stretch,1
6466,These pants are fabulous i want more colors and i got them on sale,1
6467,Soft comfortable material and flattering with or without a belt im typically wear a the small fits me perfectly and even the sleeve length is long enough when unrolled high hem hits me a few inches above the knee low hem a few inches below,1
6468,T la is such a great brand for t shirts this one is so soft and comfy and the yellow color is a great neutral yellow,1
6469,Love these vintage soft jeans they do run small so be sure get a size larger i am typically a and i ordered a look amazing with boots flip flops and slip ons love mother jeans work every time,1
6470,I ordered a size xl its flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shouldersnecksleeves matches the model i think its truetosize for the design it is so comfortable i love the softness of the material the problem for me is the color on my monitor it looks like a light ivory or white but the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesnt work for my complexion so ill be returning mine everything is wellmade though especially the vintagestyl,1
6471,I tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look it looks way better in person than in the pictures the picture really doesnt do it justice i consider myself a slight hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peepholekeyhole in the front you can hardly see on the model photo is visible im so happy with this dress i feel like i could wear it at workchu,1
6472,Love this dress the vibrant color and lace details are just beautiful can be dressed up or down the only concern i have is that the straps are thin and delicate but ill just have to be careful when hanging it up,1
6473,Stylish or comfy often the choice when looking for casual but not with this top its comfy and cozy and stylish to boot the sleeves are fun and create a nice line of interest you can pair this with jeans for a casual day or dress it up with slacks and heels and be comfy either way,1
6474,I purchased this in the blue motif i am pounds and got an xs i love everything about this tee it looks great with jeans and i love it with my white denim shorts i havent worn it off the shoulder yet i think it looks great as a regular tee i get compliments whenever i wear it so happy with this purchase,1
6475,This dress is so cute in the photo and fit true to size but the material is slinky and felt cheap the stitching was also poor quality i am so thankful that retailer will let us order a batch try on and return in storethis went back,0
6476,This top doesnt at all fit like it does on the model the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirtlike i typically wear size small or but perhaps an xs mightve fit or looked better sadly i must return this shirt,0
6477,The lace and fit were good but the length seemed awkward to me given how boxy and flowyish the dress is it felt like a baby doll with sleeves or something and i hated the outside middle material hated it it felt cheap and odd when compared to the lace maybe i was just not in the right demographic for this piece,0
6478,I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly love the length it hits mid hip it is more of an aline than straight as show in the picture the detail is fun and the sweater is well made highly recommend it i have received lots of compliments on this sweater,1
6479,Very pretty shimmery suitable for slightly dressier occasions comfortable fit,1
6480,I love this dress even more beautiful in person,1
6481,Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short im it also is too big the empire waist has no shape or flatter the sleeves are huge the neckline was falling off my shoulder i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong the print is very fun and my guess is thats what is attracting everyone to it it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me back it goes,0
6482,Yay for the return of shirts that show your form but dont reveal the flaws i bought this in cream which only seems to be in stores right now the stripes on the cream version are vibrant and beautiful the weight of the top is very nice and really hugs your shape i did think it ran a tad small i bought the large but also could have worn the medium,1
6483,I was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews well i must say im so glad i did i really love the shape of this dress im heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist the dress is very well made if you order the right size for you the slip dress will stay in place im going to style it with high black platform heels but i also like it with boots as,1
6484,My favorite colors are purple and green so when i was in the store and saw the beautiful purple flowers on the top of this blouse and all up and down the sleeves i was was blown away i was disappointed by the bottom of it just huge flowy green fabric with no design on it whatsoever i went with my first impression and bought it but now that im trying it on in the house im still bothered by the throwaway bottom of this blouse im thinking this is just another retailer maternity t,0
6485,I like the make of this dress the fabric is thick and light at the same timethe cut is loose and flattering the different patterns are also very fun colors are gorgeous nice details the buttons are sturdy i tried on both p and p not much difference in the i would go petite if you are on the short side the p was just a bit snugger near the chest but didnt gape the waist is definitely meant to be looser so dont expect a fitted dress length was slightly above the knee,1
6486,The blouse is beautiful the quality and design are spot on but it runs quite large i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model its huge im going to have to reorder in a smaller size but im not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better ill probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person for comparison i am pounds,1
6487,The material of the lace is nice and soft it is not a stiff lace i am dd lbs and ordered the small it fits perfect not tight through bust or the arm holes i wore today for the first time and everyone that sees the top loves it as much as i do i ordered the white and in the pictures it looks like a bright white it is not it is more of an antique white and i am wearing a nude colored camisole and it works perfect i think it will be really cute with a colored cami also this will,1
6488,This is a great light free flowing top for the summer i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area but if you are small busted you wont be affected it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer,1
6489,I usually wear either an xs or a small and i went with the small because i wanted it flowy and long because i am it is a great fit but it is a little sheer i will probably have to wear a cami underneath,1
6490,I ordered this in a small and medium hoping one would work but the previous reviews were exactly correct the bodice is way too small in proportion to the rest of the jumpsuit the bottom has lots of fabric which wouldnt be bad except you have to go up a size to make the bodice fit then the bottom becomes overwhelming i am and so i have a slim build and couldnt get the bodice to zip in a small the medium would have needed altering which wouldnt have fixed the extra fabric on th,0
6491,This jacket is beautiful the embroidery is very well done the jacket is fully lined in black i usually wear a lxl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small,1
6492,I am in love with theses they are incredibly comfortable and flattering i have an hourglass figure and they hug my hips perfectly they perfect for the gym but also look great with a tunic and booties for fun weekend wear good pure are my new go to legging brand im going to order the solid black and other patterns retailer has,1
6493,I bought this sweater in the navy blue and love it its soft and not itchy and the tie back detailing gives it that extra something special im and d waist line inches and the size m is a perfect fit wore it yesterday to my sons rd birthday party with jeans and received a lot of compliments,1
6494,I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes no problem well the reviews are correct i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink i am returning them this evening i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank it is made ve,0
6495,These pants are so great very comfortable true to size and i can see myself wearing these all spring and summer im lbs and my usual petite fit great these would also make excellent travel pants i purchased the green color and will be purchasing the tan color once i get done writing this review,1
6496,I purchased the green in xs and it fits perfect its very flattering also i purchased the blue in xxsp only size available but it was too short,1
6497,For me this is the perfect blouse alone or with a cardigan its a winner not too low cut armholes are perfect i would buy other colors if they were available,1
6498,Love this dress ordered a p and it fit perfectly,1
6499,This shirt was better than expected the fit is fitted but still flows its comfortable and the material is great it goes with anything ive tucked it into pants and skirts but ive also just worn with leggings looks great either way im going to buy more of this shirt,1
6500,Love this skirt i thought it would be much shorter but when i tried it on it was the perfect length and super cute the material is thick but not uncomfortable and very move able,1
6501,This is my third dress by this designer i love his work this will be the most versatile and classic of the threei love how wearing his dresses makes me feel my best and comfortable unique and well made,1
6502,Absolutely love these leggings warm comfortable great way to relax after a long day snuggle up in thesedo stretch even longer after a while but wash and wear again is easy even wear out of the housebought in green and love how well they go with sweaters shirts etc,1
6503,I love this great quality and super cozy perfect to throw on for casual summer nights,1
6504,I wore this for the first time today and got so many compliments im a personal stylist and went to an event for the company i work forwhich means i was in a room filled with stylish people and i got nothing but compliments about my top it is so comfy and i did worry at first about the beading and if it was too fragile but it was fine i sized down for this top but cant wait to wear it all fall and winter,1
6505,When this piece arrived i was surprised at how weightless it was there are layers to it an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all to take it home i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out super stubborn but i am pleased with the look of the garment usually i like the look of a dress that,1
6506,I wasnt expecting much out of this when i was in the store but liked the colors and thought id try it out grabbed a s and xs im usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes the s fit perfectly tts and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit it does have a detachable slipliner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on mefalling low,1
6507,I should have heeded the previous reviewers advice but im really short so i thought id give it a try there is something really wrong with the bust first its about inches higher than it should be the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups they are really only designed to fit cones not curves from the side it looked hideous too bad because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous,0
6508,I have an athletic body i have no curves and this dress made me look so feminine and long and lean on top of it being beautiful the dress has a very comfortable jersey knit type lining so easy to wear and incredibly comfortable sitting and or dancing,1
6509,Unlike other reviews i did not have a problem with the seam this is a cute shirt that can be dressed up or down,1
6510,Ah i wanted to love this but without anything under it as pictured the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob i am and a small b cup i ordered an xs petite it fits but there isnt enough material under the armpits the fabric and design is great other than this flaw sadly returning,0
6511,All the colors are beautiful the white is a true white i got the gray one it runs large so i would recommend sizing down unless you plan on layering using thicker fabrics underneath,1
6512,Bought this in my usual size small and it fits well i wear it around the house constantly to stay warm this winter it is so very warm and comfortable very easy to wear could be worn out but i prefer it with lounge pants due to the comfort and warmth it provides it is a nice neutral and can be worn with many other retailer casual clothes highly recommend,1
6513,This dress is so much better in person i got the petite size i am and it seems to run a bit smaller than the regular size i have a fairly large bust so i went up a size and it seems to fit perfectly love the colors and vintage design i cant wait to wear it for a wedding i will be attending,1
6514,Very pleased with this top i got the blue and white first and now im getting the red and white the material is comfy and not sheer and the slits at the side and the zipper in back add extra style,1
6515,This sweater is super soft and comfortable runs very big i usually wear a large i purchased a medium and it is almost too big,1
6516,True to size if we take into account how some brands are making things bigger for hte size i ordered both the xxs and xs and xxs was more flattering years past xxs would be way too snug my size didnt change pros i actually thought the cut was flattering on me the top is very cute hte bummer for me is the fabric the grey part is not as sift as i would have hoped and the shirt part can wrinkle did in the package length was nice for both sizes so overall i would go smaller for a,1
6517,Fun flirty feminine love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants just love highly recommend easy to wear,1
6518,I love this dress as far as the fit goes it makes my curvy figure loook even better with how its cut that being said the different patterns over each boob made the dress look crazy it makes you look quite lopsided in the chest wasnt just me but my store people also agreed had the pattern on the chest been the same it would be great but even though my boobs are of mostly equal size they looked too crazy its quite noticeable on so sad,0
6519,I am so glad i returned this dress for a size down i am and lbs curvy and muscular build and the medium was surprisingly much too large on me i returned it for a small and oh my it is perfect i plan on wearing this to two summer weddings this year and will then wear it for work it really is a goanywheredoanything sort of dress,1
6520,Dress is pretty i was disappointed by the slip which is too small like previous customer i am an inch taller than the model and i feel more comfortable it being a tunic with leggings nice but not nice enough to keep i am returning,0
6521,I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and im glad i did its now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning ive worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt so soft and flattering i got it in the red but am tempted by the blue,1
6522,Nice design but very wrinkly fabric that doesnt fall well also as has happened to me before retailer sent me a dress clearly wornused and returned by someone else with hair all over it you would think they would at least look at returned dresses to make sure that the returned clothes were free of stains and hair before they send them out,0
6523,As a lazy one i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision yes i owe a big thank you to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here and thank you now it is my time to pay back to the community this pair of jeans are just perfect perfect design perfect fit and perfect material soft cozy and hip with a good spirit i dont want to take it off once i put on i am pounds and ordered size,1
6524,This gem is beyond lovely i saw this years ago and regretted not buying it years ago and then i was looking on here as i do on a weekly basis and bam it was there i gasped hahahaha but really this is an amazing statement piece i am usually a l but got the m as it is a bit big and its your preference on how you want to wear it i will be wearing this to death for autumn winter and forever its just one of those soft and not itchy and i have sensitive skin,1
6525,I love this shirt it is so soft not boxy at all very flattering my only complaint is that there arent more colors,1
6526,Almost the perfect skirt great colorssuper cute fitvery flatteringgreat lengthvery versatile only issue was size normally a solid i ended up a full sizes smaller very stretchy and comfortablejust try it on first or order a couple of sizes go down at least size as others have saidpilcro strikes againits such a great brand with the most flattering shapes and fabrics,1
6527,I dont normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse it was huge i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase it would be that size the red against the blue was very pretty but i didnt know if felt like a little kid in a uniform the back did not lie flat not sure if it was because of my d chest or because of the shirt design it is well made and i th,1
6528,This dress is exactly what i hoped it would be super sexy and great material,1
6529,I love this dress design fabric colorscurrently wear it as maternity and its super cute but it is my size and cant wait to wear it next springsummer as a regular dress when i can show off a more slender waist get compliments all the time dress up w a pair of heels for a date night or dress down w flip flops the fabric on the bottom wrinkles easily when gilded so not ideal for travel but thats a minor thing,1
6530,Was in my local retailer today and just had to try this on it appeared to be a structured jacket but it is actually a sweaterjacket gives a very chanel vibe and looks so chic i plan on wearing it with just about everything i would probably wear it open most times but i love the closure with the button detail i am large busted but petite lbs and this was way more flattering on me than most jackets normally the sleeves are too long but these were just right i am sure i wi,1
6531,This is such a flattering top i bought it in green the green is a cooler version of kelly green not the muted green i see on my computer screen im fair complected and that color looks great on me i love the elastic at the waistband which helps camouflage my mom belly i wish they made more tops with blousy elastic waists i bought several new tops this summer and this is probably my favorite after wearing it for a couple of weeks i decided to remove the tie string which hangs low it,1
6532,I love this item ill wear it as a cover up or to dress up and go out the material is great for summer light and breathes i first ordered a small because the medium was sold out it fit too highwater i then ordered the large and it fits great the medium may have been fine too im,1
6533,This blouse drapes nicely the in the store was too big which is not what i usually find with maeve i wear a or small in most blouses i ordered the and it was still too big so i hope the will work,1
6534,I think this romper is super stylish kind of dvfish and its aspictured except its more colorful in person the vines are pink and pale aqua and the flowers are deeper yellows with white beige parts and pink dots in them i see what other reviewers mean that the fabric is thin it is but i wouldnt say sheer its a lightweight woven fabric the problem is theres no stretch so when you reach up the whole romper hikes up i think its truetosize i got my usual xspetite and it fits g,1
6535,Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only my white washcloth turned bright yellow the food came out but surrounding area was super faded so i returned them took the second pair home wore them a few times they stretched out so much washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light these pants are way too much trouble,0
6536,I have been dying to try a mara hoffman bathing suit so i went for this one unfortunately the design of the bathing suit is not like what they sent me the middle where the tops meets the bottom is squared off not like that v that it looks like in this photo it also makes for major side boobsagging on each side i was very disappointed,0
6537,Very cute very comfortable for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand this dress fits the bill,1
6538,Always looking for sweaters that are wearable in south florida stumbled upon this gem from the front gorgeous silvery gray soft sweater and stunning open back with romantic silky black bow details bows will hide bra easily underneath so comfortable classy and sexy,1
6539,The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like ive sometimes found the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric sort of like a double knit but with its own simple striped pattern the collar looks like it might be itchy but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly,1
6540,Love love love this sweater lots of compliments as well,1
6541,This is so beautiful i loved it online but its even prettier in person its a little greener than it appears in the photo the straps are actually a green rather than white im lbs and the xs fits perfectly worth the money,1
6542,Love this jacket you will definitely want to size down though i am usually a mediumlarge but i was swimming in that size i opted for the xss and it is perfect,1
6543,Im in love with this dress i have seen the chevron pattern of this dress on many women and i can honestly say that i havent seen a body that it doesnt look good on i am a busty girl and was afraid the shape of this dress would make me look as if i was expecting and much to my surprise it didnt at all this is such a great transitional piece to have in your closet i highly recommend it,1
6544,I bought this top in the purple color but i believe it to be more of a cobalt it is a beautiful color i wore it to dinner the same night i purchased it my husband said he loved the color and style i wear either a s or m in retailer tops depending on the brand with this one i chose a small and its fits perfectly i have a petite frame lbs but with a f bust it is very flattering as with most off the shoulder tops they say your shoulders never age the length is just right,1
6545,This is a fantastic dress i wore it for a recent wedding and received many compliments the fit is phenomenal the dress is extremely comfortable and flattering i am fullfigured and it fit beautifully and was very true to size this dress would look good on an year old or a year old,1
6546,I was so excited to order this top it looked like it was made of more sturdy soft cotton but sadly after receiving it today i found that to not be true its incredibly sheer youd have to wear a cami underneath which defeated the point for me the pleating in the front hides your bra but you can see it from all other angles i tried it on with an unlined nude lace bra which can easily hide under sheer clothing i was hoping to be able to wear it on its own without a cami and for it to,0
6547,Love this top fits me perfect i am bigger on top and received many compliments in this shirt,1
6548,Well made dress cute pleats though a few didnt lie perfectly flat it was a little too long for me im especially in the torsostraps area also the armholes were a little large fits tts,1
6549,The fabric is very nice and it is completely lined except for the sleeves which are sheer i expected the dress to be lighter so wearing this on a hot day wont work i ordered an xs because of the former reviews it said it ran large and it does its roomy straight and quite flowy i wanted a casual non clinging dress and its just like the picture it hits below the knee,1
6550,Great tee flows well and very soft true to size,1
6551,Like another reviewer said the pictures do not do this fabric justice its lightly textured but still soft i love the fit of thisjust the right amount of oversizedflowy,1
6552,The quality is good as is the design idea but practically it doesnt work ordered an xs and the top still ballooned out stiffly this top is not soft or flowy it is stiff and very wide,0
6553,Beautiful dress wanted something different even bought the hat very flattering,1
6554,This dress is beautiful it is even prettier in person than in pictures i was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail i am lbs and went with a p and it fit perfectly i typically do not like things to be extremely clingy this could easily be dressed up or down personally i wore it to a wedding and received many compliments on its uniqueness,1
6555,Love these pants they are so soft and comfortable do not fall down like low rise trousers i like the length for wearing with flats most wide bottom pants are too long and these are very casual to be worn with flats,1
6556,This top is simple but super cute and comfortable the bow in the back adds a feminine touch and it fits well no gaping arm holes and not too tight or too loose the white color is slightly seethrough but not enough to wear a cami with my neutral racerback bra the xs fit me perfectly for reference im small busted and lbs,1
6557,Fantastic top fits flatters and falls beautifully i loved the white so much i went back for the black i wear with jeans leggings and with pant suits lovely with all,1
6558,I just received this in the mail and must say its one of my favorite purchases in a long time from retailer the navy polka dot color combo is classic yet fun with the orange looks great on its own as well as under a cardy this will be in heavy rotation,1
6559,I got this in blue and i love it it skims your curves without being clingy and it is very comfortable i was hesitant to buy this but its surprisingly flattering it will be perfect with heels for early fall then worn with a long sleeve shirt and boots when the temperatures dip my only caution is that it is shorter than it appears in this photo it falls well above my knees and i am shorter than the model regardless i am thrilled with my purchase,1
6560,Received this product with a gaping hole in it very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse,0
6561,Gosh this is a beauty maeve can be a little iffy on sizing but i find this to fit tts beautiful details fit is comfortable yet elegant nice lengthi have zero complaints on this it is sheer enough to need something underneath but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesnt seem bothersome nice quality piece not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric,1
6562,Hi this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion very feminine it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric love it,1
6563,This trench coat solves my eternal problem with trench coats which is that when i see one on a model in an ad they look effortless and casual but then when i try one on it looks rigid and stuffy somehow this trench coat drapes beautifully that said its not the same kind of fabric as a traditional trench coat so it probably isnt water resistant im fine with that it looks amazing,1
6564,I agree with the previous reviewer that the length is not at all what is shown in the picture much shorter than that and while the overall detail of the skirt is very nice the elastic waistband makes it look cheap considering the price,0
6565,This dress definitely runs large so i ordered it through my local store in order to get a size that would fit i ordered one size down but could have gone down i love the embroidered design i just wore the dress to a slovak festival yesterday and it fit right in very comfortable and fun to wear,1
6566,This dress is absolutely fantastic beautiful highquality and fits like a glove even better than i could have imagined,1
6567,This shirt is perfect for me i have very small shoulders but i am pear shaped so the flare on the bottom is welcomed for my body type i bought colors i have a similar shirt from retailer a few years ago that was multicolor which i wear all the time so i am thankful they have repeated this design also i did get this on sale which is a more realistic price for the quality of this shirt,1
6568,Im lbs with a f chest this dress looked like a cross between little house on the prairie and a mu mu i cant imagine this looking good on anyone who isnt tall also the straight across rather high neck line wasnt flattering to a large chest and then the arm holes are huge the fabric was a bit shiny and felt cheap it wasnt see through but it had the feel of a nightgown not a hundred dollar dress,0
6569,Originally ordered a large but it was huge the medium fit perfectly im lbs lovely material and interesting side details the sides do come up quite high but a camo or tank underneath does the trick lots of compliments,1
6570,I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long im only so it goes to above my ankles its like a midi dress on me but i really love it it is so flattering there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you dont want to show its the usual bailey great quality so slimming hugs the booty in the right way definitely worth the money,1
6571,I just received this dress in petite extra small for reference i am and pounds to answer the previous reviewers question the regular size of this dress runs long if you want it to look like the one in the video then order it in petite i personally love the style and the material however the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it,1
6572,Love love this i was hesitant to buy this at first the reviews made it seem so big and i wasnt sure if it was my kind of outfit but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find the xs was a typical retailer size for me so the size was good in this too the color is fabulous and the fit is great the rise is slightly short but not a problem i cant wait to where it for my next great event i wish i could buy it in the black too,1
6573,This top is so cute on would look great on anyone as the style quality and color is incredible highly recommend even at this price you wont regret it,1
6574,Absolutely stunning top love what a great buy on sale i wear a mediumlarge and purchased the size fits perfect beware that the bottom has somewhat of a flair the material is light so i would say this top is something to be worn transitioning between seasons late summer to fall,1
6575,Im lbs and the petite small fits perfectly i love the length of the shorts not too short and not frumpy either the waist has a hidden band so it hugs you in a good way and makes the top half slightly blousy so its forgiving will go great with gray booties black wedges or sandals,1
6576,I love this dress like another reviewer said its the perfect teacher dress i wore it on the first day of school its comfortable and flattering and super cute i received lots of compliments,1
6577,Love the quality and fit it runs small so i got one size bigger,1
6578,I am and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length i got a size which is my typical size the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute its worth it great dress for transitioning in,1
6579,I absolutely love slips and i like the grey tone of this oneand that it is not super shiny it adds to the versatility of the slipwhich i wear many ways i wear them as under layers for long cardigans i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses and i also have been known to wear them to bed the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider an a different color which adds just enough,1
6580,As soon as i saw this dress i knew i had to have it i just tried it on and it is beautiful i feel gorgeous and glamorous i cant wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attentionthe silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the looki am and i purchased the small petite its slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs puckers out so im going to,1
6581,Love this skirt very comfy looks like its very expensive material but feels comfortable,1
6582,Great fit wonderfully made and priced just right,1
6583,Love everything about this the color is gorgeous great fall addition to any wardrobe the tassels are cool usually dont like things like thati wear a small or medium in retailer usually small and i purchased the small,1
6584,I got the purple color and absolutely love it i am but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely,1
6585,I am tall and usually wear medium in retailer tops i love this top purchased same style in sleeveless this past summer and was hoping the style would return as i was complimented every single time i wore my summer version i do wear a cami underneath i agree that in the picture the yoke doesnt seem pink however i like it even better with the more pink hue as it gives an even more eye catching piece the pizzaz i look forward to seeing in retailer offers i love retailerpo,1
6586,Fun pattern which goes with just about anything cool for summer very comfortable fitted style but true to size,1
6587,This blouse is sumptuous the fabric is soooo soft embroidery beautiful fit flattering sadly i returned it due to the color i mostly shop online due to time restriction and the picture looks to be a winter white to me it is a light yellow color most pleasing with the cobalt embroidery alas any shade of yellow makes my skin look jaundice so back it had to go,1
6588,I love this sweater it is wellmade the colors are great adn the feel is very soft i just love troubadour never knew of it before this seasonbut already own a few pircesi tried on the blue version fits true to size i dont hink i need the petite the nexl ine was more falttering than the pcture shows i love hte sleeves too i think overall the shirt is a bit of flared out style which i love,1
6589,This shirt is so cute i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be as im not one for frills but the sleeves sit nicely also i am between a size small and medium i got the small and it definitely is flowy runs big so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down i got the red and its a perfect autumn winter color the cut outs are not too showy so its not revealing for us gals who are a little more bellyconscious its the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a,1
6590,I bought this tunic for my mom as a birthday gift it is very good quality and will look cute for fall too,1
6591,Love this shirt tried it on in of the colors and both were very flattering the quality of the shirt is great worth the price for sure,1
6592,I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it its soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together i initially sized up to a based on other reviews but exchanged it for an my normal size its flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric in the its just right for the style,1
6593,I so wanted to love this suit it was gorgeous the color the quality the style but i am returning and can not recommend it the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun but i didnt feel like i could even walk safely and i am not wellendowed very bummed but its going back,0
6594,This dress is fun and flattering love the pieced denim look and the aline style unlike other reviewers i found this dress to be true to size for my pearshaped figure the length is long enough to wear anywhere and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures,1
6595,I absolutely love this top i bought the ivory color and i am definitely considering buying the black as well it feels true to size but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy i cant wait to wear this top all season long,1
6596,I feel in love when i tried it on im an usually have to hem long dresses but this on fits perfectly its full length on me its shorter on the model but i think it looks better full length and its a gorgeous burgundy soft and comfortable cant wait to wear it,1
6597,Absolutely love the design fabric and fit of this dress a perfect dress for many occasions one of the many reasons i love this company excellent customer service employees and of course adorable clothing would recommend buying this dress and to all the taller girls i am and lbs and this dress is still a good length no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear,1
6598,The dress is a great buy especially since it was on sale it fits like his other dresses flattering as i dont have a big bust and have a bit of extra skin from pregnancies but with this dress i feel amazing get a ton of compliments when i wear it,1
6599,I have many maeve shirts and this one does not disappoint i purchased the blue and love it i do agree with other reviews though that the chest is a little tight while the rest of the fit is small,1
6600,I really love this top normally i would not go for a lot of narrow stripes like this because i would think it is too busy but this one is certainly the exception both colors are fantastic and i think the design is alluringnot busy i like that it buttons down which offers a lot of flexibility to display necklaces or have completely up to complete change the look one of the things i absolutely love about this is that it has long sleeves i think it is rare these days to find something that i,1
6601,I purchased this in the ivory color in store and liked it so much i ordered the plum color online i am almost always an xl but this fit better in the l size its very soft and comfy and i love the swingy style will be wearing it a lot,1
6602,I love these pants they are very flattering and comfy and look like real leather they are also machine washable which is great ive worn mine times already,1
6603,Gals if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale dont worry it will between the poor fit and the polyester i have no good things to report about it this is very much below retailers usual quality and style,0
6604,Like most of the other reviewers i agree this skirt runs quite small i had to size up sizes the waist is quite small but there are parts that are elasticized nicely hidden and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie i think it will work nicely year round too,1
6605,This simple dress will turn heads it fits to the body hugging just in the right spots i love this dress it is soft and feels amazing on you can adjust the tie in the front i purchased the copper color but i have to say that is much more brown to me than copper a dark brown i still think the dress is adorable looks cute with booties or knee high boots winner,1
6606,Love the color fit and feel of these jeans the thin material is stretchy and comfortable i didnt have to pull them up every so often during a hour party they didnt bag out after the first wearing and are true to size i got a p the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle the rise wasnt too low for me highly recommend,1
6607,The colors on this top are very bright cheery i love wearing this top i get a lot of complements on the combination of the pastel colors it reminds me of a warm summer day i wear a pink tank under neath and it really brings out the pink colors of the top,1
6608,The only strange thing is the size i used to wear size s bl but this time the small is way too big i still keep it and put a belt on it is a very very pretty dress i used to buy sale from antheropologie but can not wait this time i am very impressed by the design can not praise more,1
6609,I got this shirt in an xxsp and it has a great slim body the front ruffle isnt overpowering although i dont love the ruffles on the sleeves i think its just a little too much but they arent visible under a sweater or jacket the length is just right so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy the silk is just a touch sheer but not too seethrough its a good shirt,1
6610,Being somewhat on the fluffy side the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer i am between a size and a and the fits perfectly light and airy a very nice simple embroidery in contrasting color very chic in an effortless way the armholes are just rightnot too big the color is definitely a creamy ivory worth the cost because i dont think it will be available for too long,1
6611,I ordered the xxs i think retailer has gone on the bigger size again and i went from small to xs to xxs so true to size in that sense i love the color nude and it is pretty soft and comfortable the cut is flattering the cowl neck is pretty the sleeves are shorter and the hem is wider aka swing this would look totally adorable with my flare or wide leg jeans i think ti would look nice too with skinnies if you have leaner legsfor reference dd in waist lbs,1
6612,Bought this in the silvery grey color in the store yesterday and i have to say the photos dont do this top justice it hangs beautifully is nicely lined and is well made i will leave the ties hanging rather than tied it isnt too long but long enough and has a nice swing im short waisted and large breasted and this top is super flattering on me,1
6613,I am returning the dress it has too much volume and is not flattering at all,0
6614,Im super happy with this dress its extremely well made very light and comfortable and the shoulder cutouts are tastefully done this dress is cotton but doesnt look cheap or too casual its one of those rare finds that will look great dressed up or down this will absolutely work across seasons with leggings and bootsbooties or bare legs and sandals when spring comes around i do feel like it runs a little large but again its cotton so i know there will be some shrinking when wash,1
6615,I love how comfortable this dress is it does run a little large so i would order a size down im and around lbs and had to exchange the xsp for an xxsp,1
6616,Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece i live in texas so our temps stay high until october this top in the purple motif color is perfect since the colors arent look too summery but the fabric is lightweight this top is a little bit boxy but drapes nicely so it wont make you look wide as with most holding horses tops this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length,1
6617,I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim thinking it be a great throwback to the s it is actually very flattering on with the lines running down vertical giving a slimming look to any figure it is also very soft and comfortable on and has nice large pockets on the sides it doesnt look dated at all once on and im sure will get plenty of use as the weather warms up for reference im tall and weigh close to lbs and found the small fit well the only drawback was the pice but i,1
6618,This dress is timeless so cute on and fits easily i like that it has long sleeves yet it is a light fabric comfortable and stylish that is for me i am taking it this weekend to nyc for a trip i think i will fit right in,1
6619,These are a beautiful color but run large i ordered my usual size and they are falling off of me they are very low rise so i dont think ill be trying the smaller size cant even imagine them being lower also they are cropped thats hard to tell in the picture,0
6620,I loved this shirt flattering and pretty its hand wash only or dry clean i hand washed it and the blue tshirt part of the shirt shrank and now the front of the shirt is too short for me would not recommend due to shrinkage too bad,0
6621,Im lbs b cup slender throughout size fit perfectly lightweight flattering dress bought on sale to wear next year to babybridal shower type event,1
6622,I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package the size was perfect for me usual medium size shortwaisted f this blouse is truly a find luxurious linen in a unique appealing design excellent fit the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right the vneck is not too deep thankfully bra friendly the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme and finally admirable craftsmanship i highly recommend this will feel di,1
6623,Love these pants im and the length is perfect could even wear a little heel the fold over waist is so comfy they feel like pajamas but look very classy i bought the navy and silver more of a khaki color on sale for a great deal the washing instructions say line dry but i threw them in the dryer on low and they came out fine just need to remove and hang quickly for less wrinkles,1
6624,Absolutely adore this dress details fabric and deep pockets here is the caveat at least for me i am a typical size and ordered the dress in a size for a little looser casual fit the is so small i can barely place over my shoulders and cannot button i have reordered a size and perhaps the dress i received is not tagged properly so disappointed as the item is on backorder,1
6625,Shirtdresses are a warm weather favorite for me and this one will surely make its way into my regular rotation the outer cotton eyelet is intricate and beautiful the color cornflower blue is endlessly flattering for many complexions the cut is classic with the twist of the handkerchief hemline and the length is work appropriate per a previous reviewer i sized up to ensure a fit across the bust and am glad i did overall the fit is not totally perfect on me but its still great and gar,1
6626,I love the unique design and the fit they are very flattering they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great,1
6627,Per other reviewers i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers it is short cropped but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses,1
6628,These are a comfortable flattering casual pant i usually wear a in skinny jeans so i dropped down to a to make sure they werent to baggy i love them and will wear the a lot,1
6629,This will be a season dress for me its well made comfy and flattering the suede skirt is risky i know but ill be sure to put the napkin in my lap,1
6630,All tlas are great but this one style is my fave very comfortable chic and washes well i got the grey but im back to get more colors,1
6631,I found this dress delightful i have worn it numerous times and though quite long for some girls fits me well my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast the fabric is light and comfortable i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing i am lbs and a a cup i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well,1
6632,Like another reviewer i initially passed by this sweater and thought nothing of it until i noticed it on display super cute and ultra comfy the kind of sweater that just beckons to be warn in the fall i purchased this in the olive color and just love it very cute and flattering for a ponchotype sweater i do think it runs a bit large so i sized down for the perfect fit i highly recommend this item,1
6633,This top is very cute and is made out of soft material that isnt clingy at all and you dont have to be stick thin for it to look good i dont like to show my arms normally but this top is very flattering all around i love it,1
6634,This top also caught my eye in my local store and being a devoted deletta lover i had to buy it is a straight slim fit so i bought a medium instead of my usual small to glide over my curvy lower half its thin finely woven knit with two cute little buttons at the top of the side slit the cut and longer length in the back is very flattering i bought the heathered black and have worn with my black pilcro leggings its a great top to wear over leggings or skinny jeans no belts with th,1
6635,I absolutely love this sweaterit is perfect for fall,1
6636,I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheersee through i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans,1
6637,I adore maeve tops and this is no exception im small on top a ordered my usual maeve size im lbs ordered regular not petite because the front of this blouse is already short fits appropriarely but take note it is much more blousy than it appears in the photo you have to try it on either youll love it or hate it i do love its slightly oversized blousy fit so i was not hesitant to put it in the dryer on low for about minutes well it shrunk up like nothing,1
6638,Lush eye catching print saw it tried it on and had to have it full price or not very comfortable bought one size down and it fit perfectly,1
6639,Slighty fitted flattering very soft and not itchy the orange is a very nice color,1
6640,The buttons on the back are very tedious you will need someone to help you if you get past that hurdle then you have the look of a little girl in a smock way too big like a nightgown nice quality but not practical,0
6641,This will be my favorite fall acquisition looks better in person very flattering does run large love the combo of tan and grey,1
6642,This top is very cute got it in the lighter color the fit is great and it will go with many things if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also,1
6643,Love this dress and so does my boyfriend took my usual size and its a little snug but the would have been too big,1
6644,I normally dont care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits i got my usual medium and it fits well it has a nice drape and is not see through,1
6645,I wore this dress to an outdoor farm wedding and it was perfect it runs small im lbs with c bust and i got a size i tried on blue and pink both were great but the blue won me over it wrinkles easily so i had to use an iron on low to medium beforehand will wear many more times,1
6646,Super cute cardigan can wear it with black tights and boots or shorts when it starts warming up the color is great i was hesitant about buying it but thankful i did will probably buy it in the black too,1
6647,Similar to others here these pants were ruined after one wash the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash which was okay but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside id rather not call attention to that particular area of my body couldve been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality,0
6648,This dress is crazy flattering and extremely versatile i wish it came in other colorsi would scoop them all up great price plus used by birthday off coupon the fabric is light weightbut not flimsy plus its lined with a satin fabric so the dress wont stick to you im and i ordered the petite xsmall and it is perfect i can see it with fun sneakers like the picture or with some fun jewelry and high wedges for going out thinking of buying a nd one as back upits th,1

6650,I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one,1
6651,This appealed to me online it came in petite during the promo in july i decided i shld order the petite small while they lasted although way too hot to even consider wearing until fall glad i did i am short the regular length wld be a bit too long great color quality not too thick or weighty like that its a cotton blend will go well with the many skinny jeanscordsleggings i have love the blue now i have to wait a few months to wear it usually wear a size small in,1
6652,I love how this long sweater drapes its soft feels great on and looks fabulous over leggings or skinnys,1
6653,Saw this on line and bought right away perfect romper for summer color is great and fabric is soft like all cloth and stone chambray it fits pretty true to size maybe a little small when putting on but i think it will stretch out a little i didnt want it baggy fits great through hips and booty looks good i will wear with flip flops sandals or wedge i also got off which made deal even better,1
6654,Love love love i got this jumper right before it started getting hot and it has been my go to all summer fun night out with the girls perfect walking around the mall awesome at work with a green vest super every time i wear this i get tons of compliments did i mention it feels like youre wearing pajamas which in my book is everything get it,1
6655,I purchased the blue s lbs b and this was very large and boxy on me not altogether unflattering but not so flattering that it justifies the price the blue color is very pretty in persondarker and slightly marled however although this sweater is certainly cashmere and very soft because of it it is very thinto the point that i consider this a top rather than a sweater the silk panel in back is pretty but again thin and unlined i think that even on sale this is ov,0
6656,Love this skirt i purchased the chino skirt during the summer and wore it weekly this skirt is the fall equivalent flattering and true to size there is some stretch to it so its very comfortable highly recommend,1
6657,Love the idea of this top but it is so thin and the sequins look so cheap the quality reminds me of something you would buy for at a market abroad definitely disappointed with the quality for the price will be retuning,0
6658,The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink which is fine just a tad unexpected i ordered a size and it fits perfectly ddd chest the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine unique touch to an otherwise basic top i cant wait to wear it,1
6659,This jacket is stylish and unique love the lines and the fit is very flatteringcoral is a bit more orangedk peach than what i think of as typical coral fun color for spring i sized up from my typical s to m,1
6660,I love these cozy fashionable leggings they are super flattering and thick enough to wear to yoga or out and about in the real world i will definitely be getting another pair they seem true to size i am tall and usually wear a lg,1
6661,I love to layer and this is a great layering piece it is wonderful for cool crisp mornings this cardigan looks great with skinny jeans and a cute tee the model in the photo shows a super way to look great for a casual day so soft and comfortable i did not want to take it off on the cloudy day it was worn very happy with this purchase and delighted i was able to get it on sale,1
6662,I am so glad i tried this dress on it is so chic and beautiful perfect for an evening out or during the day i cant believe the price,1
6663,The fit on this dress is super flattering i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one i am definitely a pear shape bigger on the bottom than the top one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top this is not often the case i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it i also love the colors i bought the green and blue i have worn it once,1
6664,This white shirt is very thin esp in the front and see through i would have to wear a cami underneath unless i wanted people to see the outline of my bra it seems very flimsy and poor quality even at the sale price disappointed and will return,0
6665,I recently purchased this blouse in black i love the soft yet crepe like fabric and the small bit of negative space trim just above the bust line gives it an air of elegance comfortable and breathable i see this becoming a how did i live without this staple,1
6666,I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans this is exactly what i was looking for the color is better than the pic to me the style is flattering the size is just right cant wait to wear it i strongly recommend it,1
6667,This is a great casual skirt i ordered the p or xs petite and it fit perfectly both colors are nice i dont think i could choose though i do have a taupe skirt so leaning towards the slate color the fit is also flattering waist is snug but not tight the fabric is soft could wear in the fall or even winter with tights i recommend lbs in waist,1
6668,I wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming i got a petite and it fit perfectly for reference i am and lbs you ill not regret buying this dress,1
6669,I never would have thought to choose this but an retailer associate suggested the black sweater as a topper while i was trying on the camellia dropwaist dress and it made a sale i bought them both the sweater while not decked with beads or embroidery adds an incredible definition to any outfit that is overly flowy i would say the photo above showing the grey sweater says it all usually a size in retailer dresses the small fit well i appreciate the cotton fiber content as well as the ver,1
6670,I loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store and brought home a size med its a nice weight of material lined and very classy i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suitjackets for business meetings but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet i realized how much it looked like a labcoat i am not giving up if it goes on sale ill order a small to see if it is more flattering but at this point its a nogo,1
6671,These jeans are my favorite skinny jeans they are expensive but so worth it i had nordstrom reinforce holes with patches so they still look distressed but wont rip further i wear these at least once a week,1
6672,I am rarely disappointed by maeve and this was no exception i am a b and broad shouldered and my normal size fit like a dream the white print is opaque so no bra seethrough such a cute fun print the fabric has a really soft hand too,1
6673,I often have a hard time finding items that fit true to size but this top fits perfectly it is cut really well and very flattering,1
6674,I love this tee while it is true to size i feel it is meant to have a loose fit that being said it is a very flattering cut and has a great drape super comfy flattering and classic,1
6675,These pants fit great are soft comfy and flattering im and the length is perfect in a medium they wash well,1
6676,Love this tunic i bought it in black and wore it with skinny jeans and flat black boots and received many compliments can be dressed up for work or worn with distressed jeans on the weekend,1
6677,The print and front ruffle are beautiful the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model its almost like the sleeves have a life of their own so mismatched with this style of blouse such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape,0
6678,Very soft clean feel i got this in pink and received so many compliments perfect to layer on top of your favorite tee or tank i wish they had it in navy as well,1
6679,Well made garment i love the colors fabric and flounce at the bottom the top is a little large on top with large armholes but at least it will be cool on a hot summer day,1
6680,I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size the style allows you to put on a tshirt sweater cardigan t whatever and look completely put together i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them,1
6681,I own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra i tried to wear thong panties but they just didnt work for me thankfully natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable they also receive rave reviews from my husband,1
6682,I love this top the arms fit slender but the rest of the top is a nice loose fit i love the navy blue one with the print i normally dont like long tunics but its so flattering even for my short frame im usually a medium on top and bought the medium which was perfect,1
6683,I really wanted to love this dress but even though i got a small it was still too big i also dont think the horizontal pattern was a good look for me other than that it is beautiful and the fabric felt nice,1
6684,I love retailer sweaters always great quality and design this one is no exception i have the navy blue one and it fits well true to size,1
6685,This shirt works for both going out and going to work and i can wear it with everything fits perfect tucked and untucked tied and untied i love it,1
6686,I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray this top did not disappoint it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying i am not big busted so i didnt have the sizing issue that others seemed to have,1
6687,I debating this dress for a long time i just was hesitant because it is very form fitting i think this dress runs true to size after reading other reviews i was debating ordering a im normally an and i am glad i went with the it is form fitting the material is just absolutely beautiful and not stiff it is a bit thicker which will be nice in the fall colors are true to the pictures shown and length falls as shown on model,1
6688,After reading some reviews about it running small i decided to order the instead of my regular size and bingo im lb dress hits right above my knees im between slender and curvy,1
6689,I love this i bought it in the red color in person it is a deeper color than it looks online and it has some flecks of lighter yarn in it that just add to its beauty it is very soft and cozy it is warm without being hot i typically wear a smallsometimes medium at retailer i bought a medium only because i wanted it to be a little longer so that i could wear it with leggings and feel comfortable i am though so if you are shorter than you may not need to size up it looks great with a,1
6690,Never want to take this tee off so comfy neutral ecru stripe with a teeny bit sparklecolor is superb goes with a ton of items from my own closets need more in every colorprintstripejust feels ooh soooo good,1
6691,Ordered this on a whim in my normal size large and so glad i did its just beautiful the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers it has a soft fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual the sleeves have elastic it just flows nicely over the body and isnt oversized like so many tops theres a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back its a beauty,1
6692,Frustrated that retailer tops have been so short lately im and it hits at the top of my pants makes me look a bit boxy so disappointing because i wanted it for family photos otherwise the design is gorgeous having a hard time returning it but for the price point it probably has to go back,1
6693,I bought this at the store and when i picked it up i didnt think much of it until i tried it on it is so adorable i cant even tell you how much i am yo and normaly buy xss or in retailer mauve dresses are most of the time small chest and about lbs and i got the size and it is perfect i hope it is age appropriate tho i have traveling plans this summer and i am thinking this could be an easy thing to take along with me one piece clothing that will travel very we,1
6694,I love this jacket it is a perfect moto style jacket without being overly aggressive looking because it doesnt have the silver hardware instead all the hardware is black which gives it a cleaner minimalist look it is not super heavy it also has a cute blue and white striped lining which if you turn up the sleeves adds a surprise i bought it in a size small so that it was comfortable and i would be able to put a light sweater under it if i wanted to i generally take an xs or sometimes a s,1
6695,Beautiful and flattering i am a across the board but felt the small was too small ordering a medium cause i need this beauty for fall,1
6696,The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor im lbs ordered xxs petite first of all when i button this there is extreme gaping going on the vest runs narrow yet tallit shifts up my torso if i move at all making the gaping even worsethe skirt at the bottom is made of a very cheap thin slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled and it was just so thin it did not meet as closely in the middl,0
6697,This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer it is basically a big shaggy box from the front and from the side it looks like a tent it is also short,0
6698,I ordered this in the tangerine and it is so cute its very comfortable and flattering i wore a tank under it but didnt find it to be as sheer as other reviewers i paired it with slim pants brown suede ankle boots and a long necklace and it was one of the cutest outfits i have worn in a long time i got a lot of compliments i want this in tons of colorspatterns,1
6699,Another success so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer very lightweight yet not sheer design is even more appealing in person a must have for your closet,1
6700,I bought this tank in gold and the color is a beautiful ochre i love the length and the side slits which elevates the tunic from a simple basic the material is good quality and very comfortable im hoping to get a lot of wear out of this purchase,1
6701,Even following the care label exactly it shrunk inches in the length and overall in the diameter i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a workinappropriate mini after the first wash,0
6702,I am very happy with the topwell made and beautiful color,1
6703,This top is soo pretty with a cool edgeit looks and feels like really good quality,1
6704,I saw this online and loved it i wanted to wait for a sale and a promotion but this teeshirt sold out in the color holly completely sold out but for petite i bought a s and a m the small works it is comfortable it can be dressy or very casual i bought the white and the carbon it is a different style on a tee if you notice the front neck and the bottom of the back you will see what i mean i recommend this highly i cant imagine anyone not liking it,1
6705,I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price but the design really spoke to me ive been waiting for an off the shoulder piece that i love and this was it great light fabric and beautiful design i love it worth every penny can be worn on or off the shoulder like pictured,1
6706,Cant wait to wear this out for the holidays very comfortable and versatile looks great with the vegan leather moto pilcro pants or any black skinny jeans for a more dressed up look i was originally going to pair with dark gray pilcro but the black moto with black heels looked really great in the store dressing room beading is gorgeous and well done velvet trim makes it luxe in my opinion love that you dont need to pile on anything else to look polished top speaks volumes in and of,1
6707,Very flattering on fitted on top with a loose swingy bottom like most retailer tops it does run a little big i would size down if between sizes the material does seem a little fragile so im not sure how it will hold up i like the lookfit enough that i may get a nd color,1
6708,This is a beautiful top the fit is very flattering im tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow i wear it on the weekends and to workvery versatile i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry its the same size and no fadingnot sure about the others below with shrinkage issues highly recommend it,1
6709,I love this skirt maybe i love wrap skirts in general but many miss the mark this one is just right it does not have elastic waist band which always makes me look frumpy instead it is a side zip and allows for the tummy to stay flat as well as the pleats the embroidery is just enough and you may not be able to see the design of black on black in the fabric which makes the skirt i usually wear a size but the fit just right so you may want to size up,1
6710,I love this shirt its such a beautiful striking color yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute i bought another one of these when it went on sale so now i have two just in case haha,1
6711,Fabulous dress i was looking for that one dress that i could spend a little money on and wear to a variety of events mostly weddings i received tons of compliments and was very comfortable in it the hooks on the front of the dress to start to unhook themselves if you dont really clamp down on them but that was the only issue i dont know how flattering this would be on shorter ladies only because it ends right around your knees,1
6712,The knit is thin its more for a chilly spring or warm fall day but its not seethrough although a bit light weightthe style if figureflattering and fits tts i am short and i found the sleeves length perfect so if you are tall you might find this shorter in the arms or body on youi bought the purple and its a great color love it,1
6713,Perfection soft lived in feel and look without holes or rips and for someone who is ft in they are just the right length if i dont feel like cuffing the bottom fit tts,1
6714,Love love love fits great super comfortable and looks both casual and dressy at the same time i could wear this every single day,1
6715,I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high in fact two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid however as we were looking at the items we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality as the previous reviewer noted therefore none of us purchased the pantsthe staff at the store were very helpful,0
6716,I was thinking this was another maeve winner but this is actually plenty by tracy reese dress i love the flowy fabric the soft but vibrant colors and the gorgeous print i wanted a size mp but that sold out so i purchased a regular m with the intention to hem and i find it too large in the bust im going to order the sp instead too see if that fits better for reference i am dd,1
6717,I love this top the fit is great for me i ordered a small the color is a bit more peach than the pink in the picture but still very cute,1
6718,I ordered both colors in the xxs p knowing that size goes fast i used to wear xs or xs petite consistently but this last year i have found myself needing the smaller size vanity sizing in this case the xxs p was perfect for me length was around midthigh could almost wear as a dress if i were younger and not as muscular in my thighs the waist and chest are fitted but not snug fitted in the sense that it follows my natural curves the flower patterns are so cute it does cut at the p,1
6719,It was very prettybut it ran very big sadly i had to return it,0
6720,I love flowers i love flowers on my basic tees even better simplecomfybut different from your every day plain old tee,1
6721,These culottes are comfortable and cool i am a size and am tall i ordered the medium the hemline hits me a little bit longer than the model also they are more of a bell shape on me rather than kind of a straight pant as shown on the model the pockets are great,1
6722,I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one ive owned with a flare style that works pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a nonobvious way i think the fabric is soft and warm i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint you may want to size down if youre not busty i am and m petite was the perfect length on me shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in days,1
6723,This sweater coat is so cute i agree with the other reviews it does run a little big i always wear s tops from retailerwas a little hesitant to order this in a s since i would be wearing it over thingsso glad i did the small is perfect so i would say it runs a little large i do think it is is a little over priced but i did get it at off and it was a treat for myself,1
6724,So cute great for over a swim suit or walking around town got these on sale xxs fit perfectly fabric is very soft pom poms add fun styling,1
6725,These relaxed fit jeans are super soft they do run a size large i am a size in the stilt style and the in these fit well with a little room,1
6726,I think this will work well on very busty hourglass figuresor very petite frames but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular and my shoulders are broader than my hips wa b chest i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops and had i kept this i would have gone with the mthis shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep above my elbow and made my arms look huge fyi the v neck is very de,0
6727,Once again retailer delivers a beautiful quality dress i love it it is comfortable and flattering the material is lightweight enough that i will be able to wear into spring,1
6728,The color and fit of this dress is fabulous i cant wait to wear it out casual with flats or dressy with heels love it,1
6729,This skirt is perfect im a size and im years old ive really been wanting a tulle skirt but didnt want to look like baby huey in it a bip puffy tutu above my knees this skirt is indicative of the quality that is bailley the fit is great the length is perfect i plan to wear it with a chambray shirt and the burgundy colored obi belt,1
6730,Great top very easy to wear looks great with jeans or dressier pants,1
6731,Love these pajama bottoms they are so comfortable and the print is fun and unique i highly recommend they run true to size and have a great length they look short on the model but mine are perfect,1
6732,I love this sweater it is a beautiful color and i love the boxy shape very soft,1
6733,This dress rules so comfy and versatile flattering cut great with flats wedges booties boots with tights easily my new fav runs large i am usually a and the was perfect after i steamed it no button gap either i am a c,1
6734,I love the colors and style of this poncho however the fabric is a total miss it is so scratchy i developed a serious rash within the first hour of wering it also unfortunately the fabric is not woven tightly so the poncho does not keep you warm the wind whips right through it it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back,0
6735,This dress really was huge and not at all flattering i dont know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture material was nice and soft but i really dont see how anyone could look good in this no matter what your body shape is,0
6736,I absolutely adore this dress i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size but the was still available so i snagged it im glad because the dress runs small and the size would have been snug around the waist the style is perfect and the dress is well made the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly i dont think its too white like some reviewers have stated you cant wear a bra with this dress but t,1
6737,I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the halflength banded sleeves it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear it looks like silk although it is synthetic i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and youre done and ready for work or going out to an event it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built,1
6738,I was so excited to get this classiclooking retailer dress i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print the popsicle print on this dress is really truly adorable unfortunately the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest and im only a b ladies so be warned at the same time the arm holes were huge i mean massively big i think if you have a swimmers body this might work otherwise youll for sure nee,0
6739,This is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while it covers all the important parts without being too baggy i found the fabric to be light and comfortable but heavy enough that a light colored bra cant be seen underneath with it great if you dont feel like wearing multiple layers,1
6740,I love the fabric since its fall wasnt expecting it to be light but its not heavy either just the right balancethis is one of those classics i love the collage like pattern of the fabricthe fit is true to size and looks great with bootieboots dressed up or down,1
6741,This tunic is true to size i ordered the xxs as i am lbs it fit perfectly and hit me about inches above the knee similar to model photo i have long torso it has a very sparingly done cluster of sparkle sequence the draw string waist has a tie on each side to adjust length i actually returned it only because it seemed a little to young a look for me i was sorry to do so,1
6742,I love bowsthis dress is very cute and flattering while being comfortable it may be sleeveless but i think with the right boots and cardigan it can be brought into fall easily color is a nice green i tried on both the p and p and though i loved the fit of the p better width i preferred the length of the p otherwise not much difference there i think it is well worth keeping it even though i dont need yet another dress material is pretty comfortable too back is lower,1
6743,Quality assembledcomfortable and stylish with tone fabric wash wo shrinkagepair with every rainbow color nice alternative to jean days,1
6744,This is a beautiful top its unique and not so ordinary i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest although i had a baby this year and i am nursing so that could be why if i bought again i would size up,1
6745,I really like this vest personally i think it is difficult to find vests that fit properly this is a good one fabric and color good the photo is very representative of the color no surprises there arm holes are not too big which is often a problem the detail on the back gives it some added interest the only thing i would mention that could be a negative is that it is short especially in the back again the picture is representative but do pay attention to the length and be certain that,1
6746,I agree that the color in the picture online is lighter but i bought it from the store and really like that it isnt just another offwhite sweater it fits true to size and i love the quality it is really beautiful,1
6747,Love love love this blouse the cut outs at the top just add to its elegance,1
6748,This is a beautiful sweater,1
6749,This dress is gorgeous it is better in person than online i love the detail of the pleats and the waist it is light weight and perfectly lines and a beautiful dress for twirling with a martini in hand in fact my sister tried to steal it from during a recent trip to europe it is that adorable and flattering highly recommend,1
6750,I ordered the xl in white for fit its true to size it matches the models photos its a comfortable top the shape is good with the pleating but the color is definitely off its as if the white fabric was prewashed with navy its not the fresh crisp white shown at least for the one i received the quality of the material is basic the black version might be the better one overall im going to exchange the white one i have to give that a try overall i dont think its worth ful,0
6751,Pretty cant wait to wear this in the fall design is understated yet pretty nice ponchoswing style havent worn it yet so i cant rate the durability or wash experience yet glad i got this on sale,1
6752,I had my eye on this dress since it fist came out but hesitated to order due to some of the lower reviews when i got a chance to try it on i loved it i did go up a size i am so i had it shortened to above the knee i didnt mind losing the unfinished hem had the hem match that of the pockets i am a c but the bodice is stable and even if i pull at it it stays put so happy to find this especially on sale i plan to wear it at our company party which is help on a large charter bo,1
6753,I am a loyal retailer shopper but find many items are hit or miss this definitely is a hit especially in black i am lbs and ddd i usually take a m or m petite in retailer tops because this is flowy and long a s petite fits perfectly the style is oneofakind the lace is heavy and top quality and when you try on the right size it hits perfectly the lavender is a dusty shade that wont work well in fallwinter it would look wonderful in cranberry or forest green,1
6754,Love these i am a medium in shorts or and the medium fit perfectly true to size very soft flattering cut and color love the embroidery great for travel very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals almost like a flirty little short skirt the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummyi am very happy with this purchase,1

6756,This dress immediately caught my eye in the store the colors are vibrant and the cut is flattering i wear a smaill and it fit perfectly the sweater material is not thick so it can be worn all year it is very versatile,1
6757,I purchased this dress in black a few months back i was so excited to see it back in multiple colors the black dress went well with riding boots and tights for colder temps the yellow dress will be great in warm temps with cute sandals super comfortable and flattering,1
6758,I just wore this dress tonight to my holiday party and received many compliments on it its so comfortable and even though the fabric is thick its not bulky or stiff like some embroidered fabric can be and the side pockets make a great addition too unlike other reviews i thought the armholes were perfect the cutout in the back is a nice touch and i was able to wear a regular bra with it the colors are beautiful and true to the pic i was not surprised by the brightness of it like othe,1
6759,I have this dress in red and black and im contemplating getting the green one its amazingly soft and falls beautifully really flattering and i just had a baby weeks ago its true to size im and lbs and got a small it should still fit fine once the rest of the baby weight is gone,1
6760,Im pearshaped so my inclination is to always grab an alinefitnflare style dress or skirt but for some reason this stood out to me and im glad i tried it on i love this dress im with a longer torso and this still went down to my knees so it definitely works for taller girls the cut is so flattering and along with the thicker material it gives me more of an hourglass shape that enhances my curves instead of making me want to camouflage them i got my dress in a size and its tt,1
6761,This dress is so beautiful on purchased in black motif and it can definitely be dressed up or down material is lightweight perfect for summer and the dress washed up beautifully in the washing machine i always wear an xs in maeve and the dress fits true to size,1
6762,The design of this shirt is stunning i cant even tell you how many people complimented me on the shirt the only thing is it does run a bit long with it being long it can go nicely with leggings and bootsmaterial is a bit thin and should be handwashed or dry cleaned i do wish there were more sizes in petite,1
6763,This feels and looks like a ballet skirt on so light and flowy super comfortable just love it extremely flattering cut tiny gathered folds at waistband add pretty detail and create a slimming effect on my tummy whats not to love great pockets too i have a inseam and the length is perfect ordering in both colors now as i can see these becoming my go to bottoms all summer long,1
6764,The top of this dress is very flattering there is a lot of fabric on the bottom half of dress if you want something which hugs curves this is not it however one of the things i like about this dress is it can be dressed up or down i wore to a wedding and got several compliments very comfortable,1
6765,Well made gorgeous skirt that can be worn with heels and lace top or tee shirt and big jewelry true to size i am a and the extra small was great poofs out a bit but not like youre a fairy i would say the blue which i ordered is more of a seafoam mint green which is also lovely and spring time,1
6766,This dress is lovely the soft material is prettier in person and the fit is perfect for me i found it tts wearing my normal s im and it hits me a little lower towards my ankles than pictured but doesnt the floor it will be perfect for an upcoming wedding rehearsal lunch and a go to summer dress after that,1
6767,I actually love the thickness of the cotton fabric on this top i am tired of too thin shirts that develop holes right away i love the color tooi am usually a medium and the medium fits well if a little roomy,1
6768,Just got this in a petite lbs b and it fits perfectly the length is right at the bottom of the knee it is fitted tight at the waist and the belt is even more beautiful in person this dress has some weight and the quality seems excellent there is a scalloped nude lining that is attached to the dress and the dress can be unzipped from the bottom as wellthere is a darker lace fabric under the armpit which i like since it hides your armpits much better than the sheer red lace fab,1
6769,Even at a very deep discount this piece is definitely not worth the money the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design which would be coolwhich is largely what attracted me to it but as i discovered when it arrived that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo so this image is rather misleading the actual jacket is very thinmore like a shirt with an open front than a jacket the pockets are just loosely tacked inside for,0
6770,Easy breezy summer dress love the detailing under the arms,1
6771,Quality is fantastic but i feel like a would have barely made its way around one leg this pant is way small in terms of sizing and not a style fit for anyone over a a lot of fabric in the legs nice pant but not for this girl,0
6772,I have been looking for a black dress for a few events i have coming up this winter and have not been able to find anything suitable i have tried a few things from free people but being everything there is just too short for these particular events when i saw this dress i had to have it it has the same feel as some of the free people dresses but the length is so much better the dress itself is sheer and not intended for extended outdoor wear but really beautiful on dress up with som,1
6773,I originally got these in a petite and thought they fit great right out of the bag im usually a and within an hour of wearing them to retailer actually the knees had gotten so baggy that they looked absolutely ridiculous ive never had jeans do this the salesperson at retailer agreed that they seemed very odd i exchanged for a p at her suggestion and i just hate them id say the smaller size seems every so slightly small but nothing major but the waist actually folds over a,0
6774,I was very patient with this dress i was waiting almost forever till this dress gets on sale when i tried my usual size it was way too tight but i could zip it i am lbs the dress covers my knees and its a perfect length so when i sit it does not show too much of my length so its a work friendly it has side pockets which can be very comfortable as well the cut is great its a linethe thickness of material makes belly look great in case if you care i also like color a,1
6775,I saw this dress online and really wanted to love it unfortunately it wasnt at all as expected in personas the previous reviewer mentioned it is extremely itchy material which was already pilling on many of the dresses displayed in the store the neck was extremely tight a problem ive never encountered with any retailer dress additionally it seems to have a kangaroo pocket located right underneath the bust line which protruded in an unflattering way the pocket is not at all not,0
6776,I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem but it is somewhat boxy and flowy which didnt seem to work on my curvy body proportionwise,1
6777,I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top buyers beware you will not get the same top delivered to you as is shown in this picture the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all and while there is a bow in the back the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow i hate to write a bad review but come on retailer id never expect this from you it looks like any other peplum white top not something special like the picture is o,0
6778,Love the look of this poncho which is not as largebillowy as i thought it would be i tried it on as a whim in the store and fell in love the colors are more beige than gray for those of you with paleblue underdone complexions it may wash you out love the orange knit running through to give it a little pop im pounds and the hem was a bit cropped on me may want to consider a tank top or tshirt underneath,1
6779,I was a little hesitant to order it i am glad i did it is a great top,1
6780,I adore the tiny brand blouses this one is lovely and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy embroidered material very pretty indeed this probably is equally stunning in the nude color but it doesnt show well somehow online the navy is certainly amazing and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off the large fits me perfectly although i am a medium in most all other tops,1
6781,This is a great layering tank that is super comfy the sale price is a bargain,1

6783,The stitched vneck tunic is a very charming piece to your wardrobe it is soft and feminine and has added charm with the fringed bottomit is a comfortable piece that looks great with leggings or skinnystraight jeans it is a loose fitting design so it is a bit large opt for a smaller size if you prefer a closer fit to your curves,1
6784,The metal detail the shoulders is the perfect touch to an otherwise ordinary tee regarding sizing i am dd and i usually have to buy l in tops and make alterations after reading the other reviews i ordered a m s because my shoulders are narrow the s fit better front measurement shoulder to hem is on both the s and the m plenty of length for me i also wasnt looking for a tight fit around the waist and tucking in just the front as shown on the model looks great i saw thi,1

6786,This is a very substantial warm sweater that is so classy and super soft and just different enough really great with neutral sweater leggings or jeans with boots you have to wear a longer tank or tee underneath as it it split on the sides but the belt cinches the whole sweater in,1
6787,I just got this today love it the embroidery on the front is gorgeous rich looking the material is soft has a nice weight so that it drapes perfectly is not at all see through it will look great with sandals flats or sandals with heels i wear an xs it fits tts it falls just above the knee i can see me wearing this a lot i was worried about it looking too youthfull for my age but it doesnt at all,1

6793,I could live in this top its versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer the color offerings are basic enough to match anything and its comfortable enough to wear around the clock note that it runs small i had to size up to a medium even though of everything else i wear is size small,1
6794,I ordered this top despite the other reviews and im very glad i did it is adorable well made and very flattering i am usually a size xs or but based on the reviews sized up to a fits perfectly not snug at all highly recommend,1
6795,I saw the colors and texture of this top and wanted to love it however when i put it on it just did not work the cut was so strange it runs very small in the shoulders and then flairs out so much at the waist i even ordered up a size based on reviews i ordered an when i normally where a small in things the shoulders were still too small and it was way too big every where else,0
6796,Easy to wear with black or grey i will wear as a work jacket not necessarily just an outwear piece,1
6797,I fell in love with this shirt in the store and it has become one of my favorite items in my closet the bright pink contrasts perfectly with the white peplum bottom and the fit is wonderfully flattering,1
6798,This top is super comfy and easy to wear i found it to be a bit darker tan than it looks online but still quite cute its flowy but still gives you shape overall it was a great buy,1
6799,This price is amazing and goes with everything fits great so glad i made this purchase,1
6800,I love the cut of these pants kind of a flare kind of a boot cut and super flattering they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg i consider them more pants then denim,1
6801,I absolutely love these capris after reading the reviews i thought that they may fit a bit snug through the thigh but they fit perfectly i am roughly a size six depending on the design i can sometimes squeeze into a i bought the size in these and its perfect also i thought that the green would be more of a mint but its definitely a more of a mossy color i love that they are so versatile and literally go with everything will be getting more colors in the future great buy,1
6802,I bought this shirt in white i have worn it ways so far and love it i wore it under a pull over and had the tail ends stick out and it was great that way and i wore it with a long cardigan i received a lot of compliments on it i will be buying it in red,1
6803,I ordered this top in xsp and xs i dont think i let the xsp top breathe long enough because i thought it was too short and sent it back there is no retailer near me i kept the xs and at first thought the same thing about it not fitting right but by the end of the day it stretched just enough and felt just right really pretty top i received a lot of compliments on it,1
6804,I tried this on at antho today and loved it the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors it is flattering in person the fabric is a light fabrici was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer but this is probably better anyway with spring coming it is coming righttoday its snowing i like the underlayer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it it is versatile and could be paired with anything,1
6805,Adorable very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit im sure ill wear this with jeans as pictured but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt,1
6806,The cutout design of this suit looks cute on the model but didnt flatter my shape i think it would work better on someone very thin the crisscross fabric portion was a bit baggy and didnt sit right even worse the bust portion made me look flat and im a full c cup,0
6807,I bought this to wear with a skirt that i wanted to dress down i needed something that was long enough to be able to tuck it in without having that awkward line its a great fit,1
6808,I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding and couldnt be happier im very curvy dd and the medium fit like a glove the fabric has a great s vibe while the fit is extremely classic i have never felt more beautiful and received many compliments i am and it hit just to the top of my feet i highly recommend,1
6809,Ladies dont let this beauty get away never paid much attention to it online but went into local retailer today and it was returned by someone i couldnt get it on fast enough it is gorgeous runs tts i took the small for reference i am c top and petite this will work on any body type you wont be sorry well worth the money for the style and fabric,1
6810,I dont normally review my purchases but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made i couldnt help myself but to post a review the neck line isnt even hemmed down so it flaps up the material is thin and feel cheap this dress isnt even worth in my opinion i was expecting a well made good quality dress for the high price tag,0
6811,Love color and fabric are beautiful new fav,1
6812,The perfect simple black top great fit can be dressed up or down closet staple,1
6813,I love this cut of shirt the stripes are fun i did have to go up a size due to my bust dd which made the lower part a little bit more flowy regardless i still love this top so much that i have bought of the prints available,1
6814,Theres a free people version of this top and this by far surpasses the fit of it im and purchased the xl and it fits me exactly like the model i would say it is tts and extremely soft,1
6815,This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love it is breezy and easy comfortable but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print you can wear it with some cute flipflops or polish it up with some cute boots,1
6816,This top is really cute and i love the design however the first time i wore it the waste band started unraveling,0
6817,Im lbs and ordered a large it fit but the arms were awkwardly short the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right which would be okay however the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isnt even finished with any stitching its just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isnt sewnit would unravel with washing its soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on supersale and dont mind it com,0
6818,Pilcro has become my go to brand for pants as they always seem to fit with consistent sizing im an and size never fails to fit perfectly ive got hips and a booty so its great to have a brand that works with my curves these chinos are super soft and feel like pants ive had for years broken in but still look polished i bought the green which is really teal and feel in love with them ive since bought the gray and sandkhaki color im and the length hits just below,1
6819,I have gotten constant compliments on this dress and it is very flattering i normally wear a large or a size and i had to order this in an xl i am big busted so that makes the differencethis could be so easily dressed up but easily made casual with a denim jacket or sweaterone of my favorite fall purchases,1
6820,This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures fit is true to size perfect drape lined not clingy just perfect in every way its at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell outgrab it now in your size while you can only con i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes but maybe they make it in petite,1
6821,This is such a fun version of a vneck tshirt the lines and seams are very flattering the neckline is perfect im a size depending and i ordered the medium in the navy which fit perfectly the length was slightly shorter on me than the model overall a great shirt highly recommended,1
6822,I love this dress the pattern is super cute and looks great with a jean jacket and comfy sandals or white sneakers tons of compliments,1
6823,I ordered this when i first saw it on line but it was backordered it just arrived today and i am so very happy with it so feminine kind of vintage yet modern the epitome of the retailer aesthetic i typically wear a p a ft in in tracy reese and the p is perfect i gave a for quality only because it is polyester however that also keeps the price down it seems that every summer plenty by tracy reese comes out with a dress that becomes my go to favorite and this year is,1
6824,I love the way this dress hangs straight down on the model but on me it looked tacky im and lbs and this dress hit me in all the wrong places i got a size small sizing up would be huge in the top of the dress and the arm holes are already dangerously large i wish this were just a little bit aline instead its literally like someone just extended the length of a tshirt,0
6825,Love the style of this vest and an added bonus is how soft it is every vest is different though so if youre shopping in the store be sure to look at all of them,1
6826,I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well,1
6827,Got so many complements really comfy but runs big im usually a large and i wish i had gotten the small,1
6828,This tank was much needed for my wardrobe i love the vivid colors and forgiving cut i am lbs and purchased an xs,1
6829,This shirt is such a beautiful color the lavender is a really lovely addition to spring wardrobe and goes with more than imagined it has a bit of an oversized fit although it falls really nicely on slimmer silhouettes its also incredibly comfy and stylish with an updated look even to the most casual of attire,1
6830,This shirt is so cute with the cutout stripes and it goes with everything its easy to wear and true to size you can dress it up or dress it down the fabric is soft but also light weight i am so happy to own this classic piece,1
6831,This dress is amazing the photos do not do it justice runs a tad large definitely can size down,1
6832,Love this top you can really fess up i ordered in a small i am and pounds,1
6833,These jeans are beautiful as the other reviewers have notedthey run very largelike sizes even then they are very stretchy the embroidery is dark blue looks black on screenlovely pair of jeans if they had other colors i would by them,1
6834,This is a very pretty sweater a bit boxy and short but cute i am and ordered the regular xs in black the thing i did not like about this sweater was the gold thread through the back lace i would have kept this if it was plain black lace just did not like that look,0
6835,Me waist hips bought the size im expecting a bit of stretch to allow a bit more room for the booty spandex and they seem like standard cartonnier charlie fiti love the kicky cropped flaretheyre described as grey motif but everyone in store and i agree called them green the main diamonds are forest green with a greygreen inset and a bluegrey inset inside that whewthey come with an extra button keep it as those tiny buttons are going to be first,1
6836,This is my favorite find of the fall i got the mustard color and it is wonderful very soft nice shape unique design i am usually between a medium and large in tops but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking i am ft in tall even sizing up its far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned but looks great with jeans and boots the large is perfect,1
6837,This top is really nice and the fabric is more substantial than it looks in the photo it has a great shape and is nicely made i ordered an xs which i nesrly always wear but i measure in the bust and it fits well but no extra room im petite and it is not too oversized really cute top and a great value,1
6838,I hate to be so negative but i cant believe this shirt has so many positive reviews it is stiff silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse looks cheap,0
6839,All the rave reviews are true this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it im having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this this is a great three season layering piece and im thrilled i was able to get it on sale my only regret was the lack of a petite selection,1
6840,I was so bummed to see how quickly this top sold out online in the black however to my delight i happened to stumble upon the shirt in my size in my local store recently knowing it was sold out online i immediately grabbed it to try on big mistake i instantly fell in love im a curvy woman d chest wide hips small waist and a slight tummy and this shirt fits beautifully in my usual size which is a medium in deletta hugs my figure without making me look big i work in an office wh,1
6841,I tried this blouse on and loved the style comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me buti also tried the blue and it gets stars as the fabric is much better it too is adorable soft and did not tear on gentle testing the two blouse colors are made from different,0
6842,This is a great dress i purchased the red and gold motif i like that it is versatile and very comfortable plus it has pockets love that i am fuller in the bottom so i was concerned with the pockets adding bulk so far so good,1
6843,Love this jacket this picture shows the sleeves rolled down but in the stores they have them rolled up and i have to say that is how youll most likely wear it as the sleeves might be too short if you rolled them down however it is still a fabulous fall coat it does run slightly large but it depends on how you want it to fit i am typically a medium and i bought the ml because the xss was a little fought in the shoulders i bought last weekend and already wore twice because it looks gre,1
6844,This dress is thin and completely see through it is definitely not worth the price tag would be really cute in a thicker material,0
6845,Lovely top flattering and dressy would definitely get another color if they have it,1
6846,So to put this in some perspective when i tried on this dress for my husband after bringing it home he described it as possibly the best dress youve ever bought so thats definitely a winner i think what makes the dress great is that its not clingy but still had a good drape on the skinny models it looks large and flowy but on my curvier body it draped beautifully and is super flattering without being clingy or too tight im usually a size ddd and i sized down to a medium s,1
6847,This dress is especially beautiful in person the tulle doesnt snag and lays nice and flat not point this dress is easy to dress up or dress down fits comfortably and has some stretch to it the bodice does run a little high higher than what is shown in the model picture but lovely nonetheless,1
6848,Love this dress runs big though size down,1
6849,I have been wearing joes jeans for years and have a hefty stable of varieties in my wardrobe recently pairs of their skinny leggings have worn out much quicker than expected which has caused me to question their construction and overall durability i have had my eye on these pilco legging jeans for a while but every time i have gone to pull the trigger my size has been sold out finally all the stars aligned just as i bid my final pair of joes skinnys adieu and i was able to purchase,1
6850,I love this crushed velvet dress in the rich blue color i plan to wear it with short peep toe boots and also with ankle leggings and flats so glad velvet is in this year,1
6851,I love this top fits true to size tunic length thin comfy fabric adorable subtle print the perfect top,1
6852,I received these pants today and theyre perfect as another reviewer stated i would definitely not wear these for lounging you can dress them up or down i feel like these will be my favorite goto pants this spring i highly recommend the design and pockets are perfect,1
6853,I bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since i love that you can wear it either on or offtheshoulder the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy comfortable and easy to wear on the shoulder ive even worn it to work on casual friday the print is versatile and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey i definitely recommend especially since i notice it is now on sale it is generously sized so id recommend erring,1
6854,Nice dark indigo with minimal fading medium denim thickness with stretch i bought size and it is snug but doesnt squeeze my hip is and waist love these i will be getting them hemmed up to ankle length i am and find the little kick out at the ankle from getting them shortened to be very cute and classy if you keep them full length to your shoe they will have a slightly baggier bootcut look these remind me of my point sur hightower straight leg jeans with maybe an,1
6855,Great with a tank top underneath and jeans i also wore with a delicate gold necklace charming,1
6856,Such a beautiful pattern i think you could wear it with a skirt and it wouldnt even read as a bathing suit love the lacy pattern in front great fit i bought a medium when i usually wear a small in retailer it fits a little loose so id probably buy a small if i bought another one but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit,1
6857,This top is wonderfully comfortable and well made ive taken a few accidental naps while wearing it because i was just so comfortable at the same time i receive complements on the shirt every time i wear it itt pairs well with so many types of pants the only negative is that i only own one the cream color i regret greatly that i did not purchase it in all available colors when i had the chance i really hope to see this top come back again later,1
6858,Obsessed with these pants i have them in the green color and was looking for them to go on sale great fit very comfortable,1
6859,Love this romper once on feels comfy like pjs but looks put together i find bending forward at the waist helps to get it off and on tiny complaint is that the top snap shows even when closed that is minor the rest is all good,1
6860,I love this shirt beautiful casual wear great with jeans,1
6861,I added this to a stack of tryons on my trip to retailer today not expecting to be impressed by this number but was blown away when i tried it on dollars is a little pricey but didnt hesitate it was so beautiful i am a b and normally wear a size and the small fit perfectly cant wait to wear it on vacation in new orleans in a couple of weeks,1
6862,Very comfortable and stylish can wear with tights as a dress or over jeans cute any way the material is not super thick but not too thin,1
6863,I bought this to celebrate my birthday i get a new suit every year it was a milestone birthday and this dress did not disappoint,1
6864,I was eyeing this blouse when the catelog was mailed to me earlier this year i never got a chance to try it on in stores but when i saw it online and on sale i snagged it what i didnt realize was the intricate design of this blouse ithas really pretty lace all over the top and then fine beading securely sewn on the blouse has crochet sleeve designs and also a very pretty neck bib area it fits me tts and very comfortably i love the airy feeling of it and it actually also isnt too long on,1
6865,Couldnt make it work even belted ivory color is darker irldingy light tan like dirty vintage drop waist is not dropped at all just a maternityish cut that starts boxyloose high up below bust then abruptly flares out at bellybutton level not low hip into the skirt i usually find aline cuts good at giving illusion of a willowy curvy waist but this does notadds ten pounds poly fabric heavyhot rayon lining awkward and doesnt flowdrape lb a tried xs,0
6866,This top is very easy to wear its a great versatile and unique piece the textile is really soft and i found quite special it is pretty lightweight and the sleeves have some great stripes of more sheer fabric,1
6867,This is a beautiful dress the dress is a lighter blue when compared to the picture and the fabric is thick but the shape is beautiful the waist is very fitted but it didnt feel uncomfortable i didnt think the fabric was itchy as others mentioned i do think it is a bit short on the front it is a high low dress but at that is not a problem for me it was true to size for me lbs c,1
6868,I just received this it is adorable well made with attention to detail the cotton is soft and it hugs the body well in the right places the pattern is actually sewn into the cotton very cool it has a sophisticated elegant and urban vibe to it this one is a winner,1
6869,These shorts are great for warm weather they look great with a navy top the pattern is very attractive they are on the baggy side but the style is very flattering,1
6870,Its still a bit cool here in minnesota however it wont be long before i can wear this lightweight drapey but figureflattering blouse i am ft in and the petite fits well,1
6871,This skirt is a show piece the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering for different body types i got my usual size even though i have a smaller waist and larger hips and thighs the skirt looks cute with the splitback buttondown by cloth and stone you will not regret buying this piece,1
6872,They have all the features ive been searching forthe leg is straight not tapered or fitted the fabric is soft with an authentic wornin look the overall look is casual relaxed and cool i love these chinos and definitely plan to buy more,1
6873,And this one has a heavenly feel to it i know its not cashmere but its soft and cozy i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutralcreme sweater perfect to take from fall into winter,1
6874,These are the perfect pants for the hourglass figure i needed sz but the store was sold out in my sz plan to order these pants are light weight and fit in all the right spots dont show any flaws on legs and i do have them but they are very complimentary to my figure they are also really hip without being over the top or weird,1
6875,I was so bummed by this dress i had high hopes when i ordered it but was surprised by the poor quality and cheap materials when it arrived the body of the dress is unlined fleece material it reminded me of material that they make cheap halloween costumes out of i found the fit baggy and unflatteringthe shawl portion is only attached at the very top of the shouldersvery disappointed i already returned this,0
6876,If you are going for a ridiculously high priced ugly sweater contest this is the one for you i normally like clothing with some character and juxtaposition but this one did not do it for me i cannot imagine the collar fitting right or flattering anyone and the mixed layers end up making it look cheap rather than trendy,0
6877,The details on this top are absolutely gorgeous from the lace to the sequins to the rhinestones that said the details are not overpowering yet more subtle cant wait to wear this over the holiday season sure to get tons of compliments,1
6878,It is so cute in the picture but wasnt flattering on me it also felt like i couldnt raise my arms while wearing it i love retailer and will be a forever fan but this dress just wasnt for me,0
6879,Looks great it is more off whitetan then white though,1
6880,I was looking for the perfect july th weekend dress with enough room to be comfy and eat while also being chic and feeling cutei got countless compliments on this dress the design is adorable and the fit is really flattering im and i weigh about i normally would have worn a small but i had to spring for the petite xs the design is a bit big and billowy and anything else would have swallowed me upoverall great purchase i am in love,1
6881,Another wonderful deletta top is hanging in my closet i love the cotton i love the style medium fit perfect it is loose around the middle so soft and comfortable i purchased the lavender washout i know i will be wearing this frequently,1
6882,The pictures dont do this dress justice it is fantastic the fit is perfect and it is super comfortable while still looking polished a must have dress,1
6883,Another winner for me this top drapes wonderfully the lace is beautiful and looks fabulous on i would highly recommend it,1
6884,I agree with the first reviewer exactly beautiful fabric and idea of dress looks stunning on model but huge and shapeless in person like a tent not at all what i expected when ordering a petite sadly has to be returned,0
6885,I am and lbs and could have worn the or but took the it does run short and the length in the was better than the with arm hole size being the same the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one it has great style,1
6886,These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down,1
6887,This shirt looked cute until i tried it on worst fit ever im thin and this style of top is usually quite flattering but this one missed the mark big time,0
6888,Id been eyeing this for a long time but couldnt afford the full price when it came on sale my size regular was sold out so i took a chance and went with the petite only difference is length and am i glad i didit fits beautifully even a little roomy but the length is perfect the longer pieces are atbarely below the knee and the shorter flap is about two inches above for reference im pounds measurements the skirt is substantial with highqualit,1
6889,I really love this shirt the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style i thought the fit was perfect im lbs and i ordered an xs still enough room to be comfortable super cute glad i bought it,1
6890,Hello i could not see how this dress could get anything but a star review the only thing that i thought would be a negative is that it may stag easily other than that this dress is stunning on and i feel it runs large i wear a sz and the xs fit just right im ft in tall looks great with a high heel since its really long to the floor which i like as far as the shine on this dress i love it it makes it worth the price and dresses up a casual dress and its very comfortable,1
6891,I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on its a fresh shape that is truly flattering i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate i bought the in peach all the colors are very pretty i am a usual medium and am f so the regular brafriendliness is essential this is a new fuller shape for me im on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer and this is a lovely choice you could pair it w,1
6892,I am lbs size shortlegged and these jeans fit perfectly ive learned that pilcros serif fit is my go to and these did not disappoint not only are they a flattering fit they are the ideal medium blue denim and they arent covered in excessive whiskering which seems to plague most jeans,1
6893,This top is extremely well made the fabric is so soft the style is very stylish it is very figure flattering and chic a keeper im petite and the style is not overwhelming,1
6894,Even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse but im so happy i did the fabric looks as high quality inperson as it does in the picture and it isnt seethrough the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop the buttons down the back are a fun cute detail and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out,1
6895,I wasnt all that impressed with this dress on the hanger but i am so glad i tried it on it is super comfortable very flattering and can be worn multiple ways spot on,1
6896,Bought this in dark grey which has a lovely bluish hue the fabric is soft comfy and it has great lines for a knit fabric very flattering the sleeves are nice and long,1
6897,I love this top although it is a tad big i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big however i am still able to wear it without any nerves that its too big hope that makes sense the navy was more lovely with my skin hair but the yellow was so pretty too,1
6898,This sweater is warm and cozy it has flattering lines the way it closes the banded detail at the hem and sleeve details please remember it is wool so right next to your skin my be itchy however it is the best sweater for a slim flattering warm look,1
6899,I have this tee in every single color and love it this shirt is so soft airy and comfortable and the ribbon embellishment on the back dresses it up a little i love wearing leggings or skinny jeans with it and accessorizing with an infinity scarf i normally wear a size small but i sized up to a medium this time there is very little difference in the two sizes but i liked the modest increase in length im glad that i did this because the tees shrunk ever so slightly after being in the d,1
6900,Absolutely love love this dress it is so comfortable and falls perfectly the material is great and you can dress it up or wear it casually if it had more colors i would get it it in any color it came in,1
6901,Super flattering stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs i love these,1
6902,I tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress,0
6903,These jeans not only fit well i love the way the fabric feels for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin i am and the inseam of inches was perfect they call them hirise but them seem more like a midrise to me which i prefer i am going to buy another pair in a different wash,1
6904,This top when pulled out of the box didnt look like much the contrast of the buttons wrinkly shapeless but when i shook it out tried it on i fell in love its so simple and versatile prob the best white shirt i purchased this year id say it pretty flowly but thats the style and i love it i am lbs and purchased a small i would purchase again and in other colors if they had them,1
6905,These pants are so warm and cozy and comfortable they are like cashmere for your legsso amazingly soft and for that price its definitely worth getting all the colors,1
6906,I am a huge fan of all things mother brand now they fit great and are true to size they have just the right amount of stretch but maintain their fit all day,1
6907,This is a gem stretchy graphic easy to wear lightweight and so fun the best thing about this is it can be worn as a jumpsuit or as a higher waisted pant ive seen it paired with a pilcro denim jacket and cute sandals and then worn as pants with a black tank jacket and silver belt i love that this can be dressed up or downyou could even throw it on over your bathing suit as a coverup i would go true to size on this one since there is some room and the top has great stretch,1
6908,I am currently wearing this dress i wear it whenever i can get away with it i have it in red and it works incredible on my coloring the front is modest enough for work while the back is sweet and unexpected,1
6909,Not for shorties im and will need to get them hemmed,1
6910,Material is awful not soft at all colors are much darker than shows online it is actually very short not at all as it looks on the model it went back,0
6911,I was struggling with the options above does it fit true to size or is it too small or too large it is both too small and too large which is really strange the model makes this shirt look stunning but the product is actually very boxy i am weigh lbs and i typically order anywhere from a prxxsxs i ordered this shirt in an xsp and the shirt sleeves were short and the middle was boxy quite frankly it looked like a maternity shirt and the structure was not worth the money,0
6912,Loved this sweater coat the first time i saw it onlinethen the priceyikes the style color and fabric design is beautiful waited for it to sale and then hurray an extra off to my local store for a try on as i would not have wanted to even try it at the regular price it is wonderful it runs very large i went down two sizes to achieve the fit i was looking for from a large to a small in my opinion the product shot model is wearing a size too large even sizing down it is not t,1
6913,I love this top i think the knit rib quality is quite lovely and the color is gorgeous i bought the plum color and got many compliments while wearing it i like that its a little on the longer side i wore it with my pullon ponte pants and booties very cute,1
6914,Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points great fit flattering silhouette comfortable fabric shape enhancing cut and the easiest casual style ever i got the p and my body is dd,1
6915,Plan to wear this with pants may not fit some body types due to the tie and cocoon sleeve styling but i recommend trying on before deciding truly stunning athough the weight of the silk is very light would have been better at this price point if it was heavier weight but still not a bad value,1
6916,So i want to start off by saying the quality of this shirt really was great as was the pattern unfortunately if youre going off the picture know that they definitely pinned in the sides on the model this shirt has a full on triangle shape and flares significantly towards the bottom its not a straight fit as the picture would suggest im sure this works for some women but if youre muscular with an already vshape to your body meaning your shoulders are significantly sized and you have,0
6917,Oh my i love this tee it is super soft i love how it doesnt look like a sack with no shape i cant wait to get more colors i am tall plus have a long torso and it still is long enough for me so this is definitely a win,1
6918,I very rarely pay full price for anything let alone this much for a tshirt but i actually paid full price for this in two colors thats how much i love this shirt the pink and the turquoise are beautiful and im thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas i love how heavy the weight is the length of the torso is long enough the length of the sleeves is actually long enough i love the ribbon down the back its flattering and comfy and perfect im lbs b and the small fit,1
6919,This poncho is perfect the slits on the side may seem intimidating at first but wear a flowy tank under neath it for a nice added detail its easy to wear over a fitted dress as well or a highwaisted full skirti have red hair and the gold looks amazing with that hair color but the grey and creme are neutral and go well with a lot of options,1
6920,This is stunning its almost snug for a im lb but that might be because its strapless its constructed with a bra inside so you can get away without wearing one i cant wait to wear this and im going to have to find an event good enough to deserve this dress i feel like audrey hepburn in this,1
6921,Lovely dress i was a bit hesitant as a reviewer mentioned the fabric being irritable but luckily i had no issues the regular is long and i have to wear it with my wedge but im ok with that,1
6922,Soft comfortable flattering versatilewhat more can you ask for just wish it came in a longsleeved version,1
6923,I am in love with this top i was a little nervous because im on the bustier side ddd but it works for me so i say give it a shotyou never know im hoping for more tops like this in the fall line,1
6924,What can i say this is a winner it is stunning gorgeous a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet it is classic early s look which is exactly my style i am usually a or a so i went with a based on the reviews and it fits divinely i dont need another orange dress but this is a keeper,1
6925,Material is very soft and the cut is flattering i got the yellow and pink yellow is more of a brown color but i still like it,1
6926,So cozy and warm great for the cold nights,1
6927,Was pleasantly surprised at house nice this too was the colors are beautiful the top is flowy and drapes nicely true to size im a and ordered a small,1
6928,I thought this top would be a little more form fitting than it is there is so much extra fabric near the bottom it is almost like a swing style top the fabric will most definitely snag as it is not a linen or cotton top material but rather a silky type and also very thin not very good quality i got the smallest size possible and it was absolutely huge everywhere but the neck,0
6929,These feel so soft and amazing i especially love that the length work for me just a tiny bit long and i am i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans,1
6930,Great colors style and fit,1
6931,This is a beautiful top it fits like a glove very flattering got lots of complimentsi am and lbs i bought size medium love it worth the money,1
6932,I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and its beautiful its delicate and feminine without being too girly or frilly very simplistic and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own my only con is that im a little tall and it doesnt hit me completely on the waist but its still very flattering,1
6933,I love this shirt i actually bought two in black my uniform then decided to order one in white as well however the white shirt fit differently than the two black ones it was significantly shorter over shorter while the black tee is the perfect length the shorter white version wasnt flattering on me and kind of flared out around my waistnot the best look that being said i know the black shirt will be in heavy rotation for a while and the people at retailer were very und,1
6934,This looks just as pictured its comfortable but dressy i love it,1
6935,This dress is very cute and screams summer the stripped skirt adds dimension true maxi length effortless and fun,1
6936,Im and lbs hardly supertiny and the xs was swimming on me the shoulders are oddly large and this beautiful sweaterjacket just hangs off the body believe it when they say oversized styling unfortunately will have to return,0
6937,I have this top with the red stitching and it is one of my most favorite items from retailer ever i wear it with a tank top underneath so i havent noticed any itchiness like the other reviewer mentioned i wear it with slightly cropped slim boyfriend jeans and i get so many compliments every time i wear iti wish i had it in the blue color too,1
6938,I love the embroidery detailing on the top i think this shirt looks better in person than onlineim an hourglass shape and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest but this top drapes down nicely however loose shirts like this arent my style so i belt this at my waist and it looks even better the top flatters my broad shoulders meaning that it doesnt make them look wider and it hits below my hips im i also appreciate that the armholes are small,1
6939,Theres are just what i was looking for these are perfect in texture and thicknessnot too thick but not too thin super soft fleece on the inside i both both the black and greeni will most likely but the grey soon enough,1
6940,I bought the top in an xlarge because i normally wear a and i was swimming in it i unfortunately returned it but did eventually buy the large it is a cute fit and a fun tee to have the fabric is soft but a little excessive on the bottom,1
6941,Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops i could not decide between this and another of theirs but i am glad i chose this one first the design is great very cunning style the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier which gives this top a very finished look the color is a beautiful jewellike raspberry red with a bluish undertone and the fabric is a nice washable poly i wore my usual size xs at retailer,1
6942,So pretty lbs and the xs fits perfectly,1
6943,Love the cut of this tshirt just loose enough but not big and boxy like so many other tees but not fitted either nice weight the hemline is interestingoverall happy with it just hope it doesnt shrink,1
6944,I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy im months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when im actually trying to hide my leftover belly its incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy im medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances a medium would have probably worked normal,1
6945,I had my reservations given that im petite lbs and its midi style im glad that i took a chance i bought the red motif and its beautiful its wrinklefree right out of the package the color is vibrant and the style is classic and effortless fits truetosize great for work with a black tee as shown in the picture,1
6946,I had originally bought this top in one of your stores and loved it got sooo many compliments while reading my email one night i saw it on sale of course i would have bought it anyway now i have of my favorite tops,1
6947,Like the other reviewers this is my new favorite tee its so freaking soft and the ribbon down the back just gives a little added flare puregood has been one of my staple brands for basics for a while and i will definitely be buying more colors in this the length is perfect for leggings and it would be cute with jeans too,1
6948,Love this dress ive already worn it many times i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured the length is great and works with tights or bootsgreat unique dress,1
6949,Love this dress i bought the blue motif which barely has any blue at all it is the softest cotton dress i own i wore it with my red hunter boots today and it made for the best rainy day ensemble love love and i got it on sale which just sweetens the deal,1
6950,I havent owned a skort in years this one is super cute and so soft i love the details the asymmetrical cut and the buckles i bought it in olive green it fits really well im lbs with an athletic frame and i purchased a size my normal size it fits comfortably around my waste and thighsbut with some wiggle room im wearing it today w a navy bluecream floral tank top whitenavy striped vans and a gold dangly necklace i love that its a versatile item and im looking f,1
6951,Super cute lbs and the medium was perfect to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath good quality and lined too perfect for daytime when a leather moto might be a bit much,1
6952,This is a true tiny topgorgeous and runs small i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops but timy i always size up im a c and a large fits perfect the front is a bit sheer but not so much you need a cami,1
6953,Got these in my usual size and they are wonderful the gray goes with everything im hoping they come out with some greens or blues too,1
6954,The cut is perfect and the rose color is so pretty it fits like the typical left of center sizing i wish it came in more colors,1
6955,The fit was not flattering at all but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos,0
6956,Love this vintage high waisted bikini bottom fits true to size it pulls up to a little past my belly button and the runching is in all the right places im not too sure how it will stay put in the waist area for a dip in the ocean cant wait to lounge around in it ar the beach though,1
6957,Wonderful fabric surprisingly great fit super flattering im so glad i bought it despite jumpsuits being a bit of a risk online,1
6958,This is a beautiful shirt the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effectthe only thing that i didnt like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are i was taking this shirt off and one popped off when i went to hang it another one popped off so i had to return it such a shame,0
6959,Love this chemise perfect blend of comfort and sexy i bought it in pink size small im a d about lbs and if fit perfectly i could even probably go to an xs but i didnt want to wait the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant looks exactly like the picture decent price,1
6960,This bathing suit is so cute it fits me great im and about and ordered a medium my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders which could be annoying if you are doing anything active but overall a great modest and cute swimsuit,1
6961,The colors in this dress are beautiful the greenblue version but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy i purchased it online and wasnt expecting it to be so sheer the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown i really wanted to love it but its going back,0
6962,I am and the regular sweater i tried in the store was too long i ordered the petite online and it is perfect its warm and comfortable and can be worn different ways which makes it great for stretching my wardrobe love it,1
6963,Not sure why this tunic dress is rated only stars i love it as i do all coth stone pieces and it is cloth stonw as another reviewer pointed out the material is great and fit is tts except for the sleeves being just a bit tight this dress does not run large as do some cs pieces so dont size down im lbs and slender and the m is perfect if you have large or very muscular arms this dress might not work for you i plan to layer with a thin tee underneath tights and boots,1
6964,This dress is effortlessly chic i wore it with black tights and booties and it was perfection will definitely be a casual staple year around,1
6965,These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits greatthe tie dye is very unique love it,1
6966,I love both the color of this sweater as well as the buttons on the cuffs this sweater is an easy pick any day of the week and goes well with all of my work pants plus the soft and pretty pink adds some brightness to my otherwise dark winter wardrobe,1
6967,These pilcros jeans are so good love the fit the color and the feel i am a curvy girl and these are great they hit me just right now pilcro jeans used to strech out really bad but they seemed to have fixed the problemi wore these jeans at work for hours and they did stretch some but not a dress size so i would buy the size you feel the most comfortable i think these are a no brainer,1
6968,Love this dress great lightweight fabric bold colors and lined to the knee the lining makes sure the dress lies smooth but it breaths well so it doesnt add extra heat i found it ran true to size and its a good length for tall girls i like that you can tie the belt in the front or back looks great on its own or dress it up with a statement necklace there is also a nice girth to the skirt giving it lots of movement great find,1
6969,I was drawn to the greenblue color in store its so cute and comfortable im usually a size and needed the the bodice is flattering and the length was perfect on me im even months pregnant with my nd baby and this will work with my growing belly for another month or so its got great stretch,1
6970,Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed id already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy especially around the collar there is nothing crisp about it ive had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this if i wanted fleece i wouldnt have picked retailer as the s,0
6971,I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person and it is great it is true to size if not slightly loose fitting and a thick cottonymaterial with a pretty design could be nice for spring summer or even fall with a cardigan,1
6972,Love love love this dress have received so many compliments on it im and xs fit perfectly love the cap sleeves and details super comfortable too i can see wearing this yearround and dressing it updown,1
6973,I purchased this dress in yellow in a size and since im between sizes and the fits like a dream i love this dress its a nice length hitting just below my knees and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing highly recommend,1
6974,I tried these on in the store and didnt buy them with the other items in my yes pile i couldnt stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them they are so cute the fabric is a nice weight they have little stretch,1
6975,I love this dress i am wearing it for thanksgiving i bought the black because the red was sold out but would definitely buy more colors true to size im and bought the only issue is i have to wear a slip underneath because its not lined and a tiny bit low cut for me,1
6976,I love this top and the relaxed fit can be dressed up or down i bought the bird print and liked it so much i purchased the umbrella print now im contemplating getting the mixed dot easy to just throw on with anything and the mix of colors keeps it versatile too,1
6977,I love this dress very comfortable fit and lots of compliments for the color moss took me from the classroom to a cocktail party one of my best retailer purchases,1
6978,What a great soft piece for fall the top is flattering and comfy at the same time it looks really romantic with the bare shoulder look,1
6979,Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist within minutes of wearing the waist fell down past my hipsglad i was at home looks cute but will not stay up,0
6980,Love this sweater skirt by tracy reese im a huge fan of tracy reese clothing and this skirt doesnt disappoint super comfortable the colors in the skirt are amazing too many different colors to pull from i can see myself dressing this up or dressing it down with flat boots and a denim jacket i felt it fit tts i usually wear a small in retailer skirts that arent numeric sizes got this one in small,1
6981,I love the cardigan its super comfy and long enough to cover my behind the pink and white stripe lining adds a softer touch its a little tight in the arms im right between a small and medium i wish i would have ordered the medium,1
6982,I love these pants the only thing i would say is that they dont run small i read reviews saying they are small in the waist so i ordered a size up and ended up regretting it other then that i love them,1
6983,This dress intrigued me a bit online but not enough to order it to try it even on the rack i wasnt so sure about it but decided to try it this afternoon i couldnt have been more pleased it is fresh flattering flowy light and beautiful even though there is quite a bit of fabric the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering i didnt realize this came in blue as well i may add that one to my wishlist but the red one is a definite winner it will make a great,1
6984,Nice quality fabric thats soft to the touch lightweight and lays smoothly runs small great for those of us who are small on top the s fits like xs longer length but not tunic length the navy can pass for dark silvergray,1
6985,I got this in the blue and love it tts and the shape is very unique and classy better than shown on the model it can be worn alone or with a long sleeve underneath as a layer considering the neutral as well,1
6986,Great shirt that is basic with a little something extra meadow rue does it againi swear i buy everything they put out,1
6987,I am so happy i decided to try this on in store it is absolutely stunning unfortunately they only had a m and it was a little too flowy so have the s ordered and anxious to try it on the top is really where i am concerned it is too large i am dd and athletic build since you really cannot wear a bra with it which is okay btw the armholes were a little too open and afraid things may show the bottom fit okay a little on the large side but this should fit loose and flowy c,1
6988,This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night i just cannot say enough positive things about it,1
6989,I love the design of this top however its quality is lackluster the shirt is pretty short and would be more flattering at least on me if it had a few more inches also its pretty sheer so figuring out under garments is a dilemma i will still wear it because i love it looks great with a denim vest over it,0
6990,Citizens of humanity jeans are excellent i prefer high rise this brand is my favorite i like the clean lines plain design the material is comfortable substantial with just enough stretch in the material which makes them super comfortable im not constantly pulling these jeans up they hold their shape really well wash well too they run tts,1
6991,Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room the subtle color goes with anything i love it,1
6992,This jacket is stunning the vegan leather has a slight shimmer the waterfall fabric is nice and soft its really beautiful and unique cropped jackets tend to shorten me but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight they were better in the xsp but i wont be wearing any thick sweaters underneath it fit everywhere else im usually an xxsp and sized up for the arms ove,1
6993,Great addition to wardrobe have already worn a lot soft and lightweight,1
6994,This skirt is a keeper great quality beautiful color great fit,1

6996,This dress is gorgeous in person and so comfortable i wore this to a business meeting and got several compliments on it i am feet tall and it does run a little long on me a petite small hits me slightly below the knee however the dress is so nice that i am keeping it,1
6997,Nice jeans fit true to size and look as pictured i recommended those to a friend and she bought and liked them as well,1
6998,Bought the bluegray love the color just the right amount of cling adorable alone or under cardigan super deal on sale,1
6999,Fun pattern great colors and super comfy and versatile great pickup at the sale price,1
7000,This is a great dress for all body types the fabric is substantial and soft i sized down for a closer fit but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit i busted out the boots a little early and the outfit was done super easy to wear dressed up or dressed down totally worth the price im glad i didnt wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out,1
7001,This dress is absolutely beautiful the grey is more vibrant in real life than the picture suggests and the maroon red is perfect for fall and winter seriously this is not your typical sweater dress the sheer sleeves elevate it to a whole other level it comes to just above the knee on my frame it is a bit looser on top im c and more formfitting around the hips but not tight or clingy and so comfortable i am lbs and took my usual small so i think it runs true to size the sl,1
7002,So comfortable fit just right flattering beautiful neutral color but different love the embroidery nothing bad about it that being said i havent worn them the whole day i suspect they will stretch a bit also have not washed them so i hope the color stays the nice rich dark gray turquoise the length is perfect too i ordered the petite and they fit as on the model for a change i have pretty short legs lbs in waist muscular legs,1
7003,The dress i received was not in the least what i was expecting and in the best way possible i initially purchased the dress as something i could wear to work but when i put it on it was clear the dress was meant for something a bit more fun its more along the lines of a sweater dress and is very flattering and chic,1
7004,I bought this top because i loved the floral print i had no idea i was getting a top notch quality top i love the flow of the bottom and the zipper in the back is so classy it has a lining and the coolest thing about it is the snaps that protect your bra from showing love love love this top,1
7005,Every byron lars dress that i have is definitely beyond ordinary and this one is no exception i love the petals that adorn the front my dress was back ordered for a couple of months but it was well worth the wait i wore it recently and received compliments galore if youre undecided about this one go for it its a winner,1
7006,This is my first ever review these pants are star fantastic ordering additional colors because i love these so much and am finding i want to wear them every day i initially ordered the bronze color which is superb just beautiful i was worried it might be too bright to wear to work or be a different hue in real life but they look just like the picture to my happy surprise they dress up easily its a really rich color that i have been able to pull off at work with long sweaters and boot,1
7007,Im very picky about jumpers and this one is abolutely perfect i love how it looks like a dress at first glance it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have i sized down because of the armpit area nude garments and youll be fine this is going to sell out fast dont wait for it to go on sale seriously my store is already out of xss,1
7008,Wonderful fabric drapes nicely from waist flattering use for air travel as not too heavy in weght beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors nice addition to tight patterned pants boots dress up or casual,1
7009,The quality and fabric are fabulous but its just too voluminous for my figure lbs would look great on someone more slender,0
7010,I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress i purchased in both a sp and a mp i am the mp fit perfectly i definitely wouldnt keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together its not super soft coarse on the inside and feels old the back is longer than the front it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps even with leggings and great boots it looks worn,0
7011,Love this comfy breezy dress so easy cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out i gave stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets which ill fix next time the sewing basket is out i think the double layers of gauzelike material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals so be a careful around claws paws the back side is straight which isnt as interesting as the front but for my use the dress is darling,1
7012,I love the way this dress fits and flares in all the right places making it one of the most flattering dresses ive tried in a while for me maeve dresses tend to run a bit big so i sized down to a small im typically an the colors are a little deeperricher in person which made me very happy i love the flounce in the skirt it adds more swing to the dress the only draw back was the vneck came down a bit low easy fix with a cami for work,1
7013,I read all the reviews and was hoping that this top would work for me but it did not i ordered a size smaller than usual and it was still way too big it was not flattering at all on my curvy frame overall it looked more like a maternity top on me then anything else if youre tall and slender i think this top would work,0
7014,Quite possibly one of the most flattering beautiful and effortlessly romantic dresses i have ever tried on and to top it off it has a sweet surprise the silk slip on the inside of the dress has the same print as the outside shell and it is so lovely that if you feel like wearing something short and sweet you can wear the slip as its own dressruns true to size to maybe just a little bit bigif you have a smaller bustline and narrow hips you might be able to size downits cr,1
7015,I loved this dress from the moment i saw it i ordered it immediately after reading the reviews and felt confident in my dress size choicebut when it arrived it was big i am lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a or in dresses so usually a small but sometimes a mediumbecause if this in between that i am i ordered a smalland it was really too big so sadincalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywherestyle is fun and flir,1
7016,I love hess overalls they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way i am lbs and a b i bought the xs and it fit great they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls you can easily dress them up or down soft and stretchy material is a plus,1
7017,I do not know where to beginthis sweater exceeds my expectation i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopperas beautiful as that one isthis one made my mouth fall open it is unlike anything i have it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything order your regular size as it is suppose to be big,1
7018,I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring summer the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tuckedin the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color,1
7019,I absolutely love these pants i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric well these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy i love,1
7020,This light blouse is beautiful and true to size i ordered the black one and love iti would recommend this product,1
7021,If you are like i am and love coats that stand outthis is for you there are many s first being the quality embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right colors are wonderful and fit is tts it alsolooks great belted and much nicer in person,1
7022,Like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short im only xs and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model also the quality isnt great as its very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front its a shame bc the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique sadly its going back,0
7023,I was using my daughters dress and ended up buying myself one as well it is a versatile casual dress very flattering and my daughter and i have different builds i actually wish that they sold this in more colors,1
7024,These leggings are loose fitting and the quality is just not there i am returning the item,0
7025,This is one of those i need one in every color kind of shirts need not simply want it is very well constructed the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online but it works ive only had the shirt a couple of day in addition to wanting to wear it every day the fabric has not pilled im shortwaisted and i have not had any issue with the highlow hem or cropped length,1
7026,I am five foot tall about lb and got the petite zero it fits perfectly and i love the flower pattern great for weddings parties or work,1
7027,This is perfect if you are looking for comfort and style in the same bathing suit,1
7028,Ive been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it im so glad i did the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight the cut covers a regular bra pretty well a big plus and makes my arms look good i cant wait to wear this it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days,1
7029,I cannot say enough good things about this dress as a petite person it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations but this dress fit perfectly its also so wellmade the fabric is soft comfortable and gorgeously detailed and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume in a good flattering way i got it shortened by about but this dress fits like a dream,1
7030,Love everything about these pants a little sheer but super beautiful and comfortable,1
7031,I must admit that i was a little hesitant to try this top on largely due to my shapefyi broad shouldersback c short waist typical size dress or buttondown shirt knit or not fitted top mi purchased the heart design in a size m since the upper part of the shirt is oversized a little bit not too big and baggy though and then narrowis to the waist think upsidedown triangle as the shape of the top since this is also my shape on top on bottom i worried that th,1
7032,So pretty and flattering its my new favorite blouse its also really comfortable i do not tuck this one in i love the knit material makes it extra comfy and breathable the colors are very pretty and wearable the quality and cratsmanship are impressive it has a straight bottom hem and slight boxy cut which i like i am and weight lbs i ordered the small but i was going go a slightly bigger comfy fit i couldnt be happier with this purchase,1
7033,This is so thin and poor quality especially for the price it felt like a thin pajama top the buttons are terrible little shell buttons this could not have been returned faster,0
7034,Oh my god i love this skirt i first order the size and immediately called customer service and had them send me a i found it be be both plenty stretchy great for moving sitting etc but runs on the large size but the fit is amazing i love the length a perfect kneeskimmer for me i love the color green and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much ive tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can,1

7037,This is perfect it fits tts i am usually an and this was spot on it isnt too short either it really is as it appears on the model i absolutely love it and cant wait to wear it my hubby definitely approved,1
7038,This is a beautiful top but the xs was literally inches too wide very disappointing i am thin and tall but this was a maternity top on me i dont usually wear xxs it is much more voluminous than it appears in the picture and it is definitely gray and blue not white,0
7039,These are fab as always with pure good printed leggings bright beautiful print great quality fabric and flattering goes with lots of color tops too took my usual size s in bottoms and found them perfect,1
7040,I have a long torso and wider backthick middle in proportion to my narrow tights i was worried after reading other reviewers comments for reference im a in pants in jeans xs in retailer tops but for floreat and maeve im always a i ordered a size and it was perfect with my long torso i expected this dress to fit weird but it was perfection in love i wore it with faryl robin lace up sandals,1
7041,The cut of the top portion of the dress is off i tried on the s instore it bunched up in the breast area i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem nope still bunched up for reference i am a b i would have kept the dress and given stars if it wasnt for said flaw,0
7042,I have broader shoulders and thick arms this dress does an amazing job slimming my arms and not making me appear top heavyim lbs the xs fit perfectly,1
7043,I was surprised at how soft this is it also has snaps under each arm for definition and on front for closure didnt know that and love it got yesterday in mail wore out last night highly recommend,1
7044,Love this top i receive so many compliments wearing it even from my teenage boys runs large but thats the style of it very flowy very flattering,1
7045,Great fabric and design beautiful pattern with flattering angled bottom hem and fringe so soft and comfortable the hood is cuter left down perfect transitional piece for fall i got the neutral color and it is so easy to wear im and got the sxs size and feel that it is still wearable i second the opinion one reviewer mentioned about wearing a belt through the slit over the front part definitely works well and makes for an effortlessly stylish look,1
7046,These are very flattering thick leggings that would keep you warm in the fall and winter but when i pulled them up i got a big hole in the seam at the waistband at my first trip to the bathroom obviously you might expect a rip if they were too tight but these fit perfectly even on the looser side and ripped effortlessly pretty embarrassing given the price bringing these back for reference if you decide to try your luck i am and my normal size s was perfect,0
7047,Love the pleating on this top looks great with mywhite jeans its lightweight and has a slight sheerness,1
7048,Sleeves were tight was difficult to put on for the price you want to love the shirt sending it back,0
7049,I love this it is comfortable flowing and reminds me of glamorous women in s movies i especially love that is completely looks like a shirt its pants because i dont have to worry about my skirt flying up as i race around the city bra no bra doesnt matter which i love as someone with a larger bottom then top and am pretty tall i usually have trouble finding one piece items that arent too short in the crotchwaist zone very roomy without looking like a sack,1
7050,I ordered the black white petite im lbs and i order petite sizes all the time the length for the size i ordered is about on the back from neckline which is great for me however the length on the sides is way too short the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans not at all the way it shows on the model i would order regular length but then the sleeves will b,0
7051,Great coastal sweater color in my opinion is a perfect rendition of coral the sleeves hit just right for me to wear long or bunch them up i can see this sweater paired with shorts or skinny jeans,1
7052,I bought this in a medium at the store usually a size and bought one for my daughter who was with me in the coral color shes months pregnant and bought her a small it fits fine below the belly she loves how comfy it is my other daughter saw them and i had to buy her a pair as well so we were hanging out at the hotel on a girls weekend and wore them at the pool and even to sleep in i think you can actually dress it up and wear it out and about as well i did see that a,1
7053,I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small i found it very short and wide that being said it is meant to be cropped i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly albeit a little short for reference i am usually a size medium in retailer shirts and dresses,1
7054,Love this blouse the top is true to sizeim generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great the pm was just a bit snuglooked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me im for reference and curvier on top than on bottom i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate i cant wait to wear it down to dinner for,1
7055,What a great jacket love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture very happy with my purchase,1
7056,I am very pleased with this skirt you can tell it is very well made and is just beautiful very true to size,1
7057,Love this fun print one of the most complimented items in my closet i ordered petite after trying on the regular regular was a bit too long for the look in the models photo i am size usually the blue has faded a little bit the pants have maintained their fun and funky vibe,1
7058,I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute having worn it almost every day this summer it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings seaside strolls chilly restaurants or for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside,1
7059,Cant go wrong with these new charlies by cartonnier they fit amazingly the fabric is a textured cotton but doesnt seem to wrinkle just shook them out of the bag yesterday the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give just a little but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour paired it with all sorts of different tops side zip is slimming lined pockets substantial fabric nothing bad to say if you havent tried a pair of charlies you should you,1
7060,I purchased the washedout blue color it is lovely with blue or black jeans medium fit great it is heavier cotton and ever so slightly stretchy this is not the kind of cotton to eventually come out of the dryer with tiny holes around the bottom of the tee it is very comfortable the embellishment on the sleeves is a nice touch and i like the yoke with loop closure on the back a fun addition to my casual wardrobe,1
7061,I loved this skirt they didnt have my size anymore so i tried on a few others i really needed a small p otherwise i totally would have kept it,1
7062,I wanted to wait until i could give this dress a thorough wearing before i reviewed it it exceeded my expectations i wore it at an outdoor wedding the red and received so many compliments on it it is wellconstructed and the cutouts are gorgeous no danger so far of them ripping or tearing the zipper in the back is a little bulky for the dress but not a major deterrentim and about lbs and the size my usual retailer size was perfect,1
7063,I bought this dress for a holiday party and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo i still liked it but when i went to try it on it was just not working i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted i would recommend sizing up but be aware that the top straps shoulder to breast are too loose to begin with so they may sagoverall i wouldnt recommend this dress for the curren,0
7064,This shirt is so soft and buttery it fits tts and just as shown on the model for the sale price this shirt is a gonga good goto shirt on those days where youre just not sure what to wear one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose so you can see your bra i think if you wear a black bra with it though it would be fine,1
7065,I saw this dress and i thought it would be perfect for that night that you dont feel like wearing just jeans yet you dont want to be overdressed the dress is cotton and is extremely comfortable i paired with an open toe wide heeled bootie and a long necklace the dress has a slight a line bottom but fits close to the body in chest and arms extremely flattering for all body types and the color is a pretty blue a dress for all seasons,1
7066,I got the jacket in the gray its a pretty pretty shade of gray its soft and feels really good on its short like hits at the waist i have long arms and the small for perfect which i was very pleased,1
7067,In true cloth stone fashion this product is incredibly soft and comfortable i bought mine in petite small but it will flatter a number of different body shapes and sizes its easy to launder machine wash and it will work as a perfect piece to dress up or down depending on how you accessorize the product i cant wait to wear this while im on the go and traveling over the summer,1
7068,It definitely smells like vinegar but it went away after a few hours i dont think its itchy its kind of baggy and kind of has an ombr look to it fading down to darker it looks casual in the pic but i can wear it out at night with cute earrings,1
7069,I love this very comfortable cute dress true to size picture cant wait to wear it,1
7070,This coat is so gorgeous its true to size fits perfectly warm and flattering,1
7071,Goes with absolutely everything its very comfortable and versatile can be dressed up or dressed down great thing to have in the closet when you dont know what to wear,1
7072,I love this so so much im with a short torso and post baby d boobs the petite is perfect its the first romper i found that fits me in the crotch height and leg area so excited to wear this,1
7073,I bought this sweater for my future daughterinlaw for her birthday in coral she lover it the contrast of color in the yarn is hard to see in the photos grey and bright coral just beautiful,1
7074,Adorable old school retailer the only gripe i have is trying to get this on the slip is similar to putting on a straight jacket once you figure it out then its gorgeous just be careful and lay it out carefully before you pull it over your head,1
7075,Love this piece can be worn casual or fancy runs slightly big but that seems to be the style size down if you are in between sizes the color is unique and organic really comfortable and fun fabric,1
7076,This is a beautiful kimono but just isnt made well the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling it is going back for good such a shame,0
7077,Usually retailers designs run small for me but this large fits great super comfortable long enough to wear with leggings love the back cutout design and fabric choice depending on bust size it may seem to sit funny but its not meant to be a true baby doll design that sits under the bust mine looks great,1
7078,I love this sweater its vivid soft and high quality its a little shorter than id normally go for but it will look great with a mid to high rise jean it runs true to size and meant to be roomy the red is very vibrant,1
7079,Adore the bright embroidery against the black background mine was well done and no loose threads although this is all synthetic fabric which i hate paying for but i couldnt help myself once i tried it on its very roomy and if youre slender size down unless you prefer the breezy swingy look like i do this is a three season dress that will do well with layers and without i picked regular hem instead of petite and it actually looks slimmer on me than the shorter version,1
7080,I bought a suit similar to this last year and loved it this year i bought the pineapple print and it is beautiful size it is classysexy i have a long torso so i like that it covers me better than most one piece swim suits i try on i highly recommend this product,1
7081,This is a subtle classy shirt im lbs and an xs fit perfectly shirts like these that dont fit snugly on my back cover my poor posture genetic and make me look like i am standing up straight nice,1
7082,The fabric was nothing special i usually like a cottonsilk blend woven fabric but this was stiff feeling and the pattern was cute but what made me return it was the fact that the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint literally puffy paint and the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it i could barely unfold itim sure this could have been cute but who wants a top that looks lik,0
7083,This is a cute dress the quality is very good for a dress of this type the fabric is not too thin and the stitching is perfect i do think it runs a little small i typically wear an xxsp or a p and i purchased this in the regular xs regular xs is typically way too big but i took a chance on this one because i really liked it and i also like my dresses a little bit longer than shown on the models surprisingly it fit well in the chest and the armholes were not too big as is often the case,1
7084,This arrived this week and i was so disappointed the proportions are all wrong from the empire waist to the dolman sleeves to the weird texture added to the material if i could sum up this jacket with one word it would be weird,0
7085,Im baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are i ordered the petite small and im always a small these are huge i felt like i had on a large i like the thin material and color and im sad that they are so large,0
7086,I am so happy i ordered this jumpsuit it is exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit the fabric is light and its very well made great length for dressing up with heals or dressing down with flats i love it,1
7087,Yay hei hei love these pants thanks to the rollup they show a nice bit of ankle lightweight but sturdyive been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans theyre a little poufy toward the top below the waist but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer i did experience some stretchingsagging after a full day of walking moving and sitting so i bought my second pair in m instead of l got navy and went back,1
7088,The quality of the fabric and the design are perfect i love the cut out and how flattering on my shorter figure i am somewhere between a and and the fit perfectly it can also be strapless which is a sexier version,1
7089,Im returning this cardigan it doesnt fit me at all its shapeless and loose,0
7090,This is a very well made top i like the cut and it fits true to size very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique im happy with this purchase,1
7091,I had a dress that felt like this in it jiggles even if you dont no amount of spanx can cure a dress jiggling of its own accord the neckline that i had thought would be classic instead veered into frumpy all in all i felt like it belonged in a discount store surrounded by polyester brethren,0
7092,These are a great versatile pair of black pants they look chic without trying too hard and they work well dressed up or down they do run a bit big as others have said i generally wear a and thats what i got in these but theyre definitely big and bag out by the end of the day,1
7093,Ugh the fit of this dress is terrible what a beautiful dress though the material and the colors had so much potential but the fit is awful i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok if not a tad big but hip down was crazy tight that i couldnt even zip it without a ton of effort i dont think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger disappointing,0
7094,Colors are much more vibrant in person love this skirt true to size makes a statement and is still classy,1
7095,Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and im obsessed like previous reviews mentioned it runs a little small in the chest im normally a medium but am a c so ordered the large and it fits perfect with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what its a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well,1
7096,I would never have noticed this from the product shot it was on the one of a kind rack at my store the open work that shows off your bralette or a cami is sexy and it has just the right amount of slouch super comfy i loved it bought a medium,1
7097,I cant say enough good things about this sweater i bought it when it was fullprice and it was totally worth it it is incredibly soft and looks very sophisticated i wish i could live in this sweatergiven the color and my propensity to make a mess i want to buy two more just in case,1
7098,Just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer i am and lbs i took a small which is my usual size at retailer could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer but that doesnt bother me another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us i will wear this all summer long looks great with denim happy find,1
7099,I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs i am ft and weigh lbs and i wear a size in jeans i bought a size in these and they fit great i wouldnt size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine,1
7100,I bought this dress for summer celebrations the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down very feminine and has a romantic feel,1
7101,Love the sweater the knit has a rich look and the fit is perfect i paired it with a printed pencil skirt for an eclectic look strongly recommend to your wardrobe,1
7102,This tee fits true to size not oversized the material is super soft and the colors are delicate the armholes dont show your bra which is hard to find nothing bad to say about this top except that my size was sold out in every color but lavender which was lovely,1
7103,On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but dont think will look that great on me this dress was that item today not only did i like it but i liked the way it looked on me im pounds and purchased the medium i loved it the clerks loved it and my very honest daughter also loved it i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans,1
7104,This top is beautiful it drapes just like the picture with gorgeous details in the back this is what i expect from retailer i am and b and took my size small so i would say tts i tried it on with a strapless nude colored bra and it was not visible give it a try you wont regret it,1
7105,Im going to be straight out this dress is very flattering and will get you a lot of male attention so be warnedi am a c and i got a size p it fits tight but just right i have no trouble with the buttons at all i am and it comes above my knee the material is very quality and seems as it will last a very long time i get complimented very often when i wear it,1
7106,The ivory color needs a little camisole or tank underneath the sweater is beautifully knit and has a soft and nubby texture hope it washes well maybe size up if you want a looser relaxed feel hits me right around the hip bone and i am can easily be dressed up or down with accessories,1
7107,This is the perfect loungesleep cami i am lbs and purchased the dark purple small its hangs a bit loose my preferred fit for sleeping shirts good quality easy washing machinedelicate and cool and airy for hot summer nights,1
7108,I love this tshirt its a little bit dressy because of the lace but the tshirt material is great for casual wear i tried on the white but ended up buying the black because the white is so sheer ill still have to wear a layering tank with it but the black just feels less sheer for some reason really cute and nice quality tshirt,1
7109,Soft sleeve is cuffed different called moonscape cool vibe tiny threads on front of moon,1
7110,This is so soft and really cute would be a good bathing suit cover must wear a cami under it,1
7111,I am fortunate to work in an environment where i can wear jeans just about every day so i am always looking for a good pair to add to my collection i bought this style on a relatively quick shopping trip with not a lot of thought well weeks later i was back buying a second pairthe color is great a little darker with that warn in look but no whiskering with a fit that is tts i like the higher waist to cover my mommytummy and my butt looks pretty fabulous but the best thing about th,1
7112,Ive been looking for a wrap cardigan for a while and this totally fit the bill it fits well is soft and made of good materials i love the versatility of using it with all my dresses this is a great staple piece,1
7113,I bought this skirt in my usual xxs petite and the waist was way too small i could not even pull the skirt all the way up returned,0
7114,Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap just love,1
7115,I saw this in the store today tried on a small and a medium and a medium fit me better which is unusual usually i am a small this top is fitted around the chest and flowing at the bottom a little longer than usual but the pattern is so pretty that i got it i am pounds and got a medium,1
7116,I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model,1
7117,The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes to my surprisethe tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest areathe appliqueslaces on the front are made of low quality materials,0
7118,These are such fun pants its a heavier denim without being so stiff they run tts i got my usual size they fit comfortably i havent washed them yet but once i do i typically wash in cold gentle cycle hang dry,1
7119,I was hesitant to buy this but im so glad i did this is a beautiful poncho i am petite and usually ponchos overwhelm me but this fits just right it is extremely soft not itchy at all the color along the bottom of the poncho is actually a bright pink color it looks a little more red in the photo to me im still happy with this it will be a wonderful addition to my fallwinter wardrobe great product,1
7120,Although i love retailer this product isnt the quality or presentation i expect from them the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess the fabric wasnt soft and fluid as i expected but rather was stiff and a little scratchy i purchased the ecru version which was also slightly darker than the photo showed i returned the dress and will keep looking,0
7121,I love the design and the fabric but the fit is just off on this dress the area around the bust is just not fitted well the wrap portion of the dress in this area gaps and does not lie flat that is an easy enough fix with a good seamstress but the waist also sat too high on me maybe im long waisted who knows so between the super high waist and the flanneltype fabric it just looked kind of like a bath robe on me i wish it werent so i was so hoping for a cool plaid dress that i cou,0
7122,I definitely recommend this shirt its lights and airy something you can wear everyday,1
7123,I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions it wasnt as elegant as the model pic is it ever and for this price should fit like a glove went back within seconds also its pretty short and bulky short isnt flattering on too many people,0
7124,I started stalking this dress when i saw it on a stores instagram feed and i was so thrilled to get it in the mail however i ordered it before reviews started popping up and i was concerned it would not fit in the bust however when it arrived the fit is perfect its not exactly loose in the bust but there also isnt any pilling the highwaisted nature was also suited to my shape im usually between a and a and the was great in this dress and a perfectly joyful lengthappropr,1
7125,This skirt fits me like a glove you must get the matching top and orange jacket that makes the whole outfit highfashion fun chic i am and full figured and imlove this out fit very cozy too,1
7126,Let me just say the ski pattern is the cutest thing ive ever seen i literally bought it as soon as a saw it i got a size im usually a or in most blouses and shirts but i wanted this to be a litter looser so i sized up its definitely not oversized even though i sized up the fit is a little boxy and a little shorter in the front really flattering in my opinion the material is really nice and it can definitely be dressed up for work or dressed down with jeans and a chunky scarf,1
7127,Crazy soft and comfy light weight so will be great for spring summer and layering so happy i bought it,1
7128,This dress is so fun and very comfy the slip it comes with pulls the whole dress together it has been great for warm fall days but i can see it being warn with leggings and boots into the winter i love the combination of blocked deep colors along side of pastels im and the length is just right not too short,1
7129,I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the and the im between the two sizes typically in case it ran small technically it does the is tighter but it looks better sitting higher on my waist the is looser but doesnt look as good likely sticking with the the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality it can be dressed up or down,1
7130,I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top the lace cant be too fragile the top cant be too see through it cant bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it cant be dry clean only the stars have aligned on this one i bought my usual size and it fits tts i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami it certainly seems worth it for full price,1
7131,Yes it is big but it is also amazing so soft the colors are great and the hood well the hood makes it great colors for fall its a poncho its not supposed to be fitted ill be wearing this all fall through winter love it,1
7132,I am short and have a short torso so the empire waist line was really flattering i got the petite size small and it fell just above my knee loose skirt portion led to an easy look to the dress overall super cute,1
7133,I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer it was stunning the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate i regretted not purchasing it immediately fast forward to today the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores the fabric was different there was hardly any beading and the colors were washed out and dull i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo but t,0
7134,This top is beautiful and fits true to size ft inches and lbs and i purchased the xs i was at the montclair location today and they had this top in white lavendar the pattern which is displayed online and gray the white was see through so you will definitely have to wear an under garment with it this top will be perfect for the spring with a cardigan or by itself in the summer i still have a little stomach left over from my second pregnancy and this top hides it well i decided to,1
7135,New fav lbd i am months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again it fits right above the waist with a bow to cinch the waist love the fit and flare the top is warm great for a cold evening out and the taffeta really dresses it up love,1
7136,I thought id be the first to review for non size small ladies im usually between a large and xl in retailer the large was great with room as this top is pictured youll love the details on this colorful fun top ex buttons on the side great with skinnies i bought it on sale but it really is a special top and worth the price,1
7137,I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up the pjs are charming and comfortable the material feels very satiny its hard to tell but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background true to size,1
7138,These pants are so comfortable and cute you can dress them up or down,1
7139,Second to shopping for a swimsuit i hate shopping for jeans so difficult to find a pair that are both comfortable and stylish the good news is that this pair is both the length hits slightly below my ankle which is the perfect length for me im they are a slim fit with a slight bit of stretch i ordered the size which is my normal size and they fit perfectly love the wash for a casual look wish they also came in a darker wash for a dressier look all in all i am quite pleased w,1
7140,I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think itd be great with some leggings and boots as well if you want a more structured look go a size smaller i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large the coral is beautiful,1
7141,This tunic looks great in person whether you get the red green or navy runs true and hangs wellthe ruffle at the bottom is super flattering and the construction of this tunic is impressive so good i had to get both the red and navy,1
7142,This is my new favorite sweater it is a great midweight sweater that hangs beautifully with an interesting bottom hemline im so happy with this purchase im and the m is perfect,1
7143,This robe is exactly what i was looking for its perfect for lounging around while getting ready and also good for postshower while im still drying off it is a little shorter than it looks on the model but thats fine for me only downside is that it has to be hand washed,1
7144,I am so sad i have to return these leggings theyre adorableso much so that my fianc commented favorably on thembut as other reviewers have pointed out theres no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or theyll fall down why sleeping on snow whyyyyyyyyyyy theyre so great otherwise,0
7145,Yes this is a bit expensive however it is made in the usa so that is a very good thing i appreciate having the opportunity to buy high quality welldesigned basic pieces that are simultaneously supporting my community and country when you are considering this pretty top please click on the gold so that you can see the detail it is very wellmade and flattering i love how it has a slight shape at the back very flattering and feminine the feel and weight of the cotton is remarkably com,1
7146,I had such high hopes for this shirt i got it in both the black and moss which is a beautiful color however the ruffle was just too big i put it on and immediately felt like a circus clown it would probably be beautiful on a woman with a more straight figure with fewer curves but on me it was not flattering at all,0
7147,Was excited to wear the dress for the first time but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel strangest thing just a random hole appeared,0
7148,Although this is an online only i was lucky enough to stumble along a return in the store this is the same quality and soft fabric that i expect from tyhlo it doesnt show as much in the model photos but this top has a subtle highlow effect which adds a bit of elegance to the topi took my usual size xs in the tyhlo brand however note that i am small busted bc and this was already starting to pull some across the chest my biggest critique it that this pulling caused a small ga,1
7149,This goes well for cool weather great with jeans or other casual pants i got the green its more of a teal color but pretty runs large i usually run between small and medium i got the small and its a tad too loose on me,1
7150,Legs are too wide the fabric is rough to the touch,0
7151,I know youve heard it before but this dress is so much more beautiful in person im petite usually size but busty so i tried the and the in the store the fit perfectly except it was a bit snug at the bust so the the slit pulled open revealing a bit more cleavage than i wanted the fit perfectly through the bust and although it was a bit loose through the body the cut was still very flattering i also tried the p which fit but i preferred the longer length of the regular,1
7152,I loved the look of this dress online so i went to retailer to try it on in the dressing room area we were all laughing because i tried on a small when i got it tied to the point where it looked like the model online i couldnt raise my arms the distance between the cuff and the waist is inches even if you manage to lift your arms the whole dress will go with it and expose you as much as if you werent wearing a dress at all but a shirt too bad poor design for sure and such a shame when th,0
7153,Ive been looking for a staple longsleeve tee for a while now and i think ive found it i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect the material is soft the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places the sleeves are long enough which can sometimes be a problem for me the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long ill be back for more colors,1
7154,Cute and comfy looks like i will be able to dress up a bit too fabric and fit are great,1
7155,These are the best tights last year i bought these and they went back to regular waistband this year the best waistband tights are best,1
7156,This dress is huge i am normally a lxl regular in retailer brands i love a loose flowy dress after trying one on in the store just a random returned petite xl i ordered the petite medium and it was still huge and not flattering so sad i wanted to love this loved the material and colors but way off,0
7157,Softest cardigan ive had in a long time fits a little bit on the large side especially in the sleeve length but who doesnt love a big cozy sweater this is a great way to add some color to any fall outfit highly recommend this one all i wish is that it came in more colors,1
7158,This pretty tee looks wonderful on the cut and drape really flatter a womans shape and will be versatile for pairing with casual or work outfits i love the soft feeling although it is not cotton as posted online the tag inside the shirt says rayon spandex it doesnt really matter but its not what i expected the rayonspandex is very soft to the touch has a beautiful texture to it and certainly feels comfortable i really love the lower back hem at the hips so flattering i d,1
7159,Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit the fabric is soft it flows perfectly and isnt too long it covers my rear no gapping at the chest and im large busted i got a large the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back looks great under a jean jacket,1
7160,This dress is more beautiful in person than it is online during the fallwinter i love to wear dresses with tights and pair them with boots this dress is so cute the material is pretty thin but lined and flowey i am b bra inch waist and a size was great the dress itself is pretty shapeless but string around the waist is adjustable to make it fit you the right way giving it some shape the v neckline is definitely more attractive in person than in the pictures and the stitchin,1
7161,I purchased this in the creambeige color and love that it will go with everything i can add details with long necklace or scarfeven a belt but it also stands alone and looks great with leggings or skinny jeans i would also wear with a neutral skirt as shown on model the fabric is not too thin and with a bit of cashmere will also add some warmth it may shed some depending if you wear a nylon cami underneath i purchased the xs my usual size and fits great slender love my purchase,1
7162,Nice fit and color and i love the tall cuff but you will need to size up at least two sizes as the previous reviewer stated these jeans do run extremely small i usually wear a ag in jeans sometimes a for the ag legging jeans but the in these were still very tight all over and uncomfortable i dont like my jeans skin tight so i had to go up to a size but they fit and look great sizing definitely off on these i am for reference,1
7163,Bought this shirt in red in my usual size small it is so comfortable and easy to wear i am tall and it fall on me similar to the model in the picture not sure if i can wear with leggingsmay be too short in front im looking forward to layering it under sweaters and sweater vests for a pop of color,1
7164,I dont think its possible to say enough good things about this dress the fit is beautiful im lbs and am a h the material is soft and swishes around your legs in a delightful way and the length has all the positives of a maxi dress without dragging on the ground it doesnt show bra straps it looks good with either heels or a trusty pair of birkenstocks the pattern is fun essentially its the perfect summer dress,1
7165,I really wanted to love this dress it is absolutely beautiful the color design and details however whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy though i am slender i have a chest maybe that was the problem,0
7166,So disappointed beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange loose and baggy through the top and midsection but tight around the buttock and thighs,0
7167,I love that retailerpolgie has petite sizes now i am and lbs i bought the p and it fits perfectly the dress is very cute and the colors are a way to transition into fall when its still warm out,1
7168,Wanted a jumpsuit that didnt look stupid on a year old this is it ordered a large and it is a little loose around the waist but still fits and is comfortable extremely well made and very cute the only complaint is that it is difficult to tie the back,1
7169,I saw this very shirt online thought it was so pretty in person the shirt seems flimsy the buttons look as though theyd fall off i also didnt like the cut of the shirt it seemed to be tighter on top looser on the bottom had to return i couldnt justify the cost with the quality,0
7170,Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful i couldnt get it off fast enough picture this tight in the best tight in the hips extra billowy in the middle so confused and cant see how this would be flattering on anyone unless youre planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric skip,0
7171,Either this rouching is going to accentuate your waist or its going to accentuate the fact that you just had a baby and ate too much linguini unfortunately i have more pounds to go and sadly this dress pointed that outthat said i had to give it five stars all around because its good quality design etc itll be great but not for me got a medium and it fit nicely with the exception of pointing out that i still have baby belly to lose d pounds hope this was hel,1
7172,I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blueish category i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfullyi especially love the design of the trench with the wider pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyones figure this is a fantastic unique design for,1
7173,I bought this mainly because i have a similar one in the mustard colorway and i love how this flows the color is definitely one you dont see a lot of which is what makes it special i could see it running a tad large but i think its pretty true to size now im debating about buying it in blush,1
7174,The fabric and cut of the dress is beautiful i am writing a review so i can share my experience regarding size i ordered the dress in size my normal size for this designer it fit ok but was a little large in the bust area for reference i am a a i i returned it and ordered a size which fits perfectly,1

7176,Ive been looking for a black sweater just like this with this comfortable material weave,1
7177,Beautiful top and beautiful bright color this does run sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested i am usually a size and a c and broad shoulders and size just its in underarm area i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short if you get the right size this topics really adorable my husband also gave it a big thumbs up,1
7178,These are nice jeans for the price they are tight at first but do stretch out so i am glad i went with my normal denim size and didnt size up i wish they didnt have a button fly but it didnt bother me enough to return them,1
7179,The ruffle is a sweet detail on what might be an otherwise basic rather boxy shirt it is a nice weight and drape but please know it is a bit short and square i love the asymmetrical ruffle however and think it makes this tee worth it,1

7181,Comfortablet eh fabric is very soft the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic lace up neck on trend too i ordered the xxs p as it is likely loose that was just fine for me xs p would have been not as flattering theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug workout arms not too snug that i cant wear the dress but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer and have to pick in my wish lis,1
7182,I loved the shirt the fabric was amazing and i loved the way it fit unfortunately it didnt look good on me but i would recommend this shirt to anyone who can pull it off the look i was sad i couldnt,1

7185,I wanted this so badly to wear as a dress over a slip but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on it made me look pounds heavier than i am and the fit was awful i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big so disappointed because its so pretty,0

7187,I bought the orange version during the tag sale and was so pleasantly surprised when it arrived it fits very well and is made from thick high quality material i only wish they had more colors sizingi bought the p and it fits well although a p may have fit better the dress is fairly low cut on me although i am small chested but i wouldnt feel comfortable wearing it to work,1
7188,I love this just bought it and so glad i did really want to wear it out so hopefully the weather will cool down soon since i am in the south and we are experiencing an extremely warm winter regardless it will be with me a long timeso if i dont use it this season i will eventually as it is timeless and goes with anything,1
7189,I purchased this jacket in my local store size and runs really small i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling looks like it is worn in an bad way returned the next day this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad,0
7190,Love this skort bought it in green in store and am now going to get it in black on line fairly true to size maybe on the lightly larger side soft well made and comfortable bought size am lbs,1
7191,Seriously most comfortable pants ever fabric feels very luxe are they dressy enough for the office i dont care they feel that great,1
7192,This dress stunning for the hourglass figure the hips may be a little narrow i bought the p and p and the p fit best i read some reviews that said the hips were snug its true a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering shoulders are a little loose and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest im dd waist and lbs,1
7193,I really like this top the material is thicker than i thought which is a good thing it fits me very well and is very comfortable i definitely recommend this shirt,1
7194,The chevron pattern on the mintseaside version needs to be centered in the front to look right mine was totally off so i returned it and had them overnight me a new one to my vacation address unfortunately the nd suit i received was also off center that one is going back too would have loved this otherwise a quality check on this is definitely needed beware,0
7195,I ordered my usual size m and when arrived i thought the material and cut was nice once i tried it on it was way too big in hips i looked rather comical how it extended on the sides i returned the dress,0
7196,I purchased this poncho online in the cream color when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color as well thank goodness it didnt come in more colors this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed plus it is very soft you take one look at it and you know the quality i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way i do agree it is not quite as long as pictured but pe,1
7197,I love this poncho it is flattering who would have thought i would use that word in the same sentence as a poncho and offers enough room for warm clothes underneathit is stiffer and thicker than i had originally anticipated and the material is somewhat itchy so i would recommend long sleeves and clothes with more covering underneath,1
7198,This coat is spectacular it was love at first sight but it was only after trying it on in a store that i decided i really wanted it even at the full price the design is unique and gorgeous you dont see coats like this on the street not a cookiecutter its very soft yet warm and has a gorgeous ochre colored lining making it very easy to put on and a standout when a bit of the lining is revealedit seems the fit is what most reviewers complain about and i can see that i tried size,1
7199,This dress not only makes a statement it is very comfortable and versatile casual or dressy options price is reasonable and i am anxious to wear it for the first time true to size and has some give i ordered xs love it,1
7200,I love panties i love the prettiest softest most adoreworthy panties i can find these are my favorite boy shortsi can always put them on and feel pretty no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch im a mom and my body isnt perfect anymore but these panties give me confidence with perfect coverage i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer my only warning wash these pretties as delicates or the lovely lace colors will fade,1
7201,I just picked this up today in the store and i have to say i really love it on the site i thought it was just meh but in person the space dye is interesting and the seam detail make the sweater better than i expected it definitely runs large i sized down to an xs usually a s size and its still slouchy and comfortable without looking sloppy the dolman sleeve gives you plenty of room in the chest and the neck isnt at all tight its soft and just an overall cute sweater,1
7202,Great easy to wear addition to the wardrobe i wore it all day today and no pilling plus the pockets are really convenientthey are a good depth for car keys or a small wallet im pretty busty ddd and have a curvy bodywith that said the small fit well i prefer wearing it with the zippers opened because my behind and hips look odd with the sweater fully zippedfor ref inch hips give this one a shotits a nice surprise,1
7203,Great fabric great fit great shirt just found my new favorite for this summer,1
7204,This is huge i thought it would be oversize but with a bit of shape there is no shape to this and is a lot of material i ordered an xs and typically wear an xs or s in blouses sometimes medium in sweatersit seamed like sizes too big the material is very soft and the collar is nice there is a ribbon tie at the waist the tie is wimpy and could be nicer when tied there is so much fabric the is gathers and looks like i have no waist,0
7205,This is probably the softest most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully great for spring summer love it as a coverall at the beach my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me highly recommend,1
7206,I love this skirt i know others have thought it frumpy maybe its because im so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me not too long not too short but just right the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding still im glad i ordered it before it was gone,1
7207,I love this top i found it to be true to size i usually wear a size large or extra large and the size large fit well i really appreciate that the armholes are not gigantic and dont show underthings i bought the navyblack and find that a navy cami works well under it i like this with casual pants and jeans under an open front sweater for now and think it will be nice with a linen skirt or shorts in warmer weather this is not a style i would usually wear but i found the two tone lace very,1
7208,Adorable peplum top colors are much more rich in person saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale beautiful material and craftsmanship i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase highly recommendgreat piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall,1
7209,The dress didnt look like much on the hanger but the rust color caught my attention so i tried the dress fits beautifully i did have to size down to a small because the medium was too large on my frame i have a longer torso and the elastic waist did not quite fall on my natural waist but corrected by pairing with an obi belt which looks fantastic the bottom is lined and flows rather nicely the dress has a modified hilow thing going where the front and back are longer than the sides but,1
7210,This is perfection in the color sky get you one now you will not regret it it is super soft and flattering,1
7211,I bought this as a reward i have wanted a leather jacket forever and i truly love this goes with so many things tons of compliments soft comfortable material,1
7212,This is the cutest poncho style sweater but the arms arent attached like a true poncho it doesnt work for a petite customer unfortunately but on average sized its gorgeous so pretty,1
7213,Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store i usually wear an or a depending on how things run im a dd so i tried on both sizes i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get the was just a tad looser so i went with that one but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference it is a very figure flattering top and a plus that you can machine wash it simply awesome,1
7214,Great skirt fits as expected very cute can be dressed up or down i love the pockets,1
7215,This dress is gorgeous i bought it to wear to the ballet and i know i will wear it to other formal events as well it is really fancydefinitely wouldnt wear it to work i had it hemmed as it was really long on me and it is a bit tight in the shoulders it has a beautiful shape and flows while you are walkingit felt pretty,1
7216,Gorgeous but so big i got eh pxs and its like a mumu i wiill return,0
7217,When i put this skirt on my aunt said that looks like a skirt with class shes right this skirt feels as wonderful on as it looks i love the faux leather slash it is the perfect detail without detracting from a printed top i think it is great to just slip on no zipper for those daysi even pulled this on over a dress bailey hits it out of the park again i have dresses and now a skirt te colors on the website are brighter than they are in person just fyi,1
7218,This sweater was huge it hung down to my calves it also is really bulky and scratchy it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people im and weigh lbs and i ordered a size s and i was swimming in it the fabric is very thick i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic it adds about lbs to your body frame,0
7219,I love this top soooooo much i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness i love that this top has it allit is lightweight and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top it is comfortable even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms i love that the colors are not bold i am sick of neon,1
7220,I bought the black leggings and love how warm and comfy they are i wore them with a tunic and boots to work and people were surprised that they were leggings the ribbing makes them nicer than plain black leggings i want another pair especially for the price,1
7221,How i did not notice this dress for weeks i do not know this is absolutely the best casual dress ive ever had the pleasure of owning and i hope my future includes acquiring the other sold out colors i was fortunate enough to buy the holly in m and taupe in mp and they both fit well and look flattering on my unproportioned body this dress goes well with many layers or on its own and is going to work for at least three seasons in my area the drape of the willa complements my over large upper,1
7222,The fit the length the color the fabric cannot say anything negative at all the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in and she could not wait to see how they looked on they were just as awed as i was the pants can easily be dressed up or down the brown color is so so beautiful i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come,1
7223,Let me just say that this material is awesome when i first took it out of the packaging i was afraid that the top was too thick of a material but after wearing it around the house it seems light enough i live in a warm area i will say that i find the top to be a bit larger i ordered a medium in fear that the small would be too small on the bottom i could have taken the small in the topeven though it is meant to be baggy the bottoms on the medium fit me great they shorts dont b,1
7224,These jeans are excellent ive been looking for a boyfriend jean that has plenty of room without just looking too big and these are it theres lots of give in the material but they still conform to your shape i highly recommend,1
7225,I love the fabric and details of this dress i was thrilled to see it in person i plan on wearing it when the weather gets colder because of the styling of the dress i am choosing to keep the hem where it is and thus prefer it as a colder months dress the poppy flowers really pop in this dress love,1
7226,The material is great got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one everyone compliments them,1
7227,I wore this jumpsuit to a newport wedding and got so many compliments im lbs and the petite was perfect with heels,1
7228,I recommend this dress for women wth a small bust this is an absolutely gorgeous dress but it runs very small through the bodice and is almost empire waisted if you remember the coral dress from spring by the same designer it fits the same but this one has a tiered skirt so sad i love this dressthe colors and design are beautiful,1
7229,I love how boho colorful and comfy this dress is sometimes you just want to wear your comfiest bra and not worry about a dress that doesnt cover the straps they were out of the petite small so i went with the small i am lbs and it fits perfectly just more of a midi length no problemo,1
7230,I am and run between a size pant i ordered the size skirt and the waist fit perfectly and so did the back of the skirt which i was afraid might be loose i dont really have a butt but it fits nicely looks like the picture so the skirt goes straight down it does not taper to smaller width like some regular pencil skirts might so the bottom part will not be fitted for your reference the denim actually has quite a lot of stretch so its very comfortable as well as the waistband,1
7231,After seeing this dress online i wanted to try it on and was not disappointed when i did even though the coral color dress of the same style was pretty it wasnt the right color for me i absolutely love the blue and white dress i usually wear a size but found the was more flattering im and the length was perfect above the knee but not too high love it,1
7232,I saw this a few months back and wanted it then and now i bought it i missed a few promos but i ended up getting it at full price in a large my usual size i like in the pilcro denim jacket line i love pilcro and have several of this brands denim jackets and each one is very special i love the use of the plaid details it has a weathered appearance the denim and my distressed treatments are not too severe as some reviewers have commented on the holes i will say this jacket runs small,1
7233,It stays on i mean off the shoulders the price is shocking love the low price but by no means id cheap really love this little beauty,1
7234,I ordered a med petite usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down as a regular shirt it was not cute,0
7235,I love this top the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy the cut is fitted and flattering the color of the fabric is ivory not bright white the embroidery is a good quality and doesnt easily fray the fit is true to size i highly recommend this top i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute always get compliments its very comfortable too,1
7236,I bought a p when i shouldve bought a p i was swimming in the p however it didnt matter because everything was itchy and im not even allergic to wool the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design and just like other reviewers commented you have to twist and contort them to get them to buttonwhich inevitably will lead to them popping off and i didnt see an extra one in case that happened the coat is stunning theres no argument about that and i welcome,1
7237,I love this jumper it is absolutely gorgeous and also quite possibly the most comfortable piece of clothing ive ever owned,1
7238,The product looked more or less as expected but the fabric felt very cheap not the quality i would expect from retailer the shirt is also very short which did not bother me but is something others should be aware of,0
7239,I was so excited to receive this in the mail it fits true to size and is extremely flattering so glad that i made this purchase,1
7240,Omg wish it came in more colors,1
7241,This is the dress that i have been waiting for all season perfect color the material is also firm without being heavy or thick if you know what i mean it lays flat and smooths out any bumps without being overly stiff the vneck is also not too deep and the sleeves are not too short overall a complete win now go and make it in gray and navy blue please,1
7242,This dress looks great online with boots as shown when it arrived and i tried it on it fit great on my arms wasnt too tight on my neck but once it went down over my chest c the dress never came back in to show my feminine waistshape it just looked like a big trash bag on me very disappointing similar to a mumu,0
7243,I was drawn to this top because of the interesting and detailed straps which are embroidered with a lovely triangle pattern however the embroidery takes away any stretchyness or give in the cotton and makes the top a beautiful but illfitting harness for anyone with any breasts or fullfigured lusciousness the worst part is that the top hem along the top is embroidered and rigid just like the straps so it feels like you are wearing an uncomfortable strapless top i wanted to keep this but h,0
7244,I bought this dress last week for a wedding next summer it did not appeal to me on the hanger but once i tried it on i was so impressed the green color is lovely and it is lightweight and airy and it does have a lining which is a plus i love the little ruffle sleeves and the tie in the back is perfect there have been comments about the hemline being awkward but the length on me was perfect and has just the right amount of flounce to be feminine i cant wait to wear this dress i am,1
7245,Super soft and comfy with stylish look,1
7246,Saw this online and went in to try on fit great and is true to size but i should have known there would be issues as three out of six on the rack had the sewn in tags were all but hanging by a thread i bought this for my bachelorette weekend in napa and when i put this on i noticed the straps had a few threads coming out and i thought better get this to the seamstress as soon as i get home to secure the straps well literally five minutes into the car ride to the wineries i noticed the seam,0
7247,I actually rather like this top i ordered a size smaller than usual based on how flowy it looks in the picture and was quite pleased the pink color is rich and i love the cut work it has a bit of a sparkle in it and is very pretty and flattering on the back it does swing out a lot but i ended up half tucking it the pink color is very nice it is gauze material so of course it is thin i usually buy but this was great also there was no petite in the pink so cant comment on,1
7248,I am a huge fan of cloth and stone tops as they are very versatilethis particular one didnt disappoint the combination of plaid and tie dye is so fun and fresh yet the blue makes this piece an easy one to match with many bottomsnow for the fitthe cotton is very soft and lightweighti bought my normal size medium and it fits perfectlyi look forward to wearing this piece often,1
7249,After reading the reviews i sized down to a once i received it i loved the fabric and color however it was so illfitting its like the designer didnt even use female measurements and used a box to make this toptoo wide i liked it so much that i sized way down to a and it still fit horribly it is too wide and not long enough both are going back,0
7250,This jacket feels like a throw blanket but has shape and is appropriate to wear both casually or dressed up to make it profession enough to wear to the office the jacket is bias cut and longer in the back to cover your rear since its fleece the sleeves roll up easily and you can move around in it with ease it has pockets big enough to carry your phone im with a small chest and i got the jacket in my normal size small and its loose enough for me to wear layers underneath if i w,1
7251,Love this top very flattering and form figure i dont see the issue with the buttoms has elastized back enough to pullover in and out material is thin yes but not so see through im so keeping this,1
7252,I purchased this blouse for an easter brunch and couldnt be happier the feminineromantic print is a gorgeous addition to my spring wardrobe ive paired it with a pencil skirt and heels for a dressier look as well as my favorite ag cuffed denim and sandals for a more casual daytime look,1
7253,I am broad shoulderscan sometimes wear a size depending on the cut i purchased the size and was a true fit just enough flow to give you room to move but not too much to make you look larger than you really are the fabric us light and great quality perfect for a summer night out so happy with this purchase,1
7254,This top will be great in seasons i can wear it alone in summer to dress up and with a blazer or sweater in fall and winter the velvet is beautiful and luxurious without being excessive or too much its very soft and comfortable on the skin although a little larger than i expected i ordered my usual size small and probably should have gone down a size,1
7255,I never owned an older version so nothing to compare to i found it comfortable stylish and warm on a cool fall day the minor piling made it look more rustic has not shed on any of my other clothes so far,1
7256,I tried on the regular size at my store wish stores close to me carried petites and it was jsut too overwhelming aka big i wanted to purcahse the petite however as i really like it striked out as they are sold out in my size bummerthe cut is otherwise flattering and the sweater is really comfortable i like all the contrasting colors and patterns too,1
7257,I am a m and got the it fits perfectly and there is room in the bust im c the shirt feels very nice and silky up to the skin im just not sure about the print i got the umbrellas its cute but maybe a little too cartoonish it does look good with a green or blue puffy vest for colder daysstill trying to decide if i should keep or return but only bc of the print id love this in some solid colors,1
7258,I love these jeans at first i was unsure of what shoes to wear with the length of the crop i dont wear block high heels as pictured everyday chasing after my boys but once i figured out which shoes looked cute i was in heaven the fit is very flattering and it will be a great jean for everyday fun,1
7259,I have athletic calves from running so i really struggle with straightskinny jeans but these fit me just fine and dont look like jeggings i think the slit helps i have a inseam and these hit just above the ankle great find especially on sale,1
7260,I just bought these jeans today i absolutely love themi usually wear a or in any jean depending on the fit i bought these in the regular they fit so perfect they definitely are not a legging fit nor are they a baggy boyfriend style on the tag these jeans are described as a girl fit slim with a dash of ease that describes the fit of these perfectly they are not tight not baggy at all just a bit of ease at least on me i am the regular length is perfect the fab,1
7261,As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter in terms of fit i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics at with a very small,1
7262,This is the most perfect dress ive ever bought im and the length was perfect the cut is flattering and very slimming the fabric is gorgeous and the pattern is stunning please offer more dresses in this cut,1
7263,I saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind when i saw it on sale i grabbed it the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect not too short the small amount of spandex is so comfortable it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well i am i can wear a med or large i bought the large it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves not a typical denim jacket looks great over a,1
7264,Everything about this blouse is perfect the color the drape the detail so flattering and easy to wear i just love it,1
7265,I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater the sweater looks like its falling apart and it is huge i would not recommend this even at a clearance price,0
7266,Im and lbs and i was swimming in the small the arms are very boxy the sleeves too long and and it just wasnt a flattering fit at all the color and design on the front are both nice the sweater is made in china and very very itchy i own wool sweaters and wear them with layers but there was no way this was going to be comfortable very disappointed especially given the price but perhaps thats why there are so many left at the end of the season and on sale this one is going bac,0
7267,Oh this is so much prettier in person what you cant see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit it is quite charming fits true to size,1
7268,Beautifully constructed and designed this lovely sweater coat from rosie neira makes me anticipate fall weather more than i should the fit is perfect for light layering and has a feminine silhouette the wool feels like all my other boiled wool piecesits soft slightly itchy but tolerable i wear a layer anyway so i hardly notice just be aware for those that are extra sensitive i purchased size mp and my stats are,1
7269,These pants are as dreamy as linen but much more forgiving when worn all day they fit true to size and are very flattering i have pair they are my go to work pant that can be dressed up with an elegant tank if i have to run to dinner after worklove them,1
7270,I love the shirt and it runs true to size everywhere but the arm holes i bought a size small and the length was great the fit was great but the arm holes were gappy and big i had to return it and was bummed because i loved it otherwise,0
7271,This top is the perfect combo of function and flair the style of the top makes it easy to wear and the back detail is just lovely i love that it can be worn as either a buttonedup top or a light overshirt with a tshirt or camisole underneath i would pair this with blue or gray skinny jeans,1
7272,I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it online and ordered it in my usual size petite im d and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on i immediately adored all the different prints on this one the length the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter its a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well also,1
7273,I found this in the returned section of the store in a large i am normally a m but the fit would have been too small in the shoulders it is very light weight and the color is much lighter in person which means it will go right into spring,1
7274,Love it material is soft and color goes will with any color,1
7275,Id been eyeing this dress since i first saw it in the dress catalog when it came out when i saw it in person it was just as beautiful as i remembered im about lbs and usually wear a size s or m but i tried the s on and decided to size down to an xs because the linen flowy fabric lays a bit wide when on the body however the s would have worked too id say size down if you prefer your clothes a tiny bit more fitted the fabric is beautiful and lightweight even though there is more,1
7276,This is the perfect throw on little blazerlike jacket that feels like a sweatshirt i loved it so much on sale that i bought another one in a different color i am and lbs and the xs fits like a glove it is so great well made so comfortable versatile dress it up for work or down with a pair of jeans,1
7277,Wish they had more colors avail in my size when i bought this one you can easily dress it up or down,1
7278,I wanted to love this sweatshirt but alas it is going back upon opening and unfolding the first thing i noticed the dots and not solid they are sort of distressed looking with parts of them missing secondly it doesnt have a lot of structure its soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way its just not flattering on me it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house for reference i ordered the and im usually a in tops,0
7279,Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on so lovely i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person its like a muted blue that makes it so versatile the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering the safety pin is such a unique touch its nice and warm just not super soft but not scratchy i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily,1
7280,Got this days ago and have worn it of those days it is a perfect beautiful autumn dress the fabric is textured and slightly colorvaried in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth the fabric is a thin sweater knit because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does nor would it be as figureflattering despite its thinness it is still warm would buy this in oth,1
7281,I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago poor quality in cut fabric design this is a top one would grab at a local box store for the colors are not as vibrant the shoulders ill fitted and the fabric and threads are very cheap i was expecting so much moresorry retailermy favorite store to shop,0
7282,I pair this jacket with a black pencil skirt and it looks very put together the embroidery is lovely and well done but the jacket would have been nicer with a polyester lining because it clings a little when you put it on and its an awfully heavy jacket for the summer but overall i love it and how i look in it i think it runs true to size,1
7283,This top runs larger so size down i love it besides that its adorable,1
7284,These pants are my new go to i am and the fits perfectly they do give a little lots of colors to choose from i have the washed blue and am thinking i need to get more colors,1
7285,I was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark it isnt fitted but it doesnt look sloppy either though it is comfy and is called a sweatshirt the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt,1
7286,Its a great light jacket for early spring ideal topper for jeans or denim skirt,1
7287,I just got this in the mail had to immediately write a review i love it i took a risk ordered the xxs which i assume is a it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large im a true dress size but usually wear a or xs in us sizing the shoulder length from seam to seam is about inches im c hope this helps,1
7288,Beautiful dress the color in person in a rich golden sun not too flashy a very warm hue it will compliment every skin tone it is more fitted than most peasant dresses not as much flowing material very flattering the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout very well made with a nice cotton lining i am usually a size six in a dress and the small fit beautifully even with my large top it is a stunner that can be worn with boots or sandals you will receive a lot of compliments,1
7289,Perhaps it is the s vibe that hit me but i had to check this out with the free shipping week i am so glad that i didi fear wool as i have sensitive skin but this is soft and snuggly the structure will allow for fit over many different types of underlayers but unlike so much offered lately it is not huge or tentlike but a perfect fit it is a heavier weight light coat weight this is perfect for me in the south the color is as pictured golden in my xxs petite the sleeves are p,1
7290,This dress fitted me like a glove i ordered the size at ft and lbs it was perfect though i could not weigh two pounds more i cannot wait to wear it it has that wow thing going for it very good quality too,1
7291,I loved this dress when i saw it online i could not wait until i see in one of the local stores i bought it today unlike other reviews i think this dress runs large i am a and bought the zero maeve tends to run large on me i would suggest that you try a size smaller it looks very flattering,1
7292,I love this top was not immediately in love with it when i saw it on line but when i saw it in store the other day and got to try it on i fell in love the colors at a little deeper in person which i loved it is a traditional soft flannel top it is fitted and flattering a must have for fallwinter,1
7293,Picked this up yesterday in the muted teal great shape great color the pink one is way brighter in person and the green i think is more of a forest green each one was a little different super cute good price,1
7294,I like the design of the dress but the fabric makes it look cheap for an expensive dress i had expected better quality,0
7295,On the reali needed a sweater they gave my tummy some room what yes id love some more pumpkin pie know what im saying what appeared to be lack of constriction in the belly region of a tiny model made me hope with fingers crossed it would look like that on me please please just swing and not cling mmmmmk the majority of the fabric content is natural and a sale was going on so i went for it and purchased this sweater online so glad i did,1
7296,I absolutely love cozy sweaters and this is my new fave i love that it ties and it feels elegant so much fun with jeans and one of my fun tees underneath or with a skirt boots and hat love it i wear it as im sipping my tea in front of my fire place writing my book yes im writing a book its a cozy writing a book sweaterthat is it its perfect for that on my white sheep skin cozy rug and my animal print chairs im in heaven sipping my coffee in my cozy room with my cozy sweater,1
7297,Great sweater heavy without being too warm great layering piece,1
7298,These jeans are the best fit perfectly so soft comfortable and look great on i am in love i put them on and did not want to take them off i am and simply love the length for me plus in my opinion the high waist is a s dream so comfortable and really flatter my curves these are pricey which is my only real complaint but they are feeling worth it as i see myself wearing these a ton and the quality seems great so i am thinking they will last a long time dont hesitate to buy these,1
7299,Ive been looking for exactly this i really love it it is heavy but made extremely well and on sale a great price,1
7300,This is not a kimono its a cocoon theres a huge differenceits also not made very well,0
7301,I love love love this swimsuit yes its a bit pricey for a bathing suit but i love the design and colors and the back detailing is sexy yet not all that revealing i cant wait to wear it in hawaii next month the only part to be careful about is not to stretch it too much when putting it on and taking it off i can see the diamond cutouts stretching or even ripping if pulled too hard by accident overall a great swimsuit for the summer,1
7302,These pants are so perfect i bought pairs perfect for casual fridays a night out or the weekend,1
7303,This will be a cardigan i will wear across all seasons if you want to layer a button down or another long sleeve shirt under it i would suggest sizing up one size as soon as i put this on it felt like it molded to me its beautiful and comfortable,1
7304,I am sooooooo massively disappointed in this purchase i thought i had found the perfect pant in this style both more comfortable and more flattering than similar styles in the store i wanted to wear them every day received lots of compliments felt that you could dress up or down etc this is where i have to admit that i wore them several times straight from the store before washing on the second wear i noticed threads coming out on the seams but just on one side of one leg this was irr,0
7305,This caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better for me i am and about lbs the xs fit better i usually do take an xs in tops i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice the material was nice and flowy i did not feel the neckline was too low,1
7306,I wanted to love this dress however it has no shape to it it is also somewhat see through so something needs to be worn under it i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned im extremely disappointed i do not recommend,0
7307,This sweater looks just as pictured on the model its very warm though even with cropped sleeves i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems outer grey material isnt very pleasant itchy however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch,1
7308,This sweater is way cuter in person the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater also it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front really cute and soft not itchy highly recommend,1
7309,Short of calling it dark gray which isnt dark but thats fine because i saw the picture its everything i wanted it to be i just wish it was chiller here in georgia so i can wear it more often,1
7310,I said this ran large because i bought a and i normally need a size im busty if the item doesnt stretch but a size fit me its more straight and less blousy but it does fit so if you like your tops a little less full of fabric and more tailored but loose imho you can size downthe fabric is rayonpolyester thats light and cool it is semisheer but a white bra or nude bra would be fine the top has a double layer in front one solid and the overlay of the embroidery th,1
7311,Cant say how much i love this top ordered on a whim and when it arrived i was so pleasantly surprised the sweatshirt fabric is thick the under layers are high quality sheers super easy to dress up or down i wore it to a casual company holiday party and got tons of compliments bonus that i just had a baby and the top seemed to hide my notquiteprepregnancy body but will also look great when i am back in shape a definite keeper,1
7312,So glad i purchased this tunic just lovely can see myself reaching for it constantly this summer necklace friendly too,1
7313,I bought this kimono only a couple weeks agoand i think ive worn it six times already this kimono is stunning light airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous the print is unique and bold ive worn this over a black dresswith leggings and a white tankwith denim and every color top the options are endless with this beauty the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s,1
7314,I usually pick the large size when it comes to fitted jackets but in this case i decided to go with size medium i have a broad back and round shoulders and large upper arms when i put the size large on the body of the jacket looked too boxy on me the medium is much more flattering but i cannot put a thick layer on underneath when the weather gets cooler i am pairing this with my herbalist dress and my other sleeveless garments i am d,1
7315,I bought these pants in red after trying them on in store they are soft and company they have a loose fit which is typical for chinos so they pair best with a fitted top im and these were the perfect length when rolled they run a bit big and stretch out though and eventually were too baggy i loved them though so i ordered them in a size down id definitely buy them in other colors too if they become available in my size,1
7316,I ordered this shirt online and didnt even try it on it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i dont want to have that extra layer in the summerit is cute though,0
7317,I purchased the purple motif in petite size small it hits just the right length for me but i can see that if i were any larger chested it might be an issue for reference im a d lb its very forgiving on the tummy area without looking bulky other moms know what im talking about and understand my appreciation for this the shirt is also a nice quality really comfortable and its easy to wear with jeans shorts skirts etc making it a welcome versatile piece,1
7318,I received this blouse for christmas and it is just gorgeous it fit true to size and goes with my whole romantic feminine style that i have without being overly girly not too sheer so no need for a tank underneath and being that it is neutral it will go with just about everything i own love it,1
7319,This sweater was just what i was looking for it is so soft comfortable the design is unique and delicate yet doesnt shed or itch the decorations are not as pure white as pictured there are several different tones of ivories creams i ordered the xs which is my typical size in retailer sweaters as i find that most run very large and this is no exception it is oversize but not bulky however the decorations do add some volume so maybe not for all body types,1
7320,I am ft and lbs and i tried on the regular and the fit better but there was too much extra material in the back so i order the petite the petite fit perfectly very classic in the front with the right amount of flow in the back i cant wait to wear this to work or out to dinner with the girls,1
7321,I couldnt wait to try this on this sweater sadly it was too large in all ways the sleeves are adorable but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms this was much longer on me than the model it stopped midthigh the quality seemed fine but it is a thin sweater,0
7322,I am very disappointed with this order the shirt looks and feels cheap is not flattering in any way i am sending it back right away,0
7323,I like this so much that i ordered it in both colors it is soft can be worn both ways and i like the crisscross detail very comfortable not formfitting i usually order a medium or a large and in this one sized down to a small,1
7324,I actually paid full price for this over the winter and im not sorry i did great top wlovely fabric i usually wear a small but in this top an xs so it runs a bit large,1
7325,This is a great sweaterponcho is a little short so i wear a t shirt underneath great color and looks good with black pants or skinny jeans,1
7326,I am pounds and ordered the petite it fits perfectly and is very flattering the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome it gives the dress some character i am also a fan of the rollup sleeves i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one the one and only potentially negative aspect and i say potential because im not sure if its an issue or not as i havent wornwashed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron,1
7327,This is a casual flattering off the shoulder float dress with pockets perfect for sunday brunch or a casual night out and as other reviews stated the fabric is lightweight but you cannot see anything through it except perhaps a glance of the outline of your legs but that is it definitely not a reason to not buy this adorable dress,1
7328,I ordered flora nikrooz for my daughter for her wedding it is beautiful the delivery was quick very happy,1
7329,This tank is well made and the top part is doubled partially so you can get away without wearing a bra if you wish im and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured the pintucked area fit well not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i dont mind i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me i opted for the white vs the black because i love the pi,1
7330,I want to like this top because the idea is cute but i ordered the small and it might have well been xxxl with sizing like this one size fits all could just about do it,0
7331,I just got this dress and i love it it is classic and beautiful the zipper is tricky right at the band but otherwise no issue there i cannot wait to wear it,1
7332,This is such a comfy dress and recommend it to anyone pairs amazing with leather boots and hat,1
7333,These are perfect for pulling off a finished look proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands the polyester material is substantial lined and easy care the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted i plan on wearing these a lot this year,1
7334,Im i tried both the regular and petite the difference was quite substantial sometimes if an item runs shorter or smaller i can get away with regular sizing the regular was all wrong and the petite was perfect in every way the regular was wrong the petite sizing was perfect for top coverage tamed the flare to just the right amount and the length hit right at the perfect spot where it is supposed to above the knee gorgeous embroidered detailing and versa,1
7335,I usually wear stevies in ag but when i saw the prima was on sale i decided to give it a try and im so glad i did they came today and i tried them on i will say the rise feels a little higher than midrise but its so soft and stretchy i didnt really care theyre definitely skinny but with so much stretch they feel like a comfortable legging that doesnt fit quite so tightly the colorwash is great too for this price these are awesome i ordered a same as my stevies and it fit per,1
7336,Beautiful timeless dress runs small straight fit cant wait to wear it to work or a function,1
7337,Tried and pictured the regular size small my stats are a and i usually wear a or an on top in shirts and blazers the small here was nicely loose so it might run a bit bigin person the colors are dark navy on light beigelovely heavy weight cotton and stitchingi think its deliberately a bit short hit at my hip im but i like thisthe sleeves are a bit nowhere for mei wish they were full length but thats my only quibble,1
7338,Love the color very soft unique look cant wait to wear it this fall,1
7339,It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned did not fit well and was not good quality very thin,0
7340,This looked like such a cute casual skirt when i picked it up but like other reviewers have said it runs small im usually a xs in retailer skirts but they only had a small to try on i was able to get it on but did notice it was snug pulling on past my hips however once on i couldnt figure out how id wear this i wouldnt pair this with a flowy top but tucking something in didnt seem like a good idea either between the pleats and elastic waist it will make almost anyone look like they ha,0
7341,Runs a tad big but not enough to say it runs large if that makes sense but just beautiful,1
7342,Tshirt is beautiful looks like watercolor the fabric is a thin soft cotton that is really nice i am and very thin xs fit well and was not too short s would have been fine too i would choose a size by your shoulder width i bought my mother the medium,1
7343,This was such a great top see thoughts belowpros fits tts for reference im c hourglass im normally a m or l or depending on the fit and found the medium to fit well and not be too tight at all i could have probably sized down for a snugger fit but i like the looseness fit very well across the chest and arms the sleeves are surprisingly flattering ive dealt with other tops where the sleeves flutter too much and adds too much weight and attentio,1
7344,Love this top dramatic in a casual wayi ordered the teal and love love love itwith skinny jeans or leggings the style is perfect i am over so the teal is gorgeous and i think very age appropriatei ordered the blue also a very pretty shade of bluebut felt in this style the brightlight colors would be more appropriate for someone youngerits a stunning topand fits very true to sizethe drama of the ruffle is what sets it aparthoping they do,1
7345,Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now and this one is more than i had hoped for in the store i was between a l and m so went with the large after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large jacket is roomy warm and so so soft added bonus w the hood,1
7346,I bought this in green and i absolutely love it the quality of material is very fantastic a durable fabric that will hold up well over time its a good quality too so can be dressed up somewhat and also does well as a very casual piece love it,1
7347,I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt slip floral pattern pleats i literally feel like a princess greek muse in this dress cant recommend it enough true to size im and lb and got a size,1
7348,This top is soft comfortable and drapes nicely the print makes it fresh and different i sized down to a small,1
7349,Love this top the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee it makes it easy to dress up or down the length is great not super long but not too short i ordered a medium and it fits well not tight and isnt baggy the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesnt feel stretched over my belly or anything nice silky weight,1
7350,I purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing i like the lining it adds a substantial look to the dress,1
7351,This skirt is so flattering and comfortable,1
7352,This dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos its incredibly flattering and i like how it pans out at the bottom it also has pockets although it has a builtin slip it is a little seethrough so keep that in mind otherwise i cant wear it enough,1
7353,These are great casual comfy pants for summer im lbs usually a or in pants the reg was a better fit than the p,1
7354,Unusual color expensive even on sale,1
7355,Love this vest just got it in the mail last week and i have already worn it twice with two different looks its timeless and can be worn in so many fun ways,1
7356,These are super comfortable i love feeling like im wearing pajamas in public but being properly dressed although i wear them around the house often too i dont regret spending this much money on these pants it was worth it since im wearing them so much,1
7357,I have this top in both the green and blue and live them both the back of this top is so cute and makes the whole topthe embroidery is cute too,1
7358,This top has really beautiful lace detail the color is much deeper pink than the picture online i ordered the xs petite and it fits fine but i like my tops longer so i wish i had gotten the regular xs instead it is very pretty,1
7359,I purchased an xl and am tall the pants fall near the ankle just like the pic i plan to wash on my gentle washing machine cycle the texture fabric print will pair well with any printed tops you choose these lounge pants are great for everyday wear especially for errands in town so much better a choice than yoga pants which to me look ridiculous when wore in public so ladies please leave your yoga pants for the gym and treat yourself to these casual comfortable pants i have two pairs,1
7360,Three strikes and retailer is out for me i am so disappointed i really liked this dress and was looking for a fun distinctive new shift dress got it tried it on took it off went back to look at the listing onlinenowhere does it mention that it has a dropseam in the shoulders i guess you can see it if you zoom in closely on the image but its not mentioned in the text who on gods green earth actually looks good with a dropshoulder it hits every woman under right in the middl,0
7361,I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did mine does not have any weird smell at all i ordered a medium and i wear a size it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings with coverage the detailing on the yoke is so pretty i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe,1
7362,This jacket is beautiful and easily dresses an outfit up and can just as easily be dressed down and worn casually i consistently wear a size m and have this piece in xs the reviews do not lie size down,1
7363,Every springsummer i look forward to tlas tanks tees and stock up on them sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online but this top i bought it in green is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee just keeps getting softer wash after wash and the silver buttons on the side what a unique twist to an everyday tee now all i need is the blue one,1
7364,Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go these are a cheap impersonator the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half the last pairs of pilcro stets ive ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally the pockets on these jeans sit so so low completely unflattering the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially the old stet ankle jeans ha,0
7365,This shirt is very comfortable to wear mostly because the buttons are well placed many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot,1
7366,I bought this dress to wear at a wedding i am short so i would have really loved the petite but they were sold out both online and in store when i bought it im making do with high heels the sheen is gorgeous and the dress is very comfortable over all id also add that im pretty curvy and the cut fits my body perfectly,1
7367,When i ordered this online i should have paid more attention to the picture the dress comes to the knees of the model i was swimming in small petite size i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size nope it was ps either the dress was mislabeled or this is cut huge returning too bad because the shape and color are cute,0
7368,I originally ordered this in green and unlike another reviewer i thought the color was perfect for spring it is trendy flattering and fun in green but perhaps not a color i would wear longterm so i decided to return it and order it in red and black i also noted the boxy cut and if that is what you want it runs true to size however if like me you want something a little more form fitting consider ordering down a size or two depending on your chest size and just carefully shimmy,1
7369,Absolutely in love with this dress perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout im a b waist and hip and and went with the xsp very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price,1
7370,Ordered this in the neutral motif size large and its a great little dress comfortable and cute but modest enough that im not worried about my bust d hanging out too much the vneck hits at the perfect spot the sleeves are the perfect length not too tight and its not too short on me im a light blonde and i dont feel washed out in this it hides a little belly well without being a tent also the lining is super soft and flexible the only problem is the upper back falls,1
7371,My only wish is that the front waistband were more highwaisted but other than that the pants are darlingflattering vintage yet ontrend and made with high quality fabric and tailoring i am pounds and i bought a size they are a perfect fit,1
7372,This dress just fits weird maybe it works for somebody there is a reason it has been put on sale,0
7373,What a shame this dress is i wear xl and am but the dress in the store in the size xs looked just the right size yup xs was just the right size i cant imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering it would look like a sack it is an inch or two too short in the front for me so ill be returning it,0
7374,I was a huge fan of these lovely swing dresses from last year and bought all colors when i saw this new one i was thrilled and ordered it immediately what a disappointment why did isabella sinclair mess with a good thing the fabric is a very loose weave sort of homespun look which wouldnt be a deal breaker but i could see it would be very vulnerable to snags last years styles had a removable light knit full slip that allowed the airy fabrics to move this version is fully lined yo,0
7375,I ordered this in a petite online and i usually wear petites it isnt see thru in a way that shows a lot and i love the light weight fabric i get a lot of compliments on it,1
7376,I really love the pattern and the look on the model and i thought i would love it i ordered online so i did not try on in store when i tried it on it has way too much fabric around the waist and skirt it is thick fabric as well and has a lining and the waist has extra fabric for the design and it has pockets so it all adds up to be way too bulky it is not flattering at all and made me look pounds heavier i am returning this dress sad because it looks so lovely on the model i am,0
7377,Ive always loved the idea of jumpsuits but could never find one that worked either the print was too crazy or the length was too long or the waist line looked funky on me this one worked perfectly im and the regular xs fit nicely cant wait to wear this especially in the springsummer,1
7378,Beautifully made shirt however the sizing is way off the sleeves and across the chest are really tight while the rest of the shirt fits fine if you get a size larger then the shirt in the body is to large would recommend if you have really tiny shoulders arms and chest such a shame since i really love the shirt,0
7379,I purchased this sweater in the grey and loved itmuch prettier in person the photos do not show the delicate details which are lovelyi found that it fits true to size and has a very flattering fitit is also a very versatile piece depending on what you pair it withi love it so much that i purchased the peach and wine colors as welli found all colors beautiful and each gives this sweater a different lookthe grey is sophisticated and works well with almost anythingthe peach is del,1
7380,For those of you that dont care for stretch jeans you would probably like these they feel like cotton but better no stretch at all which im glad im not a fan of the stretch to me these are those comfy goto jeans i got my usual size which i perfer in these because i can use the pockets with ease the pockets are lower side pocket which are great you will likely need to hem them unless you are pretty tall i hemmed mine and you cant tell it im not sure how much these could be,1
7381,I adore this sweater coat i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews i was not disappointed at all this sweater coat is soft boiled wool the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black grays and berry colorsthe fit appears to be magical it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering which is tricky with my figure hourglass i tend to need a defined waist but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming,1
7382,I wanted to love this top perfect weight length and shape unfortunately the seam goes right through the bust and just does not look right if you are tiny on top this will be lovely on you,0
7383,I am petite purchased the xsmall and it is a little big but had to have this i would say runs a bit large i think it will be a great addition to any wardrobe,1
7384,I live in these shorts all summer long they are so comfortable soft and practical i have purchased a couple of these every summer but this year they were so many pretty colors i ended up with new pair they go with just about everything and are soft and perfect for texas heat i stayed true to size on them,1
7385,Theyre great i saw them featured in one of the marketing emails they looked comfortable and cute different with the leg warmer type bottom i went to the retailer near me but they didnt have them in store this was a slight disappointment because i wanted to try them on for sizing purposes but i ordered them because they were affordable in the range cute comfortable and stylish they also ended up fitting perfectly as well nice job,1
7386,Loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past,1
7387,Im lbs and bought this in size medium because i have long arms and was afraid that the cashmere would shrink even if i handwash and dry flat because lets be honesti doubt ill ever send it to the dry cleaner its loose through the body and arms but the sleeves are the perfect length the term bell sleeve is no exaggeration the sleeves are billowy and voluminous and i can see them getting in the way while washing my hands or doing dishes i guess i will have to reserve this s,1
7388,This is the one the faux fur i have been looking for it is plush and heavy so that it should keep me warm and toasty during the dreaded new england winter i love the richly saturated jewel tones over a base of black there are only two snaps to close the front but there is enough fabric to overlap to keep the cold away maybe winter wont be so bad after allone caveat is that the item description is not truly accuratei initially ordered a petite since the length stated was almost i,1
7389,The shirt is very big it would be cute as a maternity shirt,0
7390,Beautiful sweater i first bought it in black and loved it so much i bought it in burgundy the burgundy one is longer and slightly bigger than the black one and they are both smalls nice thing is i can wear the burgundy one with leggings love the lace on the sleeves and the sweater is a nice weight,1
7391,Cute top the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front its a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think its a flattering shape i got the regular s and dont find it too short for reference im lb b i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit,1
7392,Pretty delicate lace toplove it hits right at waist so not unflattering at hips,1
7393,Love this shirt i am and lbs i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect my new favorite shirt,1
7394,Pretty shirt on the hanger but theres a goof in the design when i tried it on my d self there became this weird ruffle right besidebelow the bust that you can barely see in the right of the photo now that i know its there the tulip nature of the shirt is pretty in concept but where the top layer starts makes the fabric stick out right by your bust and its not flattering and im just a b,0
7395,Great tee the color online is lighter and nicer in my opinion than in reality its much darker in real life but otherwise its a super soft tee with gently fluttered sleeves and side slits i bought it in a s and its roomy without being oversized great for fall,1
7396,The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevignys wardrobe on the set of big love and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman,0
7397,Very comfy with cotton and lots of stretch can be dressed up or down i wear it with blue denim jacket and also with cream cardi and the small is perfect,1
7398,This dress is much cuter in person than it looks on the model online its so flattering it fits like a dream and i love the fabric i love that the skirt is a true aline not poofy so its sleek slimming and flattering the neckline is feminine and gorgeous and is a bit sexy while still being classy oh and the length perfection not too long not too short i never ever pay full price and for this dress i had to i am a curvy size and it fits perfectly true to size i couldnt be hap,1
7399,I didnt think top was very flattering and while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottomjust looks missewn instead of purposeful sadly this one is going back to the store,0
7400,I love this blouse the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background the buttons on the front are also a coralpeach color and beautifully made its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze i ordered a medium which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly im a b and can run from an to a in tops i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can especially for women with a larger bust th,1
7401,Per baily s usual no visible lines hits in all the right places extremely flattering washes well all of it fo this price especially youd be fool to pass this little number up,1
7402,I have a booty and these pants love it they fit my curves size with flat abs but as i said a booty all while looking professional at m y husbands insistence im buying they grey too,1
7403,This dress is so pretty comfortable and easy to wear i got so many compliments in it it is a winner for sure,1
7404,This is another item ive been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i didnt even try it on because i knew it would be going back the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim so much potential just executed poorly,0
7405,Love this dress the description says pull over styling but its not there is a side zipper which i think makes for a better fit i bought a which fit great im lbs and it hits right above the knee,1
7406,Runs true to size for brandretailer clothes xs for lbs but a little tight in the shouldersbiceps if you have fairly developed muscles or just wide shoulders watch out for the skirt riding up when you reach for something or bend over,1
7407,This shirt is adorable but its really just a cotton tshirt based on the picture online i thought it would have more weight be a more substantial fabric again its adorable but not sure how long it will last,1
7408,Love the high rise and stretch of this jean i feel long and lean which is tough for a short curvy girl i feel these run a little small for pilcro i went up a size,1
7409,I love this sweater its heavy with a rich texture that feels like very cool grandma the cut is straight and the collar feels natural a small wraps closed across my chest usually a s without being baggy falls to my midcalf at,1
7410,Love wearing these i see them getting a lot of wear in the winter,1
7411,I was hesitant to order this but i am really glad i did it is just beautiful the quality is excellent i would like it to have more snaps so i am going to add them i cant wait to wear it,1
7412,Purchased this tshirt in white its lightweight and slightly sheer perfect for layering looks cute with a poncho blazer or on its own really wish it was available in black,1
7413,I love ag jeans and these are fabulous i cant say enough about how well ag jeans fit and hold up over time i have several pair i purchased the royal blue color in the store they held their shape all day and were super comfy i decided to purchased two more pairs with the online sale because i know i will be wearing these for a long time,1
7414,I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands and both look great there is no significant difference except medium fell about inch longer i am and size small hem fell about above knee size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so im keeping size small what a beautiful dress although the body of dress is jersey material it is lined so there is good coverage i tend to not like faux leather since they,1
7415,I purchased this top on colorsa great go tostylish soft and very comfortable,1
7416,I bought this dress instore and its fantastic im between a medium and a large and i bought a large because it was the one available and its fantastic some of the polyester is fraying between the seams which is obviously not ideal but im willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is,1
7417,Very warm and snuggly gorgeous color nice fit i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right but managed so it works for work i cant say enough how toasty it is very good quality and styling,1
7418,This fit me perfectly im petite and it is a little long but i like the length its perfect so cute,1
7419,Fit great and cute cannot wait for summer to wear with sandals,1
7420,This is way cuter on the model it runs so big that it is very unflattering perhaps on someone tall it would look better but sadly it looked dumpy on my frame it also arrived with some black stain on it it is going back,0
7421,Cute tee its a casual tee with some nice detailing that gives it some style the fabric is a good thickness not seethrough thin but light enough for warm weather the color should match pretty much anything nice neckline i think it runs slightly large i hover between a small extra small with tops and the xs fit nicely i do have narrow shoulders dd so women with normal to wide shoulders might prefer their usual size i dont expect people to gush over it with compliments but it it a,1
7422,I almost passed this in the store but i am glad that i tried it i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a blouse feel and is machine washable yay love nice blouses that dont need to be dry cleaned i would describe the material as thicker so some may not like this for warmer weather looks great with a long necklace like the minuet i am typically a small and purchased this in an extrasmall and still have plenty of room,1
7423,Great casual jacket its a nice spring weight can be worn in different ways by turning the cuffs folding the collar wrapping or unwrapping etc i love the way they styled it in the model shots i am going to have to disagree with the other reviewers about this being tts i have to say the medium was so oversized it looked like i was wearing a fabric box i have a broad back and ddd bust and am comfortably wearing the size xs,1
7424,Great basic but with a little something special to it great t all around,1
7425,As soon as my eyes touched these pants i knew my body had to not only doo they look great they feel great the material is very soft with just enough stretch theyve quickly become my favorites i loved the first pair so much i immediately bought the other color,1
7426,Love this top looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing it is short so for me the high waist pants were a must but if you dont mind showing your belly then it would be cute with anything the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some overall it was a good fit,1
7427,First of all a caveat i am not curvy at all i am average height but petite in terms of features and bones and such specifically i am feet inches tall and about pounds and boyishly shaped with a feminine and timeless style all this means that i can get overwhelmed by dressesclothes with a lot of fabric or large prints and such if you are shaped like me this dress will be perfect for you it highlights your advantages slim and petite and give you curves that i wish i had natural,1
7428,I love this top it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who dont normally wear sleeveless tops i think it runs very large im normally a size sm and the extra small was right its loose around the waist yet has a feminine fitthe tiny balls around the neck button at the back flutter sleeves and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve,1
7429,Super soft and stylish its a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets love it i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small im and lbs typically wear a size s but sometimes have to size up to a m i got a s fits great not too tight sleeves are plenty long enough i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work aka grad school and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings but its not too bulky so i can keep it on,1
7430,This vest goes with literally everything it is the perfect amount of added warmth though its a bit hard to fit under a coat the only thing i will say negatively about it is that it seems to shed on the inside a bit but otherwise the quality color and length are perfect and i love the pockets,1
7431,I have a different perspective than the other reviewers the fabric is thin and silky perfect for summer it is a pleasant change from other items in my summer closet i bought the small which i typically wear it can easily be dressed up with heels and down with flat sandals finally it has pockets,1
7432,Gorgeous dress worth every pennyone of a kind twist on a kimono,1
7433,Great fit no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size very cute for reference im lbs and take a p they look just like they do on the model i highly recommend,1
7434,This is a beautiful dress for fall the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first i think a l might fit a bit better so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit it is also very long i need to hem it about i never know which size to order with this brand i vary between l and xl,1
7435,Im so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores i didnt really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person i got the navy blue in size which fit tts i got a regular size vs the petite size which i usually like to go with because im short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the models length shown online they seem so versatile im looking forward to wearing these,1
7436,This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath,1
7437,Nice fit very comfortable if you wear a thin shirt underneath,1
7438,The review above titled so disappointed couldnt have said it any better the dresses from last year are perfect i probably wear them at least once a week i was so excited to see this vibrant blue color and fully expected the same quality as last year im generally an xs or s in dresses however i have xxs from last years version and the xs in this one is lifeless its heavy hot doesnt have the same nice shape as last year i may cut out the integrated lining just to lighten the dres,0
7439,Wearing this to a weeding in july its so feminine and pretty runs a little big on top at the arm holes but having it tailored love,1
7440,This dress is lovely and easy to wear if you are short and you buy regular size not petite i am and i bought the regular medium so the length of the front falls just above my knees i can wear it to work without leggings the other thing i love is it has pockets and it fits generously i weigh lbs and will usually fit in a medium if i dont breathe and a large if i use a belt but in this size medium regular i can breathe and i need a belt ergo i dont feel like i need to,1
7441,Definitely a good buy especially when i bought it on sale its warm and can be worn dressed up or down,1
7442,I absolutely love this jacket i wear it almost everyday works as a cardigan or a jacket my favorite retailer purchase so far,1
7443,I love the color patterns and fabric it has full lining my biggest problem with the dress is the swing style makes it more like a maternity dress and so unflattering a straight shift style would have been much better dress runs large however the armshoulder area is tight,0
7444,Really wanted to love this top but the proportion was not right for my body type also the print with the silhouette was a bit too country bumpkin for me,0
7445,I absolutely love this dress the pictures dont do it justice the colors and details are stunning i have only worn it once this far but received a ton of complements,1
7446,Great peplum top beautiful whine color very thick material im hourglass figure d top so it was very flattering,1
7447,The back of this top is very unique and the embroidery looked like it would hold upit does have a boxy shape but it really works with this piece i found it to run true to size compared to other pieces i have from retailer for some reference im and weigh lbs,1
7448,I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down,1
7449,I just received this beautiful suit i have purchased a boyleg from seafolly before and loved itthis color way is totally different it is a white background with a floral pattern that is not over the topi am a dd and wear a clothing size i purchased the this suit definitely will accommodate small bust toomy sister is a b size clothing and it fit as wellway to go retailer with another winner,1
7450,My daughter got this dress in the and i got it in the we are both tall also shes a redhead and got the butterfly version and im blonde and got the pink also both of us are smallchested and since there is no give in the fabric i dont know where one would fit boobs if you have them one thing i noted and i am not happy about is that the back is puckered up along the zipper this has to be on purpose and i dont really understand that detail as it doesnt flatter me and it loo,1
7451,Great dramatic cardigan wearable art and not for the meek ill wear with a leather skirt and boots jeans and boots or a dress and boots if the lack of closure at top bothers you attach something be creative i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn,1
7452,I was so excited to get the dress its extremely beautiful and comfortable the size i picked was unfortunately too big for me though i just had a baby so its hard to figure out what size i am nowdetails were exquisite,1
7453,I am always on the hunt for a white shirt that is not too sheer so that i can wear it without a cami underneath on that count this top is a winnerregarding the fit it is a shorter top so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people i am short waisted and i wouldnt be able to tuck it inin fact i think it is really meant to have an almost cropped fitfyi c d broad shouldersback short waist in a fitted shirt i take a but i tried this,1
7454,This color is perfect deep and rich it is exactly as it looks online the velvet is supersoft on the outside while the inside is more of a woven finish it makes it a little less cozy but the drape is great the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest and full everywhere else the waist is lower in the back than the front so it sits lower on the hip im b and i got a small petite because i liked where it hit my waist better this means i wont be wearing it without tigh,1
7455,I bought this dress for my college graduation and its truly gorgeous i love the loose breezy fit but it did feel just a little bit sacklike on me definitely moreso than i expected from looking at the product picture even after sizing down to a small which was comfortable and im usually a medium i ended up pairing it with a small belt really pretty dress just be advised leaves a lot of room around the waist,1
7456,I got the blue with polka dots it fits more like a midi dress it is a bit large im usually a size and got a size its gorgeous on i dont think ill be needing a bra underneath this its got a supportive band and the ribbon also helps i might order the other bold print too it just looks so good on,1
7457,I came into the store to try another dress on and was given this dress to try it is perfect i paired it with black tights and tall boots for a family photo i got it in the wine color highly recommend and very fun for winter it does run really large i usually wear a small but got an extra small,1
7458,I fell in love with this top on the spot and paid full price for it which is a rarity since everything goes on sale its a beautify top well made and sits well on me i am usually wear a size but got away with an in this one i do have short torso so i can see it having a problem for someone with long torso or someone whos tall whats even better is that it went on sale and the store was nice enough to give me the difference back im thinking about getting the other two colors,1
7459,To my surprise this sweater is heavy chic and stylish its well made and fits tts im looking forward to wearing it i would recommend this tunic to everyone it looks better on me than the modelevent though it doesnt look bad you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater i really like all the different textures in this sweater,1
7460,I love this dress i originally ordered it in a small but returned it for an extra small it fits perfectly love the details so classic and comfortable,1
7461,This is seriously a beautiful dress it has such gorgeous colors its lined so no slip needed it is flowy and just the right length i went with a petite and it is perfect cant wait to use it at the beach,1
7462,The quality of he fabric is amazing the thickness is perfect as to look form fitting while not too tight or thin showing any wrinkles i had been searching for a versatile turtleneck i could dress up or down a finding this was a definite win the style is timeless and with the high quality i know this will be a staple for years to come,1
7463,Perfect semidressy summer top that could definitely go year round love the buttons up the back its flows but the slight peplum keeps it from looking tent like love this so much i ordered another in black,1
7464,I loved this dress before putting it on but it was just not the right cut or style for my body type it is very roomy and full and looked like a maternity dress which was not a look i was going for sadly this will be going back i loved the print and the feel of the material just not a flattering cut for me,0
7465,This dress is comfortable as well as flattering which does not happen very oftenlooks good with navy tights too,1
7466,Does not say ribbed did not want ribbed would not have bought ribbed,0
7467,Got this in the pretty springy blue already wore it with white jeans and loved it love the loose longer swingy style and i cant wait to wear again i may have to get another color,1
7468,I thought this dress was lovely on im an and tried the med which i believe was the right fit it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful definitely buying if it makes it to sale,1
7469,I cant get over how fabulous this looks on how well it fits and how flattering it is im and size on a good day seriously im so happy about it i plan to get a lot of wear out of it works for a wedding evening out or the office,1
7470,This fits like a dream the almost three quarter length sleeves are perfection worth every penny,1
7471,The larkspur tank is colorful and the embroidered bib is beautiful the material is soft but not diaphanous it can hide my little pouch without looking like maternity clothing love it,1
7472,Great shirt that runs true to size i got the turqouise color which is very pretty it cuts lower but doesnt show much cleavage,1
7473,I love this top its very delicate and pretty flattering cut the fabric is sheer so wear with a cami or a pretty bra,1
7474,I purchased this with some hesitation having read that some people thought it was unflattering but i couldnt resist the sale price and i love a lowmaintenance work top and doesnt require ironing this fits the bill perfectly its made of high quality fabric theres a soft inner lining with a side zip closure and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into i got a small but once on it fit perfectly and is so flattering i cant imagine why other,1
7475,I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love its so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed the dress is well lined and darling i am small chested so i didnt have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding i look forward to wearing the dress many times after,1
7476,I love this blazer its perfect for work and makes a great statement,1
7477,I was worried about ordering this top after the first review but i was very pleasantly surprised the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel and a lighter weight knit on the back panel which gives it a flowy quality it looks slender and trim in front with the unexpected surprise in back the transition between the front and back panels is well done which doesnt really show in the photos i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on its uniqueness the first time i wor,1
7478,I tend to go back and forth between small and xs and im glad i got the xs its great and still flow and not huge to wear alone you need a strapless but i am happy it has adjustable straps the lace on the back is fabulous snd the colors in this are so lovely it has olive green and deep orange two of my fall favs i wore with my level deep orange linen pants and an olive green little jacket over it would also be lovely with jeans and booties a creamy cardigan or a little blazer i th,1
7479,Wish this site had ask a question about the product feature like amazon does just wondering if anyone has seen this product in person to verify color it looks orange but descriptor says red would appreciate feedback thank you for your help,1
7480,Love this top however im biased bc i love hd such originality in their clothing even in something as simple as a black tank top also comes with the bra strap snaps but i find my straps still show in the back need to wear a strapless or criss cross please note that the sides sort of rise up to meet the laces so the more you tighten the laces the more it comes up hard to explain if you are at all even a little sensitive about a muffin top again with low rise it would show still l,1
7481,Ordered this dress and still havent recieved it but went to my local store today and tried it on in the size i ordered it was too big and now i cant get it in my size so that stinks quality was good and the dress was comfortable with stretch i know in going to have to return it once it comes,1
7482,The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described it is the most comfortable and flattering onepiece i have ever tried on as noted by other reviewers there is limited support in the chest this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift,1
7483,I bought this suit based on the great reviews i was so bummed when i tried it on the top fit so well but the bottom kept bunching up my torso is on the longer side so maybe thats why the bottoms keep coming up every time i pulled the shorts down the top would come down too and vice versa i am and lbs and bought a which is my normal size i did like that the top had a bit of padding but thats the extent of what i liked about it i will be returning it,0
7484,I think this sweater is well executed for what it isa chunky knit trapeze sweater i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online but it caught my eye in person there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store the interwoven peachy heathery color is sweet and flattering since im i ordered had the petite version to try hope it works out cuz im eager to own something relaxed and cozy thats actually flattering and isnt a sweatshirt,1
7485,I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased the fit is roomy enough to layer but not too large or boxy the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal i get compliments every time i wear itclassic fancy jackie o are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e,1
7486,I love this tunic the fit is ttt and the quality is nice i will get much use out of this piece,1
7487,For me this skirt runs a little large my waist is smaller than my hips so i was able to order a small which fits perfectly im and the length hits at the right spot too so there is no need for hemming i have yet to wear the skirt but i anticipate that it will be a great piece to transition from summer to fall with an easy switch of the shirt and shoes cant wait to get a lot of use out of this one,1
7488,I love this shirt and the colors it brings out this shirt makes a great statement it can be worn with jeans and look great or worn with slacks i great a lot of compliments,1
7489,This is a beautiful skirt im very pleased with the quality it runs small though im usually size small and went for the medium im and got the regular vs petit which would have been too short for me to wear at work,1
7490,I tried this on at the store and am coming online to order it in petite im and the length hit me just below the knee in the regular length so im hoping it will hit just above the knee in petite it was very cute might run a bit large but basically true to size size down if between sizes it has a little bit of sparkle beading around the neck which is nice,1
7491,I absolutely love this light soft cardigan i dont think the pic does it justice the black longer blouse takes away from it i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments only wish it came in additional colors,1
7492,I bought this dress in an xs and am lbs and fairly proportional the shoulders were snug but the hips and maybe waistwere at least x too big comically so the fabric stood away from my body like wings on each side,0
7493,Such a unique mix of prints but it totally works much better and more vibrant in person true to size fits more like a maxi on me since im,1
7494,This caught my eye in the store last week and i decided to try it on its the perfect lightweight jacket the photos here show it as activewear but i think the details on it allow it to be much more versatile its very flattering and i found it to run true to size,1
7495,I liked this dress but wasnt sure about the color on me i tried it on anyway originally i tried on the but it seemed big so i ordered the also usually i order petite but this dress is already short and i am not getting younger so i went with regular size this time color was not bad on my pale skin i think the hue was ok surprisingly one thing that might bug the perfectionist in me the zig zag isnt always aligned the waist for instance was crooked but if it is like that e,1
7496,Wearing these for the first time today the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be the fabric is gorgeous the fit is excellent the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch true to size too these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants theyre something special and worth the moneythe fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase,1
7497,Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape perfect for summer,1

7499,Bought this today and im in love very flattering great fit,1
7500,These socks are soft and comfortable and they are very short so theyll be good with booties i couldnt tell from the pictures but the pale gray dots are surrounded by a border of subtle silver thread theyre adorable,1
7501,This dress is very flattering on and can easily be dressed up or down i was nervous it might be too flowy but it lays very nice and is so pretty on,1
7502,This is a perfect dress for summer in florida it does run larger than it needs to be even for a swing dress no problem i took in the sides several inches on each side and it looks great its very easy to pick the stitches on the straps and make them adjustableit has a nice lightweight full lining my new favorite dress,1
7503,Beautiful dress but have to return way too big long for me medium is the size i wear but i think i would need an extra small,0

7505,This is a stunning top but it did not work for me because it looked like a maternity top on me i think a person needs to be thin with a small bust to carry this off this would look good with many things from ripped denim to leather pants and is not necessarily just for holidays,1
7506,This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer the sleeves are so weird and ugly they get really fat at the top like a dolman sleeve but it looks really strange because they dont flow into the rest of the top which is very structured it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders this is not apparent in the model picture at all the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri,0
7507,Its super soft it fits great happy with the purchase,1
7508,I am an retailer employee i immediately fell in love with this dress i tried it on and it was way to long as always with regular store sizesi am short i wanted to order but it was backordered for about a month i ordered it anyway my husband and i took a mini vacation to chicago over easter weekend and in the miracle mile store they had the dress in my petite size i was in heaven as they had an awesome petite area in the store there i purchased a petite which is the size i,1
7509,I love this top the fit is perfect and i particularly like the longer back there is a split between the shorter front and longer back which is brilliant so you can move and sit without it pulling around your bum looks great with skinny jeans or with leggings it is very light weight and is perfect for spring the sleeves are slightly fitted and very comfortable the quality and construction is great i am feet and got a petite xs which is perfect,1
7510,c waist love a thin pullover early fall weight great for layering or on its on darling with a skirt or jeans buttons down the back for looks bought the small tts fits like in the picture hits at the hip colors in photo are accurate would be darling oversized too it has just the right amount of fun without entering the stratosphere of crazycatlady level no bows on the back id hand wash this one if you still love bows but dont want to be mistaken for being,1
7511,I noticed that someone wrote a review about how after washing her shirt she hated it well i have washed mine or times already and have never ironed it i do use fabric softener and i take it out and hang it to dry after it has tossed in the dryer for about minutes it is not meant to be a crisp dress shirt but a soft casual shirt and as i said before i have not ironed it once it looks like it did when i bought it even straight out of the dryer i own the yellow and pink,1
7512,These were great pants that fit well had good rise perfect stretch for my curves and i was really happy to get them on sale im lbs with a pear shape after only three months of occasional wear about once a week at most and following wash instructions perfectly they started deteriorating the pockets are becoming unsewn the fabric has overstretched in little sections that bunch and the bottom hem is coming unraveled these are the most lowquality horrible pants ive,0
7513,I really love the idea behind this however the fit doesnt work for me im usually a s or xs in retailer tops and i often go with xs for sleeveless tops this one runs small though the xs was a bit too small on me based on length and width the neckline was very high higher than it looks in the model photo and the armholes were too big so i dont think sizing up would improve matters much due to the armhole issue the other criticism is that the front is not lined,0
7514,I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans khaki shorts and camo pedal pushers added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top im loving that it shows off my shoulders theyre tan from my vacation and ive been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym its well made too,1
7515,I stared at this dress for a long time online and finally went into the store and tried it on it is a beautiful quality and material note that it is ivory not pure white which is exactly what i was looking for the fit is more of an aline and it is slightly long which is part of the style of the dress i am taking it with me to a beach vacation in mexico but i plan to wear to many more occasions because this could easily be dressed up or down just dont wear it to a wedding since it is a w,1
7516,All of my friends loved these pants as did i these are so gorgeous the sequins seem well stitched the small fit me well hanging straight as pictured not too snug or uncomfortable they hit me at the ankle there are back pockets,1
7517,The fabric is super soft and litght it hardly feels like you are wearing it body skimming fit can disguise a less than perfect figure can easily go from day to night absolutely love,1
7518,This skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace great find,1
7519,This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design it is a very unique flowing romantic piece it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath i am normally a size small and bought a size i tried on a in the store just to see what it looked like fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size love it,1
7520,These would have been the perfect black pants great cut love the wide band in the front true to size quality construction but a zipper in the back i had to ask my husband to help me zip them up perhaps they would be easier to put on if my bum were a little smaller but the pants fit perfectly they were just too hard to put on sending them back since i dont have an assistant to zip them up whenever i need,0
7521,This dress is wonderful fits perfect very comfortable wonderful colors,1
7522,I purchased this tee in the blue and it is so very cute its such a soft thin tee and a delight to wear on these hot summer days i went with xs on this one and i still have plenty of room i have paired it with jean shorts capris and it goes really well with the pilcro hypen chino shorts,1
7523,Interestingly the description said this was blue but as it looks on the picture it is more grey that being said about the zippie love my stylist i brought it in for a try on session at my local store said you know how i feel about sweats i wont like it joke on her she turned around and was ok i shouldnt have looked love the ruffles at the bottomit makes this sweater much more special it is actually really cute for casual day jeans tshirt kids or over sweats any,1
7524,This shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures i love the fit and felt great in it on a moms night out with jeans and heals i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about love it,1
7525,Longtime ag jeans fan lately though im finding the material is much too stretchy i wanted a good pair of jeans if i wanted pajama jeans i wouldve ordered them i found the same thing with the prima jeans i ordered same review thereso back both pairs went its a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted if only they had been made out of actual jeans material,0
7526,These pants are super comfy and fit true to size i went up to a size large because i wanted them extra roomy and longer im and lbs and generally wear a size in pants i highly recommend them for stylish and comfy lounge pants,1
7527,I tried this on at the store the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft it does run on the big and flowy side i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out ill snap it up if it goes on sale,1
7528,Great top i have both colors because the front is short i ordered a medium i usually wear a small if you are not long waisted like me order the small,1
7529,I bought this coat shortly after christmas and am in love it is meant to fit oversize but runs true to your natural sizing i am a ml in most retailer clothing and that is what i bought it is great for layering for a dressed up look with a skirt or dress for work and also dressed down with jeans a tshirt and although the arms are length it is super warm so happy i purchased,1
7530,The shoulder bearing aspect makes this top sexy yet it doesnt look like youre trying too hard sleeves can be worn up or down and everything stayed in place either way i get tons of compliments each time i wear this,1
7531,Flattering comfortable and a fantastically versatile color and style if youd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model id say that its tts the picture represents the color accurately is a very dark slate grey ive found that the color is a great neutral i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors as featured on the model the style is also really versatile i can wear it as a standalone tshirt or under a blazer to workive washed the garment once on the,1
7532,This top is adorable normally wear small or xs but got xxs based on reviews and glad i did still really loose but so cute would have preferred petite but sold out,1
7533,I was pleasantly surprised by how well this dress skims over the body definitely needs the belt that comes with the dress to add some shape the color is gorgeous great print and very light fabric perfect for summer,1
7534,The fit on these is amazing and the color is great too sometimes the fading is too much on jeans but this is just right the rise fits really well and the length is great love pilcro,1
7535,This skirt is beautiful the green really pops and makes the skirt stand out it runs true to size definitely a great addition to your wardrobe,1
7536,I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price i absolutely adore it in my opinion it isnt too thick or too thin i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly there are side slits so its perfect with skinny jeans or leggings its flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric also with the grey color there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction so this adds some additional visual appeal i havent had any problems with snagging,1
7537,This top has so many details i love the material it adds a little formal to the casual jean i am waiting to wear this come fall weather with slim jeans and some boots it gives me that old victorian vibe without being still and formal,1
7538,This dress hits flatters the whole body love the three quarter sleeves love the relaxed fit of the bottom half love how it is fitted body conscious around bust super flattering the teal color is particularly gorgeous a color that would suit a lot of different skin tones this is a nobrainer dress that you will reach for in your closet every single time,1
7539,I saw this dress couple weeks ago and i really liked its color the dress was ok untill i wore it well its one of those dresses which are not great on hanger but great on you well the color is awesome matches with other bright colors mustard yellow wine or black the material is very thin so if you put size down it will fit but make sure that you see yourself in the mirror and see your back i saw many ladies which put the dress which fits them but it does not fit the way it supposed to,1
7540,Drapes very nicely and runs true to size easy to wear alone or layer a jacketcardigan over i purchased this on sale and it was a good buy i am and purchased the size m as i am a pretty true size,1
7541,In retailers defense silk chiffon in general is super fragile got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful im lbs and took an xs fits true to size im able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags i was able to pull the thread back inside the top never ever cut silk chiffon i love the top so much i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up un,1
7542,This shirt was exactly what i was looking for its fitted at the top with just the right amount of swing some of retailers shirts can have too much swing for me but this is just right the color is great too,1
7543,I love this jacket but in contrast to the other reviewers find it to run a little small i usually wear a small at retailer and got a size medium as the small was a little tight under the armpits this might be because i have a large chest but i wanted more room in case i want to layer,1
7544,Shouldve ordered a larger size it runs a bit tight around the top and the zipper isnt that helpful,1
7545,I wanted so much to love this dress but unfortunately the fit was so poor i had to return it the color of the dress green was lovely and i liked the fabric and the overall design very much i read the reviews and decided to order an extra small petite given that reviewers said the dress ran large but even at that size the dress was too large especially around the hips which for someone with an hourglass figure is saying a lot the extra fabric around the hips belled out some making,0
7546,I ordered the p in red and love these pants the only problem is even in petites these are long on me maybe ok with inch heels the cut is comfortable and flattering i have muscular thighs and these fall nicely on me the color is also nice for this fall i purchased last years version grey and turquoise but reverse from what is offered this year and they are very comparable although i bought them too big last year fabric not prone to easy wrinkling highly recommend reference,1
7547,The fit and feel of this top is lovely great shirt to layer fits great i get compliments every time i wear it,1
7548,This skirt is amazing it has the right amount of sparkle and the right amount of shape i bought this in a size six which i can really switch between and depending but the six fits perfectly i also bought the regular length even though i could probably be considered petite but it ended up being perfect but the skirt is so lovely in person and has just enough wow that you can wear this thing with a simple tee and still look amazing i wore this to a party with a black high neck tank and re,1
7549,I love this blazer its so comfortable i just wonder if the company makes more inserts in different fabricscolors id love to be able to change it up a bit,1
7550,Very feminine comes with a coordinating cami i liked it so much that im going to order the other color too,1
7551,This blouse is so pretty and well made it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day loose in a flattering way it does not look like a maternity top very happy,1
7552,I just received my backordered wildberry top in blue its not blue but instead a dull mottled purplish hue it looks like a wellworn stretched out tee shirt with a tired ruffle along the bottom so disappointing its going back for sure,0
7553,I highly recommend this dress i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static but nothing that a little static guard couldnt prevent i purchased a medium petite and i am about feet tall usually a size in dresses and it fit perfect wore for thanksgiving the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk which i love,1
7554,This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern,1
7555,I was hesitant about buying this at first because im busty fcup but i love this top and have received a lot of compliments on it and then i tried it on again at home with leggings and loved it its a great spring time top to wear with leggings and boots,1
7556,Wow this is a keeper love how soft and special the color feels the knit for back and arms makes it very comfy and easy to wear not really easy to layer it since arms pretty fitted love it with jeans since the back ends at waist,1
7557,Oh dear the elastic waistband just ruined this skirt for meit made it look so cheap i assumed from the photograph that the skirt was a knit over a structured lining with a real waistband with a zip instead its a sweatshirt knit with no lining and elastic it looked cheap and hung a bit baggy from the elastic waist making it a nogo for me,0
7558,This shirt is soft long and is the perfect pair for leggings i am only ft tall so this is extra long on me in the front and back i bought it in colors and hope to get more i bought a large and love how it covershides my trouble areas,1
7559,I was so sad not to love this dress it is beautiful but is so unflattering on there is a lot of material under the arms and it gathers up due to the smocking so it just made me look incredibly frumpy i dont really think a petite would have helped the gathers just bunch a bit and so rather than hang the dress sort of clumps i am lean but broad shouldered and maybe that is the problem but i was super disappointed narrow shouldered people with long torsos could pull this off it is a t,0
7560,I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory i got a size and i would say it is true to size the fabric is very comfortable and doesnt wrinkle easily it does have a flowy look to it but i didnt find that it had too much fabric i wouldnt tuck it in though i find it looks really good with skinny jeanspants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique i recommend the shirt,1
7561,Purchased this sweater in an xs grey pattern for reference small frame and was worried it would be too overwhelming this is not the case the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right it seems to be true to size i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves its a little pricey but i think it will be worth it because it is so different,1
7562,I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small im usually an but needed this in a this shirt is reallly just perfect great sleeve length just the right amount of v neck beautiful pattern with a vintage feel i love the combo of stripes polka dots and sweet flowers,1
7563,This dress looks nothing like the photo the sequins are dull no sheen at all the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap shiny plastic i didnt even try it on because it was so hideous when i pulled it out of the box not remotely worth the price and wouldnt buy it on sale for either skip,0
7564,Very flattering cut very loose flowy runs a little big for a small but fits well for someone who sometimes fits medium depending on the cut i need to wear a bralette with this top,1
7565,I had my eye on this dress for months i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures it was very bright which disappointed me its also made for more busty women at a d i could in no way fill this dress out the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering i felt like an old lady in a bag,0
7566,I was so excited to get these i paid for two day shipping and ordered medium and large sadly they did not fit i usually wear medium but ordered both just in case im very disappointed that they run so small and are not true to size they are super cute from someone skinny,0
7567,Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and im in love i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow is perfect i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didnt have petites in the store i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere overall i am so pleased with this purchase so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it,1
7568,This top is comfortable and vas easily be dressed up or down love it,1
7569,This dress is beautifully tailored and so flattering i feel very comfortable wearing it to work because of the sleeves and neckline but think it would also be good to wear out im so happy i bought it,1
7570,Great fit colors look just like the pic not too heavy but warm and cozy,1
7571,This sweater was not as featured in the picture the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length the front barely reached the middle of my stomach also the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture this sweater will be going back,0
7572,This dress is amazing i bought it for an afternoon wedding im attending its perfect it fits like a glove and the lace is so delicate the nude sheath really allows the lace and all the details to stand out love it in the black,1
7573,I was not so sure i would like this dress as i was afraid it may be too boxy looking per other reviews i took a chancei love itso sweet with my grey boots and just dressy enoughbut still casual and fundetail work is very nicely done,1
7574,Beautiful dress that is very flattering wearing it to my bridal shower more appropriate for spring or summer,1
7575,Top of the line very well made and on sale to boot i love the style and received a compliment from my sister when i wore it i love the layered look,1
7576,This top is gorgeous in person im in love with it its perfect for the holiday season it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit,1
7577,This shirt is amazing its an excellent heavier weight quality tshirt but so comfortable if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fallwinterspring this is it i am lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly the band around the wrist is a nice touch making this a higher quality tee i am buying more colors,1
7578,Its a soft comfy fabric cute ruffle may be a little on the bigger side but still super cute very form fitting but still fits true to size imo the olive color is even more beautiful in person,1
7579,Really cute everyday dress love the fabric and material its super soft a great dress to just throw on and go,1
7580,Beautiful tee and cut with a classic simple silhouette nice weight and true to size im and the small fits me like i like not tight at all with room to allow for shrinkage i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little selfconscious in due to the low cut neck maybe if i werent as small chested this wouldnt be an issue for me i definitely recommend this tee,1
7581,Loved it as soon as i opened the boxits a lighttomedium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front i wasnt sure about the flowers online but like em the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the vneck back is an unexpected addition this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall cant wait for the weather to cool down,1
7582,This t is very cute and comfortable could be worn casually or dressed up a little bit with jeansvery cute pattern on the shoulder area love this top,1
7583,Lovely socks great color stitched well a little thin,1
7584,This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall a little short in the front but still a great shirt,1
7585,This top is tight across the bust i am a dd cup and more trapezeshaped than the picture shows if you are smaller busted it may not flare out as muchalso the sz is what was tight and i usually wear a sz or or smallsize topblousein the end this wasnt very flattering as it looked more like a maternity top,0
7586,I fell in love with this skirt at the store but was concerned i wouldnt have enough to wear with it i ended up purchasing it online and when it arrived found that it goes with so many things black turtleneck as pictured navy blue blouse with bird print white tshirt white blouse the options are endless fits true to size too short to wear to work but will be perfect for spring and summer weekends cant wait for the weather to warm up,1
7587,Love this sweater i have it in cream and ordering navy it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit i am and weigh and usually buy medium to large,1

7589,I like this layer for fall for many reasons first of all the color is a beautiful fall color the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather it is not too heavy its fairly lightweight i am a size and the small fit perfectly,1
7590,I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops the fabric is heavier so it is not good for hot weather the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors you can see if you zoom in so it has an interesting texture very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy,1
7591,I love these pants i have worn them a number of times already this season i am so i did have to have them hemmed i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still or on the pants so i dont think they look odd i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks,1
7592,This is a gorgeous wellfitting top i was hesitant to even try it on because i was sure it would require a strapless bra which i avoid nope worked perfect with my nude bra i am d so need a real bra but wore an unlined underwire bra with no show through great with denim shorts or more polished with dressy pants or dark jeans,1
7593,I love this top from the details on the cuffs to the draping at the neck to the lightweight yet very highquality material this top is my new winterspring transition piece im small chest and a slight curve in the hips the arms of this top fit me fine but because the fabric doesnt stretch you may find the sleeves too fitted the length is perfect for hiding the butt without looking like pajamas about midthigh ive paired it with cuffed jeans and sneakers like the model is w,1
7594,Dress is comfortable feels great and the fit exceeds flattery the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute fun but still classic detail that i didnt notice in the picture online i love this dress and get so many compliments,1
7595,I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way the waistband is very fitted but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips its also see through fit is tts,0
7596,I love paige brand pantsthey are soft comfortable and forgiving i love these and want them badly the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flareit is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like thisand paige has done a wonderful job for my bodymy store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length they were significantly too long for me probably inches to long i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for,1

7599,I had purchased the black color of this sweater at full price and loved it so much that when i saw the burgundy color go on sale i knew i had to have it this sweater is very comfortable and elevates any look with its lace down the sleeve mock neck collar and slightly flared silhouette its so fun to find different shirts to wear underneath to get a whole new look highly recommend would have gotten all colors,1

7601,I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it i bought the navy in size xs the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful although you dont have to be young to look good in this dress the dress is fitted but the skirt flares making it flattering if you have hips like me the material is not too heavy so you can wear this seasons fall winter spring as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short i am so it does hit well above my knees this isnt an is,1
7602,I found this top in my local store there were two colors available this coral color and a deep teal color i purchased the teal in a m which is one size down from my normal size it drapes beautifully it is a tunic length but not too long i love the way it makes my shoulders look i have athletic shoulders and halter styles are best in the summer for me this tank will require a strapless bra i plan to wear a bandeau but i am not very big up top anyhow love this top if it gets release,1
7603,Love these they are thick and comfortable they feel like sweat pants but are cute enough to wear out if you are running quick errands definitely recommend,1
7604,The skirt material is super comfortable hte cut is also pretty flattering i dont hink this picture does the skirt justice the regualr size was a little long on me i would order a petite if like me you are went xs at lbs the skirt is also a bit stretchy not stiffcolor is way prettier in person i never looked twice at th skirt online but in the store it looked myuch prettier,1

7609,I bought this shirt immediately because of the pattern when it arrived i was super confused its not a tee shirt like it looks like in the photos its made with cotton fabric with a tiny bit of stretch i ordered the xl because i have brought shoulders and e bras size and it fits like a x or larger i would say order two sizes down also it hangs like a maternity shirt i might order it once its on sale which it definitely will be but even then am not positive i would keep it,0
7610,Love embroidery,1
7611,These have become my goto shorts as i can dress them up or down,1
7612,What a cute top i would say true to size it is a pullover so i went with a for easy dressing the scalloped tank around the shoulders is unique and lays nicely i would say the top is a lined in cut not too swingy at all a great length to be left out or tucked in i can think of so many uses for this top i may grab another to keep on hand will be adorable with skirts or shorts,1
7613,Love this dress the fit is amazing i wore it to church for my brothers wedding and got so many compliments it looks great in photos too,1
7614,The embroidery is breathtaking it is more flattering and interesting in person i would highly recommend it it is true to size figure flattering and unique the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece this is it,1
7615,Beautiful top runs true to size im in between an xs amp small and went with the xs it fit great and was beautiful for holiday photos it has hints of silver in it,1
7616,Love these pants i am and these fit in length nicely,1
7617,Although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found the fit is nice but i wouldnt buy it due to the material being too delicate,0
7618,This dress is so beautiful in person but the quality was very upsetting i had two buttons come off before even putting it on i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldnt wear it,0
7619,Its hard to go wrong with the charlies especially in this fabric keep them coming i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well they fit pretty true to size id say try both your usual size and one size down as well they stretch out a little so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric try wearing a burnt orange green or pink the isabella sinclair grid wrap but,1
7620,Just purchased it in store very soft and cozy great neutral color too i am usually s but bought it m just to have it slightly oversized,1
7621,So lovely perfect print graphic want to buy in both colors but the yellow is perfection,1
7622,But when i saw this top in person urged by my stylist when they got it in i decided to try it on they had xs in store my former normal size xs or xsp that was too big though not being sure how the petite would look and not sure if smaller would work i decided to order all three xxs xsp and xxspverdict on size xxsp was pulling at the arm holes kind of small there xxs regular was almost right but arm holes were a little high not as comfortablexsp ended up being the right c,1
7623,This top has great detailing and color does run a little big but adds to the style and movement of the tank the stitching around the bottom makes it cute for layering,1
7624,I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on and it was a great fit first time around i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look the material is very soft the pattern is subtle plaid and the liner is a plus size regular fits me very comfortably im b waist hips i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod,1
7625,I was so impressed with the style boning on the sides for the perfect fit its truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd,1
7626,Material is thin with a fleece like feeling on the inside hard to describe but almost feels like a really thin north face material the cut on the sides of chest area is super awkward shows way too much would never be appropriate to wear a regular bra underneath,0
7627,Fits true to size with good coverage stayed put when i was in the pool,1
7628,I was hesitant to try this top on because i thought it might be too tight and then was delighted to find that it is so comfortable and flattering i am usually a m and the m fit me great i have to disagree with another reviewer that this top is for those of us b cup or smaller i am a d and it fit me great its got enough give and support great fabric and wrap design to fit a wide range of bust lines its a great blend of being attractive without being too revealing i love it got it in b,1
7629,I liked the design and the shirt did fit well enough but the thin fabric does not justify the price it looks like it will get holes in it after a wash or two,0
7630,I love tiny button down tops this one didnt work at all for me i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on,0
7631,I get so many compliments when i wear this colors are great and print is unique perfect for fall,1
7632,Why do designers keep making crop tops i cant imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work i am between a and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so s,0
7633,This sweater is a dull off white color it looks old fashioned dont get,0
7634,Side slit goes up far when seated so beware wear on a non bloated day but very comfy and unforced sexifiedwore it with a fluffy sweater lots of looks,1
7635,Love the fitnot so tight you can wear a short top with these but not slouchy either color goes with everything for wrinkles i hung them and sprayed with waterwrinkles gone bought pair for traveling,1
7636,This is a beautiful cardigan its effortless lightweight with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print i wanted to love thisthe detail the length the weight and the color are all so dreamybut for me the arms were super tight normally im a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweatersand i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping i couldnt even get the cardigan on my arms there is no s,1
7637,This dress is wonderful wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection making it look supertiny the design is simple but very cleverits feminine flattering and slimming my only quibble is that its quite long and im almost in my stocking feeti will have to wear heels or have it hemmed highly recommend,1
7638,This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round i couldnt wait for this to arrive it looks and fits just like the pictures great quality and value is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit i have worn it several times and in addition to looking great does keep you warm,1
7639,This is the most beautiful dress so many beautiful patterns the zipper across the front and belt across the front is so flattering and sexy beautiful flower applique on the hips everything about this dress is magnificent,1
7640,This is a beautiful springsummer dress and the quality of the materials is great i wanted to love it but the sizing is ridiculous im and and i think you could fit three of me comfortably in the xs while the pictures of the model in the dress dont suggest it has a shapeless cut it definitely looked like a sack on me a sack with a lovely print but still an illfitting sack,0
7641,I have been looking for a long jacket with personality for a while now i got one from retailer years ago and ive been looking for something just as great walked into the store and fell absolutely in love the fit is true to size i prefer my jackets pretty fitted the color seemed a bit rosey in the store but now that im home seems more tan and brown its not going to be super warm perfect for fall in colorado and warmer winter days its soft so soft not bulky at all if this is your s,1
7642,Love it got a lot of compliments with itbuy it its worth it especially with the sale price right now,1
7643,Its amazingi did size down on this one but i didnt have to that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter but not too tight my normal size would have alleviated this problem but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my,1
7644,I really love this top its cute whimsical and comfy i received many compliments on it its a really good length and good quality happy i purchased it especially during the tag sale,1
7645,I drooled over this dress online so couldnt pass up trying it on at my local retailer store while i loved the unique color in person the drape of the skirt good quality fully lines i was so disappointed with the top of this dress its very tight illfitting just plainweird i cant imagine the fit of the top being flattering on anyone regardless of chest size its a shame because otherwise the dress is adorable,0
7646,I purchased this dress on super sale and im so happy i did it looks better on me than on the model and thats never the case the material is soft corduroy with comfortable give it moves with me true to size i ordered a size and for reference im lbs c love this staple fallwinter piece i wore it to a conference for work with footless tights and a black cardigan i cant say enough how comfortable it is on it has a structured give if that makes any sense love it,1
7647,This is so cute with a shirt or tee under neath the look is better with a shirt underneath very adorable for many occassions i ordered the petite sizing bc i like my pants more cropped,1
7648,Top is completely see through i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like it is a cute design but not practical at all,0
7649,The dress is not the beautiful color in the pictureit is a very yellowish cream the fabric is thick and does nothang pretty very disappointed had to return it,0
7650,Just love this sweater have it in both colors can be dressed up or more casual,1
7651,I received so many compliments on this dress i purchased my usual size and it fit fine i agree with some other reviewers that i could have probably gone a size down for a more snug fit,1
7652,So comfortable and warm so nice to lounge in a cold day and be cute,1
7653,First of all this dress is not cotton it is silk it also not a pullover dress it has a side zipper and does not have an elastic waist like the description says lastly it is not by moulinette souers ive really never seen a description so far off on one of the items pictured nevertheless it is a gorgeous dress the silk is beautiful and can easily be worn for fall with a sweater or jacket the waist is a little poofy and the chest is a bit snug however i was able to go down a siz,1
7654,Love this top very flattering love it so much i actually wish it was a dressa knit summer dress with a tie at the waist would be perfect seems to run a little big so if youre deciding between sizes size down,1
7655,Went to the local store today for something else and left with this in the cream color it is just simply awesome i could have worn the s but felt that the m would be a little better im between a s and m most of the time cant say enough good things about the quality and versatility of this sweater great piece for cooler summer nights and for a cover up for pilatesyoga cant wait to wear it and now im tempted by the teal,1
7656,Great little shift dress for me it seemed to run true to size im and curvy the regular size fit perfect about above the knee a really fun design with the fringe cant wait to wear once the snow is completely gone,1
7657,This dress is perfect for spring and early summer it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully it is very well made and the fabric is good quality the color is a medium color gray much prettier than in the picture i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture the length was just as it looked on the model i am,1
7658,Pictures do not do justice to this beautiful piece of art the embroidery and jewel detail is exquisite just dont plan on holding any kids or pets you wont want to snag it or them,1
7659,As with my other pilcro pants i love the fit of these jeans very soft fabric but dont stretch out too much after first wearing the fabric is distressed but not so much that i worry about holes forming,1
7660,Fun sexy underwear but rides up in the front will return,0
7661,My expectations were blown away in the best way when i tried on this top i typically have issues with buttondowns in the chest area buttons never lay flat and this top lays perfectly the material is super soft looks great buttoned all the way up or with a few buttons left open i cant wait to wear with a pair of black highwaisted jeans this fall,1
7662,This shirt is wonderful i love the styling and the print sure to be a favorite,1
7663,This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors it is formfitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions i plan to wear it for my sons graduation but i think there are many potential uses for this dress be aware that like many byron lars sheath dresses the bottom part is very tight makes it hard to fit for more pearshaped people the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t,1
7664,The cups on this suit are ridiculous unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor seams were messed up a big pull right on the front i brought it back sad because the design was adorable just poor execution,0
7665,I think this tshirt is so cute simple but cute i originally ordered this in medium i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big my normal size is small so i reordered it it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath i plan to wear this to my year olds gymnastics class it is little yoga people but close enough i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well,1
7666,Really cute top love the ruffle detailing and the pattern quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer either way im happy with the top got my usual xs and it fit perfectly its meant to be a looser top so i dont mind that it runs a little bigger,1
7667,I like the look and fit of this shirt can be dressed up or more casual i got the purple motif although i also like the brown and think that with all of the black in there on the brown one it would give a dressier look i usually wear small from retailer although this is my first blouse from this brand ended up getting an xs regular i wanted the sleeves to fit at as shown in the pics but still be loose i had a ton of extra room in the small and the sleeves hit at wrist bone,1
7668,This is a cute pair of jeans it has a slight flare and just right amount of fringe they are super soft and and the color is slightly lighter than in photos tts not too low hitting right below belly button and a just the right crop length for my height falling ri right above my ankle,1
7669,This is a great quality top it did not look great on me since i am quite top heavy but is lovely,1
7670,I really like this top bought it in purple but i would not call it that it is more maroon or burgundy color is exactly what it shows in the online photo really like the green also crocheted arms are super i found it ran slightly small so if you are between sizes order up one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida even though we do get cooler weather here i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it it will be too warm for me t,1
7671,I tried on a size in the store just for fun i am a petite and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up the p was actually fine yes it is a little hard to zip up but once on it is totally fine not even too snug but i didnt sit and eat we shall see i dont plan on ordering the size up i think the zipper needed some wiggling,1
7672,From quality to design and overall comfortthese leggings have it all they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing its just enough to add a little something i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black for the price its more than worth it,1
7673,I love the way these jeans look and fit but they have a chemical smell i assumed the odor would go away after i washed them but it doesnt seem to have helped,0
7674,I am lbs dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top the mint green is very pretty and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being seethru it is super soft and pretty and doesnt cling i love it,1
7675,Living in alaska means fall starts early and winter runs long this great little skirt is perfect for casual fridays and weekends i am and ordered the petite which is a little big around the waist but could tuck a sweater or shirt in absolutely love this skirt and thinking about purchasing in another color,1
7676,I normally wear a xs but i got a small so it would be a little longer great quality and adorable,1
7677,I fell in love with the color scheme and knew this would be perfect for vacations and weddings colors are slightly muted in reality seems the retailer filter adds more contrast but its still gorgeous lining is full length theres a zipper going up the back fitted at the waist and ribbon ties at the back of the neck that are long enough to style at the throat if wanted i wasnt sure of my size so i picked my larger range and im glad i did my weight fluctuates so when it goes down t,1
7678,So i tried this on in the store and ended up with the size almost could have gone with a size even though im lbs and c the dress is beautiful the color is exactly as pictured brilliant red the linen is nice and summery it does make it billow just a tad in the back because of the fabric but not anything to complain about if i could change just one thing on this dress it would be the length it just feels a little short for being such a classic and classy dress just needs,1
7679,These are truly slouchy leggings i am short so they do bunch quite a bit for me but when paired with a long chunky sweater they are perfect unlike the other review i felt that they ran a little on the larger side i am typically an and ordered the ml they sit nicely on my lower waist and do not sag but the length is long long long i recommend these for wearing out or around the house,1
7680,Ordered in the orange and they are so cute i had to order the other two colors my normal size fit tts i am happy with the fabric fit and color i have an athletic build and had no issues with the side zip waist hip or thighs,1
7681,Fabulous dressclip off the tags because they show through the lace on the back you can see this on the back photo of one recent reviewer,1
7682,Its lightweight soft slinky unike the average tshirt the slinkiness makes it skim the body nicely,1
7683,This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work to a bbq or to happy hour i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model,1
7684,Great as a beach coverup i paired it with a slip underneath and a belt and it looks amazing cant wait to wear it on the beaches of the bahamas soon,1
7685,This dress is not flattering the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy like the other reviewer said its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didnt help regardless the length is not accurate either i would say its a pretty short dress mid thigh but that probably depends on the person it also makes you look very horizontal i was really excited about this dress but its getting r,0
7686,I love this sweater i was nervous after reading the reviews but ordered it anyway and im so glad i did i got it in grey the tie backvback feature is my favorite part flirty and feminine unique but also subtle i dont think the material is scratchy it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts but i wouldnt call it scratchy it was perfectly comfortable to me i will say that its a little short though i vary between a m and l depending on the shirt long torso c,1
7687,I have been eyeing this dress online for a while but never could justify the price well when it went on sale i couldnt pass up the opportunity it arrived today and is even better than i expected very flattering cut long enough for tall people im and beautiful colors i ordered s my usual size in retailer dresses im lbs c and it fits perfectly this will definitely be my goto dress for the rest of the summer i love all my retailer dresses but sometimes find them a tad,1
7688,This top is spectacular intense and color soaked i got bleu super stretchy and comfy the twisty part hugs and emphasizes your curveseven size a like me the v neck is not too wide and low cut it is narrower close fitting and attractive the seam in the middle thorax is a tad strange but it needs to exist due to the twist design overall this top is cute long and lets say men and women of all ages will enjoy it it will make you beautiful on the outside and inside it is not my usual,1
7689,When i saw these in the store i liked how they were different from usual leggings and the nice fabric weight i especially liked how they were not tight at the ankle and fit similar to a pair of ankle pants since i wanted a slightly looser fit i usually wear a i went w a medium cant wait for the weather to get colder so i can wear them with a sweater and ankle boots,1
7690,This is the second top i have purchased in this design the first being in the navy blue color i loved the effortless swing of this shirt and the comfortable cotton texture that i chose to purchase it in wine and have since received many compliments on both the shape and color this is an easy top for me to put on and feel good within,1
7691,I love this top it falls in a romantic and easy way its very flattering and looks great i just had a baby two weeks ago so it hides my insecurities and post baby bump i had many compliments and felt so comfortable so ordered it in the green color i wish there were more,1
7692,I just bought this dress yesterday in the store and love it im b and purchased the p which fits perfectlyits made of a cool material and is lined which adds to the quality of the dress i love the neutral print and the square vneck makes it a little different than just an average dress this dress can be dressed up or down depending on accessories it also makes a great work dress if you add a little cardigan or blazer very versatile and a great buy especially a the s,1
7693,I loved this coat in the picture and couldnt wait to get it sadly it did not deliver in real life i got my usual size small and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves and okay in front the big problem was the back it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape and a lot of extra fabric i considered trying the xs but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable and honestly i cant believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work maybe i got a defectiv,0
7694,This sweater is super soft and the metallic banding is a really nice detail the fabric could turn out to be a bit fragile though if you have a chest it may feel a bit boxier than you expect but i dont mind it for a comfy cozy soft sweater,1
7695,This is cut very strangely im short waisted and this barely covered my belly button the material is rough and scratchy did not like at all and will be returning,0
7696,These pants were a wonderful addition to my wardrobe the fun print and texture add interest but at the same time are not too busy they seem wellmade and they have a slim and flattering fit the side zipper is also a nice touch i would definitely recommend this item,1
7697,Super cute dress swingy flattering easy to wear the pattern is great and i felt like it was the perfect length for me though im short so it may be too short for someone taller the dress runs big im usually a but i got this is a only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk,1
7698,I bought this is in the gray color although imo it has more of a greenish hue i love it its a wide boxy fit like others have said and tends to fall off the shoulder i purchased it in the small my typical size and it definitely seems to run large it relaxes too as i wear it giving it an even roomier feel that said its very cozy comfortable i wear a tank underneath works well for s and s weather,1
7699,So happy with this top i love the fabric the colors and the flowy fit definitely recommend,1
7700,I want to love this shirt i really do but its huge the top is tentlike which would be adorable with skinny jeans however the length of the back dips so low the top kind of reminds me of pajamas the color is beautiful more like a light grey heather and the white piping is like a shimmery ribbon material overall the top is cute but it dips too low in the back and the bow weighs down the back of the shirt so it makes it hard to adjust it in the front sadly its a return,0
7701,Nice thick fabric lays well sleeves three quarter but looks great on,1
7702,A must have piece every time i wear this i get compliments its very flattering amazing quality soft material good support and vibrant colors i wish this came in more colors and patterns worth the money no questions asked,1
7703,I absolutely love this sweater it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights a great staple,1
7704,The cut of this dress is what drew me to order it but it is so much more first the fabric is more of a raw silk which is more like a soft linen than silk its also got a very soft lining that feels great on the skin and it has pockets love a dress with pockets i also love that the design is on the front and back i am lbs and a c and ordered a size its a little big on the sides so i probably shouldve returned it for a but it wasnt big enough to make it annoying o,1
7705,So i recommend wearing with something more fitted or with a flare jeans or tucked in like the picture i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar inside so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit you see hte contrastit is a bit short and i am petite i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise it may have been too shortcolors are nice and i love the material it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm my orffice is freezing should ahve grabbed it,1
7706,Just had to review this dress because it is so beautiful the fabric is light and soft and is really perfect for this flowy tiered design the colors are really pretty not too bright and it fit perfectly i would say that it is much more dressy than it appeared in photos the bodice has some beading and it was much longer on me than on the model though still a perfect maxi length it would be perfect to wear to a wedding or formal affair,1
7707,This dress makes me looks curvythin and sexy i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style this one was a winner i bought others but this one was my favorite im dd sz fit perfect the picture online does not do it justice you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself it looks like an average dress on the model if you have curves youll love this dress,1
7708,These pants are soft fun print and comfy they are a drop crotch but the cut is flattering without bunching up between legs they are perfect for pjs all day type day,1
7709,Just got these jeans last week love the quality which is typical of pilcro jeans i usually have to get a tall size being however they sold out quickly so i decided to order the regular inseam in my usual size they fit great since they are more of a boyfriend jean they dont fit too snug so im able to get away with the regular inseam im usually a tall and the regular works love the cuffs and rise in the jeans ive worn with booties heelsand am waiting for warm w,1
7710,Ive had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn this vest is another fantastic purchase the colorfit match the photos the material is so soft ive worn it quite a bit since i received it and it hasnt pilled its washed well too the braided part can be folded down if you dont want it higher on your neck it will still lay flat drape nicely its perfect for cold weather id love to see this come out in other colors too,1
7711,This top is beauitiful gorgeous detailing with the eyelet lace black flower appliqus silver beads and tiny rose gold sequins down the front true to size im lbs b and took my usual size the slits do come up a bit far on the sides like another reviewer noted but not really enough to be a problem i didnt find it necessary to get the petite size in this top i was going to wait until further markdown since the top is still pricey even with a discount but couldnt resist,1
7712,I would not have spent this much on a dress without a gift card but it absolutely lives up to the hype,1
7713,I recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan that ive had for years was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail this cardigan fit the bill with a perfect fit and lovely texture making it not just your average sweater to go with my style cant say anything bad about it,1
7714,Cute design and interesting back feature runs a little big and is comfortable and flowy,1
7715,Im always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone this looks cute on the model but when i received it its actually very flowing i wanted more of a straight cut doesnt work very well on my body im lbs d its going back,0
7716,This sweater is very nicely madei got a lot of compliments the first time i wore it its a light sweater and looks great with jeans love it,1
7717,I love the details of this top the pleats and ruffles are so pretty and the fit is flattering especially if you have a tummy the arm holes arent gaping like so many tops so you dont even need a cami underneath to hide your bra it is a bit on the larger side i often wear a large but i got a medium and i may have even been able to get away with a small,1
7718,Just a little scallop makes this top special if your on the edge of a i suggest sizing up fabric crispwell made and worth full price,1
7719,I absolutely adore this top it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier skinny pants i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it worth every penny i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it,1
7720,Gorgeous dress with a slimming pattern and flattering waistband i would say the bust cups are a little floppy on the medium petite and i have dds like others i wish the skirt was lined but its not a deal breaker tracy reese did a great job creating movement in the skirt and flounce without the bulk i can wear a little heel but wearing flats makes the hem drag,1
7721,The reason for the title above is this skirt doesnt wow me i felt like i could find this anywhere and i dont go to retailer for such things they have definitely mainstreamed more and more over the yearspros tts i tried on a large and im normally either a or and it fit well and hung well on my hourglass and wider hips without billowing out flows nicely it does have a great movement to it a good everyday skirt not sheer at all it is lined when y,0
7722,I love this dress so muchwhat an excellent purchase i wear this with white leggins and love the look this dress has a sheath underneath the flower pattern that is form fitting which i think is way sexy from the back the front part of the dress is very flowy and moves nicely i love the high neck on this piece and the beautiful colors a wonderful pick up from retailer,1
7723,This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess falls in the right area and absolutely adorable the dress is very fragile handle with care,1
7724,Buy this skit its everything that retailer used to be great pice work appopriate and it fits great,1
7725,Just loved it at first sight and waited for it to come on sale i am usually a size or xsmall but this one fits perfectly with a size i am about lbs and ft and this size fits really well petite is too short esp on the arms the lining is really nice as well the design and the cut of this coat is really flattering unlike some of the boxy designs absolutely divine just loved it,1
7726,Lovely airy fabric and colors true to the pictures online i am and lb i ordered a regular s and it fits fine yes it is midi length coming to about below my knee i would have preferred the length if it had been available but it was not still i will compensate by wearing higher heels the embroidered embellishment along the neck and sides stands out more than in the pic and really makes this dress special the cutaway shoulders give it sophistication if you want to a,1
7727,Love these jeans comfortable fit doesnt stretch out too much after wearing a few hours goes with dress up lazy day or casual tops my goto jeans wish they came in different washes,1
7728,I have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair and i get nonstop compliments on them they are very flattering and drape beautifully the fabric is also complete nofuss and nofade this time i went for the red pair and i love them they really go with the current upscale s vibe they have the s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage s clothes,1
7729,The embroidery across the top is quite lovely the softness and light weighted fabric was ideal for the summer months making this purchase on sale was such a bonus,1
7730,Perfect very pretty and flattering without being too fussy helps to hide my tummy and very well made that said i have fairly wide shoulders and a larger ribcage so i had to size up considerably usually a or a and i needed a to be comfortable the went on but the fabric has no give so i sized up i am never a but thats what worked in this blouse surprisingly it still looked nice and tailored definately runs on the smaller sidelovely worth the full price in my opinion,1
7731,Based on other reviews i ordered these trousers in my regular size dark grey and up one size black motif the size fit perfectly and the size are too big returning i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced but size in this brand fits regardless of style i also prefer the solid grey but that is just a personal choice i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms,1
7732,I recently purchased this dress at my local retailer when it was percent on sale i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it its comfortable elegant and very chic i will make this my goto dress from now on,1
7733,While this is cozy and well made the problem lies with the unavoidable exposure of the inside of the poncho which looks unfinished had the inside been lined or had the hue of the stripes continued through the material the draped look of this piece would be gorgeous unfortunately the faded backside of the pattern a glimpse of it under models left hand viewable through the very large arm holes and impossible to hide disrupts the effortless fluid feel that a poncho should have i was,0
7734,Regarding the product high quality materials and overall make extremely comfortable and flattering cut id love this in all the colors of the rainbow,1
7735,Its a beautiful top but not for bigger busts ordered an xl and the top part would not button i recommend for those with smaller busts,0
7736,Very cute jumpsuit especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs the pattern is striking and bold but not garish it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath i did even though it has padding for those who want to go braless i purchased a p and it fit my lbs frame perfectly i would highly recommend,1
7737,I bought this skirt a month or so ago and only wore it for the first time yesterday i thought the design was fluid summer appropriate and easy like sunday morning i enjoyed wearing it so much that i went on to the retailer site today to order it in another color and lo and behold i saw all the reviews on the sizingfit i totally respect other reviewers so i questioned why that had not been my experience when i wore it yesterday so much so that i went and put it on again sans issuesi am n,1
7738,I fell in love with this online and im so thrilled that its even more beautiful in person it is a stunning very dark teal velvet with the most gorgeous embroidery perfect fit quality and nicely lined a keeper for years to come i think its true to size for reference im lbs and the p fits perfectly,1
7739,Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail its just what i was looking for for my staple summer dress i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top and even can pair just the sweater top with my highwaisted shorts,1
7740,I love this dress its adorable and great for summer with a unique style its a bit unusual with the high and slightly ruffled neck it can easily be dressed up or worn more casually this is the most flattering dress ive found this season particularly around the stomach area im and took a petite size which fit perfectly this dress is a bit translucent so skintoned undergarments are a must,1
7741,I wanted to love this was so excited when i ordered it online the fabric blue and white was beautiful but the cut was bad it fit me like a maternity top and made me look like i was months along i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back in the back because it does not lay flat like that in front it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out returning,0
7742,Admittedly i ignored this dress on a few trips to my local retailer and then it went on sale practically begging me to give it attention i tried it on and fell in love so feminine light and comfortable it has a sort of romanboho goddess vibe due to the billowy top especially in the lighter greige with some seahued accessories added but not so much it feels like cosplay or something i have a full bust dd and didnt find this dress to be unflattering after wearing it to a party i ac,1
7743,I love the elbow patches on this shirt i ordered the wine color and its dark enough to almost be a neutral ive worn it with many things already my only complaint is that the sleeves are super long typically long sleeved shirts are too short for me so im guessing this one would be ridiculously long on someone with short arms,1
7744,Love this shirt looks great with a pair of black work slacks or with jeans very flattering with the banded hem and the material is soft,1
7745,Saw this online and thought it would be perfect for my upcoming plane ride originally ordered the teal color but when it arrived i was disappointed that it was more of a muddy greenish teal and not the light bluish teal like in the photo exchanged it for the black version and i couldnt be happier the black goes well with everythinglooks great with jeans and yoga pants love it,1
7746,I ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week and this is by far my favorite purchase the detail is gorgeous its very soft and figure flattering,1
7747,Im wearing lots of these long cardigans right now this one is comfortable but holds up well the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute but doesnt get in the way its great for casual or casual work wear,1
7748,I am very long waisted generally a size or med but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride upand this brand has run small in the pasti am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare length and widtheither way this is a keeperit is adorable on comfortable my tback bra works perfectly very flattering and way better than expectedthe shorts length is a little longer than pictured but there is an elastic waist with a cami under an,1
7749,I didnt think id like this due to the high neck but i was in the store and it was so soft that i tried it on in the black motif this dress is so comfortable and flattering its definitely a versatile piece dress down with a denim jacket or dress up with heels and it has pockets,1
7750,Based on the reviews of others i ordered this dress a size larger than i usually wear and it fits perfect i am an so i got this in a this is the perfect casual dress for pretty much anytime of the year can be worn with sandals in the spring and summer or boots in the winter,1
7751,I love vests and this is a great one warm and cute because it is sweater material some of the threads look like than can pull but i still think its stylish and different and still a classic to have,1
7752,The suit is lovely but it is very long in the torso and gaps at the leg i was told that it runs small and to size up to a i did but i do not think the smaller one would have done better the bust is fake and it turns out when untied worst of all it emphasizes the tummy all in all not a good look for me i am not heavy but i do need tummy support normally i wear an and in garnet hill a sorry but it went back i really wanted to like it,0
7753,Received these as a christmas gift from my daughter just wonderful warm and cozy and cute size m is just a tad baggy im sure i could have worn small but no matter i wear these often and love them such a treat,1
7754,This tee is such a staple for me i bought it in the green and it is such an elegant deep emerald the perfect shade the shirt has some detail that is not shown there is stitchingseaming along the side in the front and back that give the shirt a good structure the shirt also has a great weight to it the knit is sort of a vertically ribbed knit but thicker than a classic ribbed tank top the edges of the material are also open almostfrayed edges the additional detail on this shirt defini,1
7755,The fabric is great the design is fun i thought the dress would be perfect for work and also wear for a fun night out the fit was perfect up top but the bottom part was to full and a lot longer then i expected so i had to return it,0
7756,I picked this top hoping that it would go with the dipped horizon skirt and the color was a perfect match i love the irregularities in the dye and the woven back the cut is boxy but the fabric is soft and drapes well so very flattering looks great with white jeans,1
7757,Im very pleased with this jacket ive never owned a vegan leather anything so i didnt know if it would show up cheap looking or smelly but to my surprise it didnt have a smell or that shiny cheap look im so glad i headed the other reviewers advise and i sized up my typical size would have been to tight and short im excited to wear this with dresses and jeans this fall i bought the honey color and its more like a cross between beige and blusha slight dusty pink hue i love,1
7758,Super cute and comfy perfect for fall and winter apre ski great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots,1
7759,I have never tried this brand before and was pleasantly surprised at the fit i especially like the button detail as it makes them a little more dressy and different i plan to wear with a simple white tank and sandals i will definitely look for this brand again,1
7760,This coat is wonderful i am usually an xss in retailer and i got the xs it is supposed to be a bit large goes with everything and great quality,1
7761,This bra is very cute and pretty comfortable i usually wear between a d in elle mcpherson and this fit perfect i got it in black and while its really cute i was surprised how different the color looked in person vs online online it looked to me to have some purple to it but it is definitely black in person just an fyi i also thought the tassel was cute but it does look a little cheap and flimsy in person still a great bra,1
7762,Love this sweater warm cozy and and not ordinary fits great too no surprises,1
7763,My favorite pants casual and a bit dressier by changing my top comfortable classic well made,1
7764,This dress set my heart aflutter but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing i literally ordered six different sizes and when i put them on they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist then it would look like the model does i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the modelso i played around with it and ended up putting in small darts in the front and v,1
7765,I have been unable to find a jumpsuit that looks good likely due to my long torso this is the first one that doesnt make me look like i am a tall fiveyearold easy to dress it up with a statement necklace and fits perfectly i am pds and bought my normal xs highly recommend especially with the current extra off promotion,1
7766,I love this dress the print is beautiful the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique im short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses dont work on me this is an exceptioni ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me which i think i like more than if it were a midithe armholes do cut in i wasnt sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closermy husband chuckled that its a little mrs roper i dont care im wea,1
7767,This is a really cute dress just did not look flattering on me at all i suppose i could have gone down a size however i just did not love it i am athletic build dd i read the other reviews and everyone loves this dress here is what i did not like there are pockets which i cannot figure out the purpose that lay oddly all bunched up right at the hips due to the shape of the dress it bunches out on my short frame it made me look shorter and wider the fabric is a lightwei,0
7768,These shorts are super soft and comfortable i am normally a size or a in shorts i got a size in these shorts and they are still large i exchanged them for a and they fit perfectly so these run sizes large other than sizing these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional,1
7769,I really cant say enough about them they have the perfect amount of stretch are so comfortable and they keep their shape really well i would say that you could wear them times before washing also the color is perfect they are tts and even allow for a little extra holiday weight without becoming a torture device,1
7770,In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l which i did the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial all in all a great purchase,1
7771,The colors including the deep blue in the background are as vibrant and harmonious in person as you would hope it looks like an oil pastel drawing the print itself is very well done im so picky about the quality and resolution but even up close every part is beautiful the cut is great it doesnt show too much of the armpit the straps and sides cover a normal bra and the neckline just shows the collarbonesthe feel is very light and floaty some sites mislabel the material but t,1
7772,I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here i think it will look great over denim grey or olive green dresses and shirts,1

7776,I really loved this skirt on the model but it just wasnt flattering when i received my order i ordered two sizes and i am athletic build and the front closure made my waist look much larger than it is the back of the skirt also flared out more than i expected it to sadly i had to return both perhaps this would look better on someone with a much taller frame,0
7777,So great soft and a great sweater but still gives you a shape to your body,1
7778,Love love this top it is soft comfortable and cute it is versatile eg i can dress up for work or dress down by throwing on a pair of jeans the tie at the neck adds a cute detail if you want it tied great staple for the wardrobe i purchased in the black and it is very versatile not sure how i feel about the print,1
7779,Received this shirt yesterday and loved it doesnt look that great online in pics but it is a unique and beautiful top the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape i am and lbs and a small bust size a i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didnt want it to tight around my butt i am curvy in that area size pantsi ordered the medium and i am so glad i did it lifts just like on the modelthe only downfall,1
7780,I wasnt sure about this top but i had a feeling i needed to at least try it on it drapes so beautifully and the keyhole neck is a lovely little touch i love the asymmetric hemline and the fabric is incredibly soft as far as the fit goes i found that it did run slightly small,1
7781,The fabric of this top is lovely the fit not so it does not fit as shown on the model the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a swing top i am slim build i ordered my usual size medium shoulders and back fit perfectly too much material around the middle had it had a straight cut to it as shown id keep it because it doesnt its going back,0
7782,Very soft and comfortable great for girls who dont usually like shorts because of biggermuscular thighs i would say these run large but not drastically for reference im usually a size on the bottom and i got a small the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house,1
7783,This top is gorgeous and better than the web photo i love that it goes with the offtheshoulder trend while allowing for a normal bra in fact it even has the little snaps at the shoulders to hold your straps in place awesome detail the ruffled portion looks good over or under your arms length hit at about my hip with long torso lbs b and and it has an overall flowy but not sacklike fit i found this to fit tts bought my usual s beautiful vivid print looks great with wh,1

7785,I have been on the fence about this blouse until i went into the store and tried it on instant love for methe fabric is not sheeryeah the shoulders are cut in so you may need a halter bra i typically go between a or but found the cut at a a line so there is a nice flow but not overly so so purchased the the colors will go with anything for many seasons love the quality,1

7812,I love this top shows off the shoulders but a normal bra works no tank needed not too boxy looking all these things i have had a problem in some of the currant tops an retailer i felt it was flattering and comfortable with some country chic i found the colors to be a bit more rich than online there was a tiny bit of puffy fabric around the back upper shoulder but nothing to worry about the neckline is a stretchy and close fitting and thats the part of the top that i dont usually wear i,1

7824,After reading the reviews about this top being really clingy i decided to order up a size and purchased a medium when i took it out of the box today and held it up it looked huge and i thought i had made a mistake however when i tried it on it actually fit really well i could see if i had ordered my usual small how it would have clinged to my body in a unflattering way very happy with the top and thankful for the reviews,1
7825,This blouse was just right for me and in my late fifties not too frilly so still age appropriate yet feminine and fun i have largish arms from working out and the sleeves fit with give and at this stage of life the boxy look that falls just below the waist is flattering i took a regular im usually a medium r or mpetite and the fit was comfortable and right both colors are unusual and it works nicely with pants and skirts,1
7826,This dress ran largemaybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body maybe because i have a short torsopetite frame i loved the yellow color for summerit would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding unfortunately i had to return it,0
7827,Made by dawn suits are the bomb the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky but not thong territory just enough side leg to be seriously sexy the quality is fantastic soft with nude lining love the retro feel to the high neck top enough support even for my ds so comfy i forgot i was wearing it at lunch the normal triangle tops cut into my shouldersneck and this style does not amazing quality and well worth the pricefyi large top fit perfectly but i needed a medium bottom,1
7828,Great very flattering bohemian dress and its silk,1

7830,I bought the grey version of this shirt instore because of the cute pattern soft material and versatility of wear you can dress it up for work or wear with jeansshorts for a more casual look the beautiful purples greens and blues of the roses look like a water color painting and stand out against the grey background ive already received multiple complements from coworkers and friends and liked it so much myself i bought the other two colors personally i think it runs a bit large s,1
7831,When i saw this top online i loved it and in person i love it even more so perfect for springsummer and i can see it even transitioning into fall the sizing is perfect i am a size l in tops and the size i ordered is just right its loose but not too loose or frumpy looking the fabric is slightly thin but thats perfect for the summer but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when its cooler the only thing is if you a little busty the neckline might dip a tiny bit,1
7832,I bought this top in the store and love it i was surprised to see negative reviews online i am small chested curvier on the bottom this top does have a wide and short fit but the cut is flattering all three colors are beautiful i wear it with high waist short jean shorts and it looks very fresh,1
7833,This is m frist pair of flares and i love themmake my legs look miles long and theyre also my most comfortable jeans im and around lbs with narrow hipsthe fits perfectly ive worn them with inch heels and the jeans dust the floor longer than on the model but i like that look if i wanted to wear them with flats theyd need to be hemmed but i prefer heels anyway iive avoided highrise jeans out of fear theyd look matronly but combined with the flare the high waist is,1
7834,Nice tee true red sleeves lacing is a nice touch good quality and great sale price,1
7835,This top is so pretty in person it bells out at the bottom just the right amount,1
7836,The fabric is very soft love the purple floral color the top is very flattering with the ease and comfort of a tshirt,1
7837,First the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer i really wanted to like this top but the fitting is so awkward for me i typically where a xs and sized up in the shirt to a size it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest size a i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow need a strapless bra and made it look unflattering overall had to return this one back to the store,0
7838,Saw this in the store looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale got it this weekend with the off and love it thanks retailer wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments as someone else noted it does catch on itself so take care when wearing also the slits on the side are semihigh but as my husband noted this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic i went with an for this reasonyou could also wear a tank underneath and yes even on sale,1
7839,I love this skirt i wasnt sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too the quality is great the skirt is a fine silk ant it is lined so you dont need a slip i think it fits perfectly for my body type and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway i am normally a petite waist hips,1
7840,I bought this top in the store which was good because i ended up wearing a size smaller than i usually do i loved the flowy fit of it the washing instructions say machine wash cold tumble dry low i washed it on cold and hung it to dry it shrank to the point of being unwearable the dreaded button gap and lost its softness i hope the store lets me return it,0
7841,The dress is very beautiful and looks expensive it will make a nice wedding dress it does run quite small though i am and lbs with a straight figure but the p was too constricting,1
7842,This dress has a beautiful fit eyed it for awhilesnatched it up at the dress sale only drawback was the edging around the neck on some the creampatterned fabric was used and it was distracting hunted around at stores but ended up getting lucky with online purchase,1
7843,These are fabulous leggings for cold days i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm love them and i highly recommend only con is that they are about of an inch shorter than i would like,1
7844,This dress is very well made and the fabric hangs beautifully i weigh and usually wear a small but sized up to medium for a longer sleeve and hem the print fabric and style make it appropriate for daytime or evening it should transition nicely to fall and will look great with boots,1
7845,The girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh ive been thinking maybe i shld try them out i ordered these online in the size as i am usually a in skinnys i am a little hard to please or say hard to fit in skinny jeans i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if its uncomfortable paying full price it is expected for the look fit to be perfect even if on sale i wont go it if i think something is not right for me at slender legs skinnys are either,1
7846,Wow this dress is so incredibly designed and made the style is a subtle showstopper classic and beautiful like they dont make anymorethe inside of the dress is so well constructed it has its own beautyi read that it ran a little large so i tried the and the since i usually wear a well the looked like a lingerie commercial with the dress unable to zip above the waist the fit and zipped but i could not sit down comfortably yikesthe was a winner im,1
7847,Very disappointed runs small in chest and too long the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail i dont think this dress is worth the price it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze i have been in the fashion industry for over years and this is a miss mark in my opinion put it back on the rack and save your for something better at sweet retailer,0
7848,Very nice quality awesome style the fabrics is so soft but very durable this top will be great with jeans or a denim skirt,1
7849,So pretty love hte design on this onei tried on hte regualr size adn will not need a petite it hit me jsut above my knee younger gals may oprefer shorter howeverthe aottern is also nice the cut is flowy and flattering nothing bad to say about htis dress,1
7850,Totally love this shirt as a basic with fun details super soft great quality fabric and the cutouts add the perfect bit of interest can see this accessorizing well and looking good with jeans or skirts really happy with it fits loose but tts,1
7851,These legging are adorable i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome the buttons at the ankle are cute i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i dont like to spend so much on leggings,1
7852,This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft i wouldnt describe it as chunky or bulky though its probably made of at least or maybe even ply cashmere the sleeves do run slightly short i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly grab it while you can its so luxurious super warm for the winter,1
7853,This dress is very thick cotton material like a sweatshirt i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric,0
7854,Love this unbasic white top its very flattering on and i love that its a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion i am usually a size in maeve topsdresses but i found a size fit me a bit better in this particular top if youre in between sizes you may need to size down i definitely recommend this top,1
7855,I had been waiting for this dress to go on sale and when it did it was only available in a petite xs the only reason i said it ran big is because it was a petite and i usually wear a regular i am size the length is perfect and i have really narrow shoulders so the petite fit perfect the details on this dress are just beautiful and extremely comfortable,1
7856,I too was immediately drawn to this dress online and was this close to ordering a petite when i stopped my my local retailer and they had just gotten it in in regular only of course i tried it on in the xs regular and was thrilled to find it fit perfectly and was so flattering on my hourglass figure im and with a dd chest no gaping or pulling the waist and shoulders were where they should be and i found the length with the hilo hem to be just above my knees in front i think,1
7857,The tunic is very pretty when i visited antho store i was just fallen in love with it i purchased purple one because the color is for fall this is good for straight and slender body typeplease purchase it before it is gone,1
7858,I purchased this dress for a baby shower and it was just perfect i am and pounds and ordered the petite xs which fit great the dress is supposed to be a tad oversized and flowy so this size worked out great for me it will also be a nice transition piece into spring with a pair of black fringe booties overall i recommend this dress,1
7859,I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress twice helped by sale price with additional percent off promo its mainly the irresistible print i bought it in both the lovely bluepink floral and the patterned red love it works best when the weather is in upper s with tights and boots but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders so dont size down i do wish the fabric was not,1
7860,These jeans run true to size very comfy and i love the frayed bottoms,1
7861,So soft a casual tunic yet polished and interesting enough for work darker blue than the photo and the colors are much brighter and prettier in person,1
7862,Perfection i am and the size fit me like a glove beautiful color too highly recommend,1
7863,I love everything bordeaux so when i saw this one i knew i needed to try it and its my favorite top from this brand ever i hope they keep the style and offer it in all of the colors going forward its a very flattering style for anyone accentuates shape without being tight or clingy and the stripes are lovely also the material is so soft i have not washed it yet so i hope it stands up to wash and wear well overall this is an amazing top it runs slightly large im usually an xs in tops,1
7864,I wanted to love this tunic sweater the material is so soft and a perfect weight the color is pretty bu the fit absolutely did not work for me the tunic runs very small a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small the slits are quite high i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back,0
7865,My favorite pair of ags i normally wear sz but i have awkward proportions when it comes to finding jeans that are actually ankle length on me i orders these in a petite and went a size up to be safe it doesnt seem like theyve stretch out any and they fit exactly how i want i love the dark wash bc they can be both dressed up and down,1
7866,Love this shirt its perfect its so perfect that i bought two it is boxy but it has a lovely drape please note the heart is navy blue and not so black as shown its a thin shirt and i know it wont last a super long time hence the back up,1
7867,Love this top its very comfortable and flatters my midsection versatile piece,1
7868,This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long but that was an easy fix,1
7869,I just received this in the mail today and i love it its adorable very flattering and hides all the spots youd want hidden i dont find that this runs too large i ordered my usual size large and it fits tts its not meant to fit snug i ordered this in the navy color beautiful and flattering,1
7870,I wanted this sweater to work but sadly it failed first the pink was way to sheer for my liking the sheerness caused a weird color overlap on the stomach area then the band at the bottom was too tight causing a weird ballooning affect a shirt underneath could work but it takes away from the beauty of the knit the soft pink is gorgeous but not good for medium to light skinned folks,0
7871,Was hesitant to order it as first since i was worried it might be a little too boxy in person glad i tried it since that turned out not to be the case drapes nicely exactly like in the picture and can be worn either on its own or layered with a cardiganshrug loose fit means i can wear it to work too am usually between a small and xs but the xs fit me well also wanted to mention this hits me right under the waist and im ft so there is a chance it could be a little too short for someon,1
7872,I ordered a ml in this vest and it fits perfectly thirst is cozy and stylish in fact i ordered the same vest in another color its versatile enough to wear with both skirts and jeans i also think its a timeless piece that will stay in style for years to come,1
7873,I love wearing my boatneck pullover the unique part of this item is the back with buttons the shirts appears to be inside out however its not its soft comfortable stylish and warm i really like how its longer in the back,1
7874,I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected im lbs the material wears like a tee so its comfortable but the front details give it a special look this is going to be on my goto list all summer,1
7875,The dress is just ok i cannot imagine having paid full price for this i got it for florida vacation i put it on to wear to church first and spilled a drop of lavender oil on it and it stained cant get it out thats punk for a dress that even on sale is like sending back,0
7876,I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it not only was it too long but there was also a hole in it so i returned it when a small petite became available i ordered it thinking it would fit better i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well both skirts also looked as if they had been worn there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or its really bad quality,0
7877,This dress is super cute and sexy i bought the taupe in a size medium for reference im tall and weigh about i dont know how tall the last reviewer is but this was not too short in the front for me i really like it,1
7878,A perfectly fun pant for a gray or sunny winter day i like the longer length to the ankle on me pairing with my kate spade black sabina combat boots and a eileen fisher black cashmere boxy cropped sweater another fun option is to pull out the pink accent in the pant with a pink camisole under a black sweater the fabric weight is good for winter they do feel a little itchy at first but its not noticeable after wearing them a short while,1
7879,This is a great dress that can be dressed up or worn with flip flops i also love that it has pockets,1
7880,These are my favorite pair of caprisankle jeans ever im lbs and got the petite in gray the fit is fantastic and the length is perfect for summer days couple inches above my ankles the gray color is so versatile and i can dress it up or down i plan on getting it in other colors as well since the fit is so good,1
7881,I love this top the picture does not show all the beautiful detail i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it stunning,1
7882,I love this dress so simple yet beautiful very excited to wear this spring and summer perfect for easter,1
7883,I ordered the medium my usual size for flowing tops it fits nicely looks amazing from the front and looks slimming then i turned to the side and oh mymy boobs protruded like two big balloons i looked like wonder woman there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasnt the size just the cut i do have gs but what the heck the color is glorious but it has to go back,1
7884,I love quirky and unique sweaters cardigans and this is no exception its not obvious in the photo at least it wasnt for me but the cardigan does have buttons all the way down and not just at the top something i appreciated those buttons however are not easy to unbutton the snails are adorable without being childish im lbs often between a small and medium when it comes to cardigans i chose the medium for this one which fit exactly how i wanted it to aka sleeves were,1
7885,Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try love its the perfect cozy cute sweater color is beautiful and fit is great i am lbs and i tried both the small and extra small i went with the xs for a more flattering fit i love it,1
7886,I found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing its lined and tts i usually wear a size and this fit well some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good inches in length im and and it hit me just above the knee i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have,1
7887,This dress is amazing the colors in person are so vibrant and yet organic somehow at the same time perhaps this is because the fabric has a really nice depth and texture to it i got this dress for a summer wedding and its casual yet dressy at the same time re fit the best thing about this dress is a fit its so incredibly flattering on it fits like a glove it just hugs your figure in the most flattering way especially if you have an hourglass figure the fit is true to size,1
7888,I first saw this shirt online and decided to see it in person so happy i did i never would have picked it up in the store it looks much better on than on the hanger it is so flattering you can wear it on or off the shoulders and although it is a boxy shirt it somehow makes you look slim wow i took my usual medium highly recommend,1
7889,This dress caught my eye because i dont have anything like it i wear between a m l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust i usually wear a in slacks and in tops i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric it is durable while still looking elegant i also like that it is in navy and not black it is also nicely lined i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress,1
7890,I bought this dress to wear for our upcoming family pictures i dont think the image does the dress justice the fit is so flattering and slimming i feel like it can easily be dressed down too with a cute jacket in either denim or leather the material is thinner and it does wrinkle a bit the price tag is a tad high also for a thin maxi dress but i just had to have it,1
7891,Love this top the contrasting laceeyelet is pretty and interesting it flairs in a flattering way,1
7892,I have to disagree with some previous reviews i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart they look absolutely adorable with booties flats wedges heels anything and theyre extremely comfortable and flattering as most pilcros tend to be i got my usual size and the rise and fit is great i think maybe they stretch out a bit ive only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose but overall great and a good price at least co,1
7893,This one is perfect for the taller ladies or those looking for a longer fit i was a little discouraged by a few shortfitting tops recently and this one finally works for me at with a long torso awesome quality not overly delicate and beautiful detail,1
7894,I fell in love with dress immediately it runs small but is very flattering even if you have a little you want to hide i went up size so comfy and beautiful love,1
7895,I have always had a thing for velvet and velvet pants are hard to come by so i was so pleased to see these and i rushed to order a pair in the dark turquoise they are beautiful exactly as pictured but a bit longer in length on me i am they can be dressed up but what is so fun about them is that they can easily be dressed down as well i am wearing them with a heathergrey tshirt they also pair well with the metallic linen tees my one and only criticism is that they are a bit wide,1
7896,Not being into bright neon colors i love this top the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy its super cute and very flattering,1
7897,This vest is adorable i love the color it goes well with almost anything the drawstrings work great some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look honestly i wear it at least once a week out with friends or even to my job as a nanny i was a little worried about the length of it because im tall but it works perfectly with my build,1
7898,I bought this today in a size fits perfect i am normally a or or xs the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested because it is not long in the front i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape it is on the shorter side very nice material and design as well as details overall good pick,1
7899,Just lovely gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer,1
7900,Very pleased with the fabric and design of this it is thick but not heavy and the cutouts in front fall so that you dont really have to wear anything underneath there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i didnt initially notice but wasnt really a problem im b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest i couldnt wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up its also a bit shorter than i th,1
7901,This top is so pretty i purchased the peach color it does run large so you will need to size down you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer it will look great with jeans white jeans shorts dress it up or down its not suppose to fit tight love it,1
7902,I just received this dress and tried it on its a nice dress that is flattering but the material was much heavier that i expected it to be its way to heavy to wear in the florida heat so unfortunately its going back,1
7903,I am very surprised by the low reviews of this dress this dress is obviously a very loose fitting style it is a bit of a man repellar dressthe quality of the fabric is beautiful and the pattern stunning i find the loose flowy style liberating and comfortable i love it with otk boots and tights for winter but also planning to wear with sandals in spring i am lbs and purchased the petite small,1
7904,I bought this in navy it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on super flattering and i dont even need to wear a bra with it,1
7905,Mutliple layers of buttery softness i bought the blue and its true to size it is soo soft i could wear this to sleep it drapes beautifully highly recommend it now i want to buy all the colors,1
7906,This is a lovely pencil skirt that is wellmade and really brightens a work day like a lot skirts with multiple colors a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact,1
7907,Purchased this fun feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day the peplum style isnt typically something i gravitate to but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer length sleeves i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans oxfords a cute hat for how beautiful this top is i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal,1
7908,Im always thrilled to find a piece like this at retailer just received my dress and couldnt be happier beautifully made and fits absolutely perfectly im lbs and am very comfortable in the small with a little breathing room length is perfect with heels planning to wear it with sandals to a birthday party this month and then into fall and winter with boots and a top layer if youre hesitating go for it,1
7909,This item is pretty the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents my issue with it is its very impractical the fabric is extremely thin and you wouldnt want to wear it in any weather below degrees its ridiculous to advertise this product for a fallwinter season the tube top underneath doesnt work very hard to stay up and isnt a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit why wouldnt they just stitch a lining,0
7910,Beautiful color and flattering fit on me i bought the size and it fits my lb frame perfectly i love that it has sleeves no worries about upper arms it is light and silky even though it is not made of silk it is elegant and casual at the same time thus versatile i will wear it to three different weddings this summer and can make it work for the office too love it worth every penny,1
7911,I absolutely love this sweater very comfortable and flattering im thinking of buying it in another color,1
7912,I got the offwhite lace top and love it quality is great for the price comfortable and the lace isnt super delicate so it seems like it should last,1
7913,Love this top fits perfectly its lovely,1
7914,Love these pants super comfy and casual i found they run true to size and are just lose enough to feel casual not sloppy my only complaint the cuffs of the jeans were thoroughly covered in some kind of animal hair very disgusting but love the jeans,1
7915,I bought this in my usual size small and love it looks great with skinnies or pencil skirts not sheer enough to need a cami but enough to look cottony and breezy very elegant it falls flatteringly on my shape c it has an elegant arty vibe if you have a long torso or big chest i would say try it on in the store to make sure the chest area falls well for you,1
7916,I was surprised at how much i liked this sweater i was watching it for awhile and when it went on sale i decided to give it a try i couldnt decided on the rose or black so i ordered both since they were such a good price figuring i would return the color i didnt want boy was i happy i ordered both the rose is very flattering and the fit is so much better than i expected i am and usually take a large in size i could have gone down one size but the front drapes against your body it,1
7917,This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days it fits tts well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail sure to sell out,1
7918,I dont normally write reviews but i purchased this dress in white in different sizes and each dress had the same flaw the hems were very uneven on all three this dress was poorly sewn its a shame because it looked awesome online i was very disappointed,0
7919,I purchased all the colors of this wonderful tee after receiving the first its machine wash and dry and theyve all held up well through multiple washes so far the neckline and fit is flattering for a larger bust due to the ribbing but would be great on a more athletic figure as well the fabric is soft enough that the sleeves dont bug me like some other tops do all the colors are great and youll want more than one true to size,1
7920,Everything about this dress is exceptional the fit material workmanship and style are wonderful the dress even has petticoats to make the skirt stand out the dress is modern in style yet classic,1
7921,I ordered this and thought it would be cute for work but it tuns out the sleeves are ridiculously long i am foot and do not have short arms also it is a bit short waisted for me i do love the floral detail of the button,0
7922,I wore this dress yesterday and was complemented wherever i went and asked where i purchased the dress i love the linen and the back of the dress is so flattering i ordered a medium and could have gone with a small which i usually never wear so i would order a size smaller,1
7923,Love this sweater i almost passed it up online because i didnt notice the snails the sweater is navy and the snails are black they are so cute and such a fun and unique little accent the material is a moderate to lightweight sweater the length was perfect i have inadvertently purchased a bunch of cropped sweaters this year this one is not cropped yay the sleeves are actually a bit on the long side i sized up a little with the idea of wearing it over long sleeved tops i am typica,1
7924,The top i received was large really long in length pockets in the front along the seam and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape the id s matched but thats about it returned,0
7925,I am super happy with this purchase this top is so soft with a nice amount of flow im wearing it with a bolero sweater over it making it wearable in the fall and in cooler weather i also purchased this top in the graygreen shade and it lovely as well,1
7926,I am a jumpsuit convert i tried it on just in case but was amazed at how easy and effortlessly adorable it is i purchased the black petite and love that it is super versatile in terms of seasonality and styling options i have an hourglass figure and the draping and fit of the piece work very well,1
7927,I loved this top when i first saw it online and it did not disappoint when i received it in the mail its very lightweight perfect for spring cool summer night early fall i really like the design and like that you can tuck it in there is enough fabric in the front to give it a flowy look that i appreciate bc i will be giving birth soon and my post baby body will likely need some coverage great top,1

7931,This sweater is beautiful it fitsdrapes nicely is a gorgeous color feels soft and is comfortable to wear im generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium the sleeves are pretty longi have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand but thats all rightthey look fine rolled i highly recommend,1
7932,I kept stalking this cape on the site since it went on a few months ago and finally decided to pull the trigger this is an absolutely gorgeous capeperfect for hourglass figures because of the waistdefining belt its a really modern cut it reminds me of some of the red carpet cape dresses of late its so elegant this is a timeless cut the nude is a gorgeous rich warm brown color if youre really busty you might go up a size to get the girls covered i ordered my usual size m and i may,1

7936,I love this dress the fabric feels amazing is super flattering i am with broad shoulders a d chest and went with the small petite i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders length it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest,1
7937,This dress is gorgeous it looks exactly as it appears on model the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else i am not petite but this petite worked perfect on me for midi lengthpros of dressthe dress has nice light float fabric with colorblind on bottom for a touch of modernthe dress looks very dowton abby and the vintage look is hard to find now days in dressthe dress looks fa,1
7938,The perfect jeans for daytime and bending down with the kids or dressing up later for night i love that the cuff isnt sewn so you can choose to roll them down too with just the right amount of stretch they are extremely flattering they are definitely my new favorite pair this season,1
7939,This dress looks simple but man is it unexpectedly sexy and oh so comfortable the deep v neckline and side slits elevate this from a simple tshirt dress to something else add just the right accessories and this dress transforms i have the xs and its just roomy enough without being clingy and did i say how comfortable it is the fabric is perfectly lightweight without being flimsy and color is a cool saturated denim color i receive compliments every time i wear it love love love,1
7940,Love this romantic girlie girl dress so pretty,1
7941,This shirt is boxy but as the pictures clearly shows that is the design of it if you know how to style outfits its a great buy i really like it im tall and slender so its a bit easier for me to pull this off the design and color are just really neat really cool shirt for the fall,1
7942,Lovely summer top comfortable and cool for hot summer days beautiful fabric fits tts highly recommend,1
7943,These were as great in person as i had hoped great color for fall super comfy and flattering fit happy with my purchase,1
7944,I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale off the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since its baby doll shape but it didnt work for me around the arm holes and mine are not that big i am and lb and size worked perfect,1
7945,Saw this in store and could hardly wait to try it on the print is adorable and colors are vibrant the material is heavier than id like for hot phoenix summers but decided to get it anyway will be great for work i noticed that there is a little more room in the chest area of this dress but not a deal breaker seems to be well made in general and i love the pockets,1
7946,This is one of the best date night tops ive seen in a while im lbs and the xs is perfect the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed but i do that often so i dont see it as a design flaw,1
7947,This wasnt for me i have a short neck and am the length was fine on the one i tried on but other proportions were off it was too big around in the middle yet tighter at the bottom on me this made it resemble a large bag the neckline stood up on mine even when i pushed it down to resemble the picture here with the model it still felt like a whiplash collar coming up over my chin i gave it four stars for quality since the material is so soft,0
7948,I had my eye on this for a while and my store finally got it in in tmie for the off sweaters too bad hte petite size was already sold out by then however good thing isthe xs stil lfit me in a nice way i wil lnever know about petite decided to jsut purchase as is they dont have xxs either the fit is on hte looser comfortable side the red color is rich and the design is subtle adn will nto fall apart so it add some interest to an otherwise typical pullover will look nice with j,1
7949,The shirt looks so much more flattering on the body than on the hanger it has a luxuriously soft feel without compromising fabric quality i purchased both the white and navy color indeed a closet staple,1
7950,This top looks beautiful online when i got it it looks nothing like the pic its wide too much fabric no shape and so unflattering its definitely going back,0
7951,This top is absolutely beautiful i especially love the richness of the black and burgundy one i am typically a size medium but purchased the large because i wanted it to fit a little bigger and longer i was going for more of a tunicstyle if youre broadshouldered like i am you may opt for a bigger size as well because the sleeves can look a little silly if its too small,1
7952,Best jeans ever i have pairs now after getting my first pair last year i knew i would be needing another most comfortable form fitting and flattering jean ever,1
7953,Run to purchase this jacket i am in love it surpassed my wildest expectations when it arrived beautiful coloration comfortable fit fantastic fabric and gorgeous collar i am so glad that i ordered it please use this exact same design and offer this same jacket in other colors and patterns i cant say enough good things about this item,1
7954,Im ft tall and usually wear a size but had to size up to a because this dress runs a bit small around the waist its a beautiful dress it hit me right below the knee so might be long on shorter gals i received many compliments on this dress the colors are beautiful the main color of the dress is a dark navy it looked black online definitely buy this dress its a great work dress and you wont be sorry that you did,1
7955,It is such a cute dress the mulitcolored aspect allows me to wear many different color shoes with it the dress can be formal or informal and it works for a myriad of occasions please purchase it,1
7956,I wore this dress for the first time yesterday i have never received so many compliments on a dress before several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress wasit is an absolute musthave,1
7957,Sometimes i order things online that i can hardly wait to arrive and then once they do i wonder if i made a mistake when ordering it this is one of those times and it was not my mistake the shirt i received is not like this one it is an xs but it is quite large falling inches below where this one hits on the model everyone i have shown the shirt to says that it is a denim blue color not grey at all it is a pretty color but not what i thought i was ordering i hate it when this happens,0
7958,I tried this on in the burgundy color in the store and hoping it goes on sale soon the fabric is not too thin like some of their tops i run the gamut in retailer sizes but lean towards mediums this top fit beautifully in a small it drapes nicely and doesnt hug the body nor is it too flowy looking maternityish i am and dd for reference it looks like it will hold up well and the bit of lace makes it dressy casual if it doesnt go on sale soon i might have to get it anyway b,1
7959,These are amazing so comfortable true to size i usually wear a in pilcro and ag and bought these in a i have curvy thighs and a smaller waist but didnt get a gap situation with these the only issue i have is the length im and wish they were a tiny bit shorter they hit right at the top of my foot so i keep debating if i should cuff them or not since the length looks more flattering cuffed but then the actual cuff looks a little weird i bought them in black for work and now,1
7960,I wasnt sure how the knotted front would look on me but it lays perfectly very comfortable welldesigned flattering top in lovely rich colors im normally a smallmedium in retailer tops but i got the large as it does run small and i dont like things too clingy so best to try on in store rather than buy online nice simple statement piece,1
7961,Super cute plaid top i love the colors they are vibrant and go well with my fair complexion it is a short top and would pair well with high waisted jeans or skirts,1
7962,I just got this skirt in the mail and im absolutely delighted with it id ordered both my normal size and one size up taking a tip from the reviewer whod found it snug but my usual retailer size fit beautifully i do have narrow hips though so maybe its snug on more curvaceous figures the fabric is so soft and supple and ive already tried the skirt with several widely varying shoe styles so i can confirm its versatility it looks feminine with heeled sandals as in the pictur,1
7963,This is the nd time ive purchased a dolan top and returned it bc it was dry clean only both tops were what i consider to be casual tops to be worn with a pair of jeans running errands etc i do not dry clean this kind of casual shirt it is made out of rayon and thats the problem i thinki purchased this in the wine color and it is a lovely color hangs nicely doesnt cling the sleeves are a bit long but i could live with that i just pushed them up as a turtleneck it was a bit l,0
7964,I ordered a size small usually i am ps but wanted the extra length usually i can get away with a regular small but not this time such a cute style but made me look short wide unfortunately its going back,0

7966,Im going to a wedding in dec and looking for something different thats where my retailer comes intheir is this beautiful lace jumpsuit staring me in the face saying im what u r looking for im and the petite size fit perfect love the navy blue color all seti am ready,1

7970,Great fitting longer tee comfortable and light longer short sleeve a nice change from cap sleeves,1
7971,I really wanted this dress to be perfect but the skirt portion flares out in a way that was not flattering the other reviewer is about inches taller than me perhaps it works better on a taller frame,0
7972,I love sanctuary clothing this parka is on the lighter side good for this mild east coast winter it is water repellent the length hits me on my upper thigh and the sleeves are long good for longer limbs i received many compliments,1

7974,Love this dress can be dressed down or up for dresser occasions i did order a petite which i usually dont do but due to the length being so long but the petite is just right hitting a couple inches below the knee im,1
7975,This product was very disappointing fabric was thin it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top so its not flattering at all at its really overpriced for what it is it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape what wouldnt but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs im and not wellendowed a b so it did nothing for mealso the online picture of the moss version looks like its a greyblack combo its not it is really green,0
7976,Cant say enough about these pantsi often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me i also dont love long flowy tops with jeans all the time the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle sectioncue these darlings with out any buttons zippers on the front your shirts will lay flat and crisp i feel comfortable and appropriate at my causal work o,1
7977,This is a comfortable pretty blouse i purchased the neutral print and am very pleased with it,1
7978,Im not sure why they call this black because what you see in this pictures depicted is pretty much the shade in person the fabric itself is lovely it made my wider hips look smaller pros drapes beautifully on the body especially for curvier gals not black but a deep navyvelvet look and feel very forgiving and stretchy perfect length in front and back hides imperfections wonderfully soft flows well and uniquecons material is thin not for winter a,1
7979,Ordered this in my normal size large in taupe the jacket fit tts the length was cropped but just long enough hit just below my belly button to feel comfortable and not too short for my height the quality feels good,1
7980,This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit jumpsuits are always tricky for me but this one fits like a dream i would say it runs true to size with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part thats not typically a problem for me being a d i dont think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais,1
7981,Adorable foxes i was smitten in the store but the fix is bizarre and the foxes dont come up very high so youre limited in the length you can wear i bought the ml based on salesperson advice and i cant imagine trying anything smaller i usually wear a size s or bottom these were super snug back to the store they went,0
7982,I just love the bright yellow floral pattern and the off the shoulder sleeves the loose fit is really ideal for when i just want to throw something on and run out the door but look super cute at the same time it runs a little large to give you the flowy look but i like things flowy so this wasnt an issue for me but a plus,1
7983,These jeans are adorable im so sad they didnt fit my legs are bigger than the rest of my body but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants if you are looking for wide legs these are not the jeans for you,0

7996,Dont get me wrong this is probably cute on someone else but not me i looked in the mirror and just laughed it was that bad so if youre considering getting this size down ordered mine in large and it looks like im wearing a barrel the pink is pretty but the horizontal striping did nothing for my shape the fabric is soft im just over trying peplums,0
7997,I wanted to love this shirt the fit was a little off and i wish it had come in a little at the waist to be more figure flattering before it flared out the fabric is nice but wrinkles easily and in the white is see through sadly i will be returning,0
7998,I love this skirt so much its so comfortable and flattering the button design along the sides is adorable its got a liner inside the skirt that ensures that its not seethrough in anyway its a great buy,1
7999,After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman my regular size small was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me this top definitely has no problem staying off the shoulder since i have broad shoulders it doesnt completely come off me loving the bohochic vibe of this,1
8000,This dress is super cute flattering and well made but it runs very small i am usually a so from other reviews i ordered an and it is still tight in the hip area it zips but the fabric pulls a bit in the front and it rides up when i walk i am going to try and exchange it for a because i think ill get lots of wear out of it,1
8001,I was very hesitant about this i read the previous reviews and thought oh no the first time i saw it in person i was mildly disappointed because the material wasnt how i thought it would be then i saw it up close and i realized it was better than i thought however i didnt have time to try it onit wasnt until later when i saw it on someone else that i realized i was looking at a must have i am so happy i purchased this its beautiful and flattering and the colors are bright yet und,1
8002,I loved this dress when i saw it online perfect for a summer wedding but when i tried it on i was very disappointed the fabric and styling are gorgeous and very high quality but the sheer amount of fabric on this dress is just not as pictured there is layer after layer of silk and ruffle and while lovely it made me look very large i tried tying the belt many ways to no avail sadly it will have to go back it may look good on a very thin frame but didnt complement my average one,0

8008,I have loved this dress from the first time i saw it but the price scared me away until a sale came to be that meant i could justify buying it honestly its worth its original price im just too much of a scrooge to pay it the details are adorable the length makes it very versatile it seems well made and pretty weighty fits nicely due to the elastic in the back i got an i weigh with a small chest most of the dresses i buy are just as much art as they are fashion and this,1
8009,If i could get these in every color i would these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice i wear them with tshirts or dress them up with a blouse im a mom in my mids and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short these fit the bill,1

8013,I love this poncho because its the perfect weight and it is softer than i thought it would be i will get a lot of use out of it getting it on sale made it even better,1
8014,This dress is a work of art both online and in person the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric for short gals like me a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels otherw,1
8015,This cardigan is beautiful with its cropped fit flutter sleeves and vineyard detailing i can see wearing this a lot this fall and winter my only complaint is that the sweater was pillingshedding quite a bit the first time that i wore it i hope that that doesnt happen every time that i wear it i also have yet to wash it to see how the fabric looks after washing,1
8016,Ive been looking for a great long loose versatile vest for some time and this is just about perfect its slightly heavier than i would have preferred im in a warm climate but it excels in every other way it looks so much better on than it does on the hanger and can be dressed up or down definitely a steal on sale,1
8017,Seriously the best jeans i have bought in years better than my favorite paige and ag stevies i sized down from a tall to a tall and they still arent super tight i think maybe some could even go down sizes i do still have a lot of room in the waist but i am pretty straight through the hips i am almost with long legs and the tall is a great ankle length and fits me like the model wonderful stretch comfy great color and awesome ageing i dont normally like the ripped jean l,1
8018,I am in love with this top flannel shirts are a fall staple but i dont own any any flannel shirt that i have come across has been a button down which simply does not work for me given my chest size i hate button downs that gap or that i have to leave unbuttoned and wear a tank underneath its not flattering this top is flannel no buttons and off the shoulder which is such a unique and fresh style the off the shoulder feature stays in place thanks to tiny straps sewn in that you put,1
8019,I ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived its a soft orange color perfect for fall the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath but its longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans,1
8020,Really adorable and very retro looking fits true to size but i got it a size larger because i wanted to tie up the bottom have had it days have worn it twice already,1
8021,I was a little afraid to order this dress online but my local store only had a small left so i jumped hoping the fabled net would appear and it did this might be my favorite retailer dress thus far i ended up buying a large due to the fear of the front being too short it was a good call im sure a medium would have fit up top but i have longer legs and i know i wouldnt have felt comfortable in a mediums length plus i tend to like the oversized look i paired it with some slouchy socks and,1
8022,This vest is a stunner the dark brown suede is so beautiful the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest its hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch yes it is a little pricey but its an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too its a keeper,1
8023,This dress is super comfortable and flattering i went with the stripes and the p to shorten the length it looks amazing with otk boots however the material isnt very thick its more of a fallspring dress than a winter im a xss p in retailer dresses i went with the small xs wouldve fit but less flatteringly,1
8024,Pictures dont do this dress justice color in store is much more vibrant embroidered flower is more orangecoral colored also at certain angles depending on the lighting this dress looks navy blue versus black which i enjoyed sizing while i could have gotten away with my usual the side view was too voluminous and somewhat unflattering so i ended up sizing down to a for a more tailored look,1
8025,I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store it was a good sign when i saw our stores inhouse stylist wearing it i absolutely love the fitits soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality im typically a medium sometimes largei bought the medium and its perfect i could have gone down to a small as well the large was way too big for reference im athletic lbs this top is going to take me everywhere this summer worth a try,1
8026,Ugh i hate that this didnt work the top shouldersleeve portion is so pretty and unique but the fabric is overall this and cheap feeling the length is too short for how flowy the shirt is the sides go way up on me the fabric feels like something that would fall apart after one wash back it goes,0
8027,These are way oversized i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large wasted money on shipping wont do that again,0
8028,Beautifully cut and styledits versatile and can be paired with trousers or a skirt,1

8034,This dress is super comfortable and well made i am lbs and the large was a little too big but with a belt it worked out just fine,1
8035,I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is it looks and feels expensive and of good quality it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area i look forward to wearing this top all through the fallwinterholiday seasons,1
8036,I love this tshirt i feel classy stylish and comfortable wearing it as other reviewers have noted it is bellowy in the peplum but that is the design and i love it it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual another terrific purchase from retailer,1
8037,I ordered the in the emerald green and it was sent to me with a dime size hole in the sleeve i am very disappointed because i love the sweater by the time it arrived it was sold out in my size now i cannot exchange it for one that is not damaged if the sweater was not damaged i would recommend this product,0
8038,Remarkable dress so much so that people stop me to remark about it,1

8041,I am so in love with these pants i generally stay away from wide legged pants because i think they make me look shorter i am already short but these are awesome the fabric is not very thick so they are moveable which is great but not so moveable that they feel like palazzo pantsthey will hold their shape i love the polka dot design so much and i actually really love the whole outfit with the black tietop these pants are long on me but it isnt surprising since i am pretty short i am t,1
8042,I absolutely love this shawljacket i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when its too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket the blackbrown works great with whatever youre wearing so versatile and i love that it has pockets,1
8043,I loooove this my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently ran out of s p while in my basket there are never enough petites available so i got the medium it is big but with this style i can pull it off it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect please make this in more colorsfabrics i would buy them all,1

8047,I love the greenish option beautiful color the fabric super soft and like the peek thru openings on the arms they call it lace but its not really im and lbs medium was good it is long but it is what i wanted so works for me,1
8048,I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer store but they didnt have my size someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up i probably would have bought the xs but it was gone i went with it a little oversized and love it great quality and workmanship on the embroidery more like the items that retailer used to sell in and super cute love it,1
8049,This top has glam written all over it the pleating gives it a delicate look but is not cheaply made or feeling it lays so beautifuli would say this runs tts but because i am busty i sized up to give it more of flowy look because i am busty it also looks like high low blouse no need for a necklace the flowers and shimmer do all the work for you i paired it with leather leggins and it was adorable,1
8050,Handsdown one of the more comfortable shirts ive purchased from retailer,1
8051,Perfect for a hot day and skins the body beautifully so soft i am usually a medium but got a small which fit perfect usually swing dresses do not compliment the waistline but this one did,1
8052,I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didnt look very cute i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on im so glad i did the inside gray material is so soft i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all it is very comfortable i bought the xsmall and was very surprised at how roomy it was the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up not sure if the xxsmall wouldve been too small or if the,1
8053,I recently purchased this cardigan and got so many compliments the first day i wore it the detail is so exquisite it will be worth every penny,1
8054,I love the idea of this shirt but the execution is absolutely horrible i ordered online and what i received is just a mess the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread not just a few hanging off but literally big clumps a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside the fit is just as big a mess i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br,0
8055,Absolutely love everything about this dress unlike many other dresses ive ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest c its very flattering love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen cant wait to wear it i got the s regular if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right like it was made for me,1
8056,The sweater is light and very soft the silver banding on the neck sleeves and hem make it easy to dress up,1
8057,I love this dress the design and colors used are beautifully done it looks stunning on can be worn for work or dressed up,1
8058,Saw this in store and knew i gotta have it beautiful colors and slimming effect,1
8059,I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt i hate to say it but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky childrens book character and not retailer the fabric made it look bulky i sadly had to return it,0
8060,Retailer sleep pants are my favoritethe only sleep pants i will wear fit is perfect flowing shape and ultrasoft fabric feel like a little bit of luxury first thing i put on when i get home from work,1

8064,I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online the fabric is interestingit looks almost plastic in the online pictures but dont be fooled it is still a comfortable fabric it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th,1
8065,When i tried them on i didnt want to take them off they are so soft so stylish they drape your body just the right way they are stretchy so even though i am wearing in jeans i took s regular run hone and tried it on with moss cowled sidezip tunic different booties and aquaflora reversible vest all variations and combos looked really cool and great i even tried with high heeled booties and dressier sweater top warmup pullover in charcoal looked like high couture the color i,1
8066,The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is it is giant petite ladies stay away from this sweater i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs but this just floored me the neckline wouldnt even stay up on my upper body it was that loose also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model it is like a tent im so bummed the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft its too bad it doesnt fit smaller women,0
8067,I went into the store to look at a few certain items this wasnt one of them but it really caught my eye i got it in yellow it is such a great sweater tts,1
8068,These are just as cute as pictured they are generously sized made from soft denim the denim has quite a bit of stretch i ordered a size down from my normal size i was surprised by all the extra threads in the pockets they were still attached to the inside of the pockets it just made them feel a little unfinished these didnt impact the overall wear or appearance of the garment the straps are adjustable with two buttons on the overalls and three straplength adjustments on the straps the,1
8069,I just love this dress so comfortable and flattering maeve has had some great dresses this summer but this one may be my favorite this one could easily been worn in to fall with a sweater or jacket,1

8071,Im curvy have very muscular thighs and am just under i was not very optimistic when the sales associate told me i would love these jeans she was right theyre amazing they are incredibly flattering just the right length for me even tho cropped as i can wear them as fulllength or just add one or two rolls and its a crop the fabric is amazingly soft and they immediately felt like a favorite old pair of jeans the pockets are well placed so they do wonders for the bootie oh and,1
8072,I ordered these jeans twice because i love them the first pair were mismarked by about sizes so i reordered second pair still didnt fit they run really small i would probably need one maybe two sizes larger than normal to achieve the fit and feel of the other skinny jeans in my closet,0
8073,I loved this tshirt i got the grey one in small im a size and it is a relaxed fit i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair i didnt want t plan t shirt but i also didnt want anything too crazy fits well and is soft too,1
8074,This green sweater is solo pretty i wanted it from the moment i saw it pretty layers on the bottom make it so unique,1
8075,This is one of my absolute favorites the design is perfect and the fabric is so beautiful i dont love the coral color but the mixed pattern is amazing it runs a little large i sized down one size and it fit perfectly its very flowy and comfortable its these unique special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases ive gotten so many compliments very highly recommend,1
8076,I love this style reminds me of what we used to wear back in the s its very cute flattering and material is a high quality will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans if you like this baby doll style youll love this,1
8077,This dress fit perfectly and as i am a bit curvy the style compliments my figure it is a bit fuller in the bottom than the photo looks also i am and it is a right to the bottom of my knees which is also very complimentary,1
8078,Love this blouse its so darn cute the fabric is soft flows nicely and is just absolutely stunning without being over the top it falls at the lower part of my hip the softness of the fabric would make this easy to tuck in the body of the shirt sleeves cuffs and placket are contrasting florals in black and creamy white the top part is a brownish burgundy color and the flowersbutterflies are embroidered in goldenrod yellow peach creamy white two mauve tones turquoise and brown the li,1
8079,How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south until i washed it i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out first of all the smell was unbelievable i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that it shrunk even though i handwashed it line dried it and pampered it to no end,0
8080,This is a great top not cheap but funky it would look nice on any figure the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows great value for a pretty party top but it can go anywhere,1
8081,I fell in love with this poncho at first sight the colors are neutral so it can be worn with a lot im a typical m and it does run large so i went with a s and its perfect long enough to cover leggings and great for the in between seasons ive worn it at least five times since purchase and get compliments every time,1
8082,I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank but the quality and true shimmeryness are worth it it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters very happy with my purchase,1
8083,This blazer is really well made it has a nice weight and stretch to it i think it might run a bit on the large size i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect its a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look i dont think the picture here does it justice it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe i love it,1
8084,I got the floral suit and honestly its the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i dont know how it holds up when getting wet i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest it is padded which is nice but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up if you are big chested this could be an issue not so much for me looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer,1
8085,I wore these with high heels to a formal gathering i received many compliments perfect for summer you can dress them up with heels or wear flats or sandals and be casual i have a pear shape so i think they fit best for my body type love them,1
8086,Review title says almost all add to that that it is age appropriate unlike other kedia dresses for the very young just too cute for words i have all of the other tk peasant dresses and although youthful they are appropriate for anyone young of heart this however on an older woman looks ridiculous i would have liked it for those months but even then it would cover quadruplets,0
8087,Super cute in raspberry and very flattering i paired it with the reversible tank in dark gray skinny jeans and fringe boots,1
8088,I love this jumpsuit its fun flirty and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby it works for multiple occasionsevents and is so comfortable if daytime pajamas sounds good to you this is your jumpsuit dress it up with an updo and dangly earrings or down with slipons and a cardigan i have found that i cant go wrong with it fits me just perfectly doesnt wrinkle too much during wear and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient,1
8089,Based on other customer reviews i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer however the fabric is much heavier than what id usually wear in the summer the cut of the trousers were superb though i like a lowrise or hipster cut which these arethey are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy so if you are an xs these will be xs or runs small for retailer clothing if you like your clo,0
8090,I had hoped this blouse would be white but it is cream in color it was also more boxy than i thought it would be i am usually a or a and went with the a size would be a better fit,0
8091,Its really crazy how much i like this sweater i am surprised by the weight of the sweater it is a mediumlight weight that will be appropriate year round it fits perfectly and is very flattering open or zipped i will wear this as a stand alone top with a tank underneath for now and in place of a spring jacket when the weather is warmer this is a nice find,1
8092,Love these shorts they do run large i wear a in pilcro and the in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare the turquoise is definitely green and not as bright as what i see in the online photo but still a nice color they have a funny smell but im sure that will wash out,1
8093,I managed to find this huit eden lagoon fixed straps foam bandeau swimsuit in a size c and it fits perfectly my current measurements are or hips and i normally wear a d or c brai have a longish torso yet this doesnt ride up fits like on the model there is a thin strip of silicone around the back to keep it from sliding down the vshape is held by a hard wire but it doesnt cut in anywhere the soft black straps are sewn in and not adjustable but do hold their shap,1
8094,Great mock neck fits well and looks great with pants and skirts also love the dark grey color,1
8095,The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket the print is great i love it its so different than any other jackets ive seen while the jacket is ber cute it is a bit bulky though the waist tie helps with that and its not heavy winter appropriate its not waterproof or heavily insulated for your average winter day though it will be a fun option the removable v,1
8096,I saw this in the store and it caught my eye right away due to its bold color and pattern i tried on an extra small and it was large especially in the sleeves i ordered an extra small in petite and it fits perfectly i love the velvet and jeweled detail along with the cris cross tie i wore it to work today and received so many compliments one lady said how artsy i looked i paired it with burgundy velvet tie up boots to complete the look totally worth the money ladies,1
8097,Saw this skirt online and ordered immediatelyit is even more beautiful in personstunning hemline and a gorgeous shade of teali ordered my usual size and it fits to perfectionvery very true to size,1
8098,I bought the color black motifalthough the markings look more dark purple and are similar to tie dyed coloring which is one of the things i love about this top the fabric is so soft and i love the way the neckline falls it is slightly sheer so may want to wear camisole underneath personally im fine without it looks great with jeans i also tried it on in the blue motif which is the stripe version but found nothing special about that one,1
8099,This dress fits perfectly and true to size the waist detail and flair is fun and flirty its probably my favorite dress ive ever bought,1
8100,This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress really love it however theres no way that model is in the photo because im inches shorter than that and the dress is inches shorter on me its really not a dress its a tunic im happy with it because its so pretty but i did think i was buying a dress i just wore it with leggings and im happy with a beautiful tunic,1
8101,This is my second pair of these jeans i ruined the first pair and immediately ordered a replacement wear them all the time i did go up one size to get a better fit i dont exactly have slim thighsha but other than that they are pretty perfect,1
8102,This top is really beautiful my girlfriend saw it on a rack outside the dressing room or i would not have seen it i tried it on and loved it instantly it does run a bit big and i ordered the extra small to make sure which one would work the photos dont do it justice reminds me of retailer of years ago when just about everything in the store was truly unique,1
8103,I purchased these in white and love them fit my muscular thighs fine,1
8104,Unique jacket but when i put it on i felt and looked like charlie brown this will be going back,0
8105,This dress is gorgeous amazing colors drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work,1
8106,This arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on this is the epitome of the effortless tank its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace unfortunately it didnt quite work for me if you have any kind of tummy or chest size up i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me however my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on,1
8107,This one didnt work for me there is no zipper you climb into it from the very large neck hole it was very low cut and the shoulders kept sliding off but the bottom half fit snug the tie and waist seam didnt hit at my waist but the largest part of my middle i tried other belts and it wasnt much better the fabric and print were great i love jumpers but this one went back,0
8108,I bought this stylish and cozy sweater in ivory i find that cable knit sweaters tend to add bulk but this sweater creates a long lean look it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans and the buttons on the cowl are a fun detail every time i wear this i get compliments on it,1
8109,Get this one during the sale if you dry clean it you will have it forever,1
8110,Adorable unique swtr wld go w many things note that front pocket is slightly higher than the other looks that way in the pic too its the retailer unique touch i dont mind abt that its too itchy for me i ordered the sp to have shorter armsfell just above my knuckles which is fine i have many tnecks to wear under it but i decided i really didnt need another itchy swtr so returned no worry retailer has plenty of other items of interest,1
8111,I love the pilcro serif legging jeans but these were a big disappointment if you have any thigh at all dont bother,0
8112,This cape is stunning the perfect addition to any closet it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans the fur is so soft and the quality is superior it has real fur hooks four to close it and the side pockets are adorable definitely a buy and a bargain on sale,1
8113,These leggings are super comfy i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully lately ive been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them,1
8114,I got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite and love both the length is perfect for my height and theyre not skin tight but fit like a glove i have a waist and hips the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if im not careful but its easy to flip it back i think thats the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions which say to hand wash only i wish they had been made machine washa,1
8115,I love this blouse i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging i dont live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively i have larger hips lbs and finding flattering tops can be tough sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on they just dont look right some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter this top looked great a,1
8116,I loved the look of this sweater online but it just didnt work for me the fit wasnt good enough the style okay the color fine the feel scratchy overall it did not work for my body,0
8117,Purchased the cream color in my local store it looks great with jeans or leggings ive worn it with a bright cami underneath with a couple of buttons open and it looked really cute too it is very comfortable runs big but its meant to not be fitted the addition of pockets that dont stick out makes me love it even more i will be wearing this from fall to spring great design retailer,1
8118,This shirt is so flattering i bought it in the recent it color but i wish it came in some additional brighter hues this shirt is just so lovely its long in length too,1
8119,Ill admit i had a lot of sticker shock when i saw this was a moth sweater coat at this price point but i was immediately drawn to it this is a one of a kind piece for sure the colors are vibrant the design is stylish and it is beautifully unstructured it has a cocoon shape wool on the outside and a soft knit on the inside its a bit heavier as you would expect a wool coat to be my absolute favorite part is the print very classic on top and very boho on bottom it is gorgeous i woul,1
8120,Cute but very itchy have to wear a long sleeve tee underneath,0
8121,This top is just adorable im usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and its a little more roomy i wanted it to be long enough the colors are beautiful and its a must have,1
8122,I ordered this dress in the red stripe and i love it it is casual and easy to wear with flat sandals or booties the dress is not really sheer like you might think from the picture and it included a nice knit under slip in a pale peachy pink shade that fits true to size as well the dress has more of a soft woven cotton feel to it the slip is not really necessary but nice that it is included i looked at the blue color but it looks more like a tunic in the pictures i think that the looks are,1
8123,The shirt does have a weird yellow tinge as other reviewers have described i could get over that if the shirt was a flattering fit which it was not not worth the money so i returned it,0
8124,This dress is everything im athletic build d and the medium fit me perfectly the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but thats one of those things only i notice and definitely didnt keep me from falling in love and buying it cant wait to wear it on vacation next week,1
8125,Love this soft sweatshirt the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great go to piece for spring loose fitting but true to size in shoulders,1
8126,These short are the best the denim is incredibly soft they go perfect with both casual and nice tops i would wear them out everyday if i could,1
8127,Great color and shape for all seasons i was so elated to get this piece on sale love it,1
8128,This top is super cute and colorful admittedly i have not used it just as a pajama top because i think the world deserves to see this piece of art super comfy and i recommend this for everyone in most shapes and sizes,1
8129,Very cute on fits well versatile top i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall,1
8130,I love the color of this dress it is not flattering even though it should be the weird panels of different materials makes it hang super funky the lace is heavy but the silky panels arent so not flattering its just odd and the fit is super huge you are swimming in it in addition to a poor body drape it could have been so cute but was executed so poorly,0
8131,I returned the dress because the color was not as pictured in the online photo i did not like the color,0
8132,I was so excited to buy it online but it come in a small plastic bag and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got so i had to return it,0
8133,I love this dress its definitely an investment but well worth the price i get so many compliments on it every time i wear it and it can definitely be dressed up or down for casual or formal events,1
8134,The lightweight knit and flattering colors made this top so perfect for me that i bought it for full price its big so id size down youll still get a forgiving shape flattering colors and just a really nice option for work or off hours,1
8135,This is a very pretty blouse with a vintage romantic looking fabric the tiny pleats near the neck and shoulders are lovely i love the colorsblack brown and cream its hard to find a top that can be worn well with both black and brown the long tie adds a romantic feel this blouse is totally sheer so requires a cami or tank i actually love the blouse but returned it because it is super blousy i am lbs and the small was fine it is just so blousy that even belting it didn,1
8136,In paper crown dresses i wear a small or size so for this top i ordered a small it was huge on me for reference im lbs a it is very wide towards the bottom and it flares out way more than in the picture the material is also a little stiff so it really sticks out even if i sized down to the xs i think the bottom would still look unflattering so im returning this,0
8137,Love this top with swingloose tops i always size down im b and took a it fit very well i tried a on as well and i could see what the other reviewers were saying about the top part not laying flat so size down if you can i got white so i use a nude bandeau bra with it works well,1
8138,This is a gorgeous sweater with a great proportion in terms of length and fit i am petite so i worried that such a long sweater might look weird on me but it actually makes me look slim and taller i get so many compliments when i wear it i ordered the xxs petite,1
8139,Totally love this sweater everything about it i find to match the model pics fit color length no dry cleaning required on this one so i plan to get other colors to wear with leggings and skinnies fall through winter i love that this is oversized without looking frumpy it does have some shape to it and the knit falls perfects not a heavychunky sweaterthink soft midweight that you can layer with worth full price,1
8140,Thered a reason this dress is all over instagram and like its stunning and beautiful perfect for a wedding or event the beading is beautiful and the tiers on the dress are more flattering than youd expect especially since it does have a bit of pouff to it love it stats i sized up so that it would be longer,1
8141,I received this top by mail yesterday and opened it this morning all i can say is wow its gorgeous the detailing is stunning classic retailer amazing a true standout piece cant wait to wear,1
8142,I wanted to like this but it just didnt have much of a shape not flattering at all maybe if i was taller,0
8143,I wanted to love this top but it unfortunately did not work for me the material has a nice weight and feel to it and while i love the pattern the shape leaves something to be desired the cap sleeves were a little tight on my arms and the cut of the sleeves made my arms look big the body of this shirt reminded me of a loose maternity top for reference i am lbs and typically a size i wear a small in retailer clothes and got a small in this top i think an xs would have been to,0
8144,This top is so cute a little cropped light for a sweater tank in my opinion and runs a little big so i sized down one size beautiful fabric and fit the ruffles are such a fun addition definitely recommend with a high waisted pant or skirt for work so cute,1
8145,I love this dress i do agree with the other reviewers it does come up higher on the sides it has a hilo hem style on me but im short and got the petite xxs and its not too short to wear as a dress its super cute if youre shorter and dont mind showing a little leg i highly recommend it,1
8146,I adore this top its comfortable and cute the sleeve length is great for wearing bracelets its wellmade just perfect,1
8147,I have a few pair of charlies and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit i own this pair in both the orange and gray bought both in my normal they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on dont size up definitely recommend these pants,1
8148,Love this dress the light fabric quality color and design all added to the grecian goddess feeling my usual fit perfectly giving me a great shape and the length is great,1
8149,This turtleneck is already wrapped and its soon going under the tree for me i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on its fitted but not too tight or snug just fitted and flattering the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple both for dress and casual ill wash it carefully just in case it seems well made but id hate to snag the lace,1
8150,Very cute skort that fits tts great length for us middle aged women as well love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts im assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband i usually try to wait for the sale prices but i think this skort will sell out well before then,1
8151,This dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures im petite and so its longer on me than it is on the model i got a p and the waist was perfect i thought it might look matronly as it was longer but it looks classic i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap its so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area which is icing on the cake i had absolutely no reason to buy it but once i tried it,1
8152,This cropped trouser is very high quality and perfect for summer i ordered my usual size petite i am lb and i felt a little tight but since other previous reviews said they do stretch after wearing it i decided to keep it i hope they stretch out a little bit more overall i am very happy with my purchase,1
8153,I bought this cute ruffled tank in ivory to go with a silk wrap skirt ive had it arrived today and it fits perfect i am lbs and small busted b i bought size small after reading the reviews and glad i did because it fits perfect the straps are not too long a common problem for me its a nice length nipped a bit a bit at the waist with slight flare below also it does not gap under the arms which is much appreciated a lot of thought went into this little top i can wear it to,1
8154,Sometimes i feel like i have to try on the dresses that sell out super fast just out of curiosity and sometimes theyre surprise hits like this one i tried on the purpleblackblue option and i had to have it it is boxy through the torso but the length keeps it from being too cutesyits pretty short im just and im not sure this is work appropriate without tights i may have to try though as otherwise its a great workable dress for summernot too tight or revealing in the b,1
8155,This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarityand especially at this length unfortunately this is a mess in terms of proportions if a size can barely get it off then there is a design flaw sadly the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws,0
8156,I wore it for the first time this week and received so many compliments i bought the white one and its a tiny bit see through but still love it,1
8157,Super cute casual top im usually a medium and this fit perfectly lbs its not quite as long as it is on the model but cute nonetheless,1
8158,This top is so perfect for the fall flowy beautiful embroidery and paired with jeans and brown bootsgorgeous wore it once and got a lot of compliments im and ordered a size worked too but just a tad tight in the arms,1
8159,Theres a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse the print is lovely but the fit is very odd its pulls at and is very tight through the bust too i wear medium or large and ordered size large if youre less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide returned,0
8160,These truly are tights and not leggings they could not be worn alone but definitely great under skirts or dresses they are thick and warm i thought they ran a little big,1
8161,Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff shaking it out did nothingalmost like it was dipped in drying glue i got this for which is so cheap and i still returned it,0
8162,I really love this piece its so different from anything else i own the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels the only downside is the upper body fit im and lbs with more of an hourglass shape i did not fill out the top at all although the shorts fit fine around my waist,1
8163,I almost walked past this until i saw it on the display mannequin the shimmer is very subtle but there the picture here makes hte shirt look more like a grey shirt but it is more sophisticated in person very soft fabric fitted on the wasit but romier on top cowl is super flattering usual sizze fit very nicely highly recommend i wont hev to tuck it in everytime i wear it i think it can be dressed up skirt or down jeans almost a basic t,1
8164,does this sweater make my hips look big my wife asked this sweater was one of my christmas gifts to this fair maidenno love it does not i said but i looked to make sure my reflex was also correct its a beautiful sweater for my dear bride mother of our three children and no it does not make her hips look bigin fact it draws out all her lovely lines and curves just so and she is a modest girl so she wears a little undershirt so that her cleavage is somewhatumsuppre,1
8165,Great cut and high quality fabric the top gives you a nice hourglass shape and i love the way it hangs halfway down your butt,1
8166,I loved this shirt so much i bought it in colors however two of them shrunk i was very disappointed,0
8167,Loves it this is my new favorite top its prettyits perfect cannot find any bad to say about it,1
8168,This dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out it so comfy and versatile will never go out of style it does run large but that is just the style of the dress it really is the perfect summer dress,1
8169,This dress is adorable it fits loose and is not at all fitted with the exception of the under cami lining the picture showing front and back is being pulled to fit it fits like the model wearing the purple my local store was out of my normal size so i sized up which really made no difference at all the biggest difference would be the under cami the dress is flowy and airy one of the best casual dresses retailer has had in a long time obviously the blue is sold out till may this can b,1
8170,I love this sweatshirt new favorite it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit love the little inspirational quote and its the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in so stinking soft got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school,1
8171,Love this skirt easy to wear and very flattering looks better in person i saw it at the store and bought it when i looked at it online i didnt realize it was the same skirt this is a go to skirt comfy and sexy all in one even wore it to the airport with a pair of boots and sweatersuper comfortable and still looked nice great purchase,1
8172,I ordered this shirt last week its beautiful its even prettier than the photo im lbs i ordered the petite and it fit perfectly i wish it came in more colors id order another one in a minute,1
8173,The pants are everything i expected and much more the material is a delicious and light weight the colors are beautifulwhite base with jade green and black design there is a very comfortable elastic band waist with tie i am and ordered the longer length and they are just to the ground i weigh and have a slim figure and the medium is a very comfortable fit i would highly recommend these if you like looks that are up to date and comfythese are a winwin,1
8174,Noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store i am lbs with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots as another reviewer suggested i think a denim shirt will look great underneath rated a good in quality b,1
8175,I ordered the gold in size xl it fits true to size matching the online photos the color details are prettier in person such a comfortable tee its washeddried well too i hope they make more colors for this fall its been a great basic,1
8176,My perspective is as a sewer so im more picky perhaps this top is poorly made the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece sewers do this to save squeezing the pieces on the fabric it looks sloppy the cut is very full the bottom edge measures around for my figure curvey at and lbs this top is not flattering it looks maternity perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings,0
8177,Let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so id better listen up and because i really like the other bailey dress i own wow i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this i love it my husband loves it and its comfy for reference i did size down and went with a petite had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on,1
8178,I love this dress it is perfect for a wedding brunch with friends or even work it is beautifully made and is comfortable i have it in the yellow colorway but i am tempted to go back and purchase it in the purple colorway as well,1
8179,Love the diving beauty version it is charming without being too cutsie which i stay away from the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement i find it runs true to sizeyou could safely size down if need be love it thinking of getting the here comes the sun too tuck it in tie it in the back or side or great just drapinglove the little touch on the sleeve toonice surprise,1
8180,These pants are more like not i was very dissappointed the color is great and so is the fabricif you look more closely at the model the pants dont fit her either they are too small i havent decided whether or not to take them back because i am losing weight i am a so far but these pants are like a i need the color because they go perfectly with a top i bought from retailer,0
8181,I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it i almost always wear a size small at retailer d and the fit and length are both perfect on me if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri,1
8182,Dressed up or dressed down this summer dress is perfect the skirt is a lot of fabric like others have said but its part of what makes this dress fun and because the top is fitted i find it very flattering because you can adjust the tie around the waist to make it fitted that being said the design sort of threw me off when it arrived in the mail because the waist as well as straps around the shoulders are adjustable at first it looked like a sack but when its on and adjusted it will l,1
8183,I bought the lavender one and im so glad i did the sweater looks prettier in person and its super soft the back detailing makes this one not your average vneck sweater i highly recommend this to anyone,1
8184,This has quickly become my goto cardigan its light which will make it great for the spring and summer nights i got it in the rose and loved it so much i bought the olive too bought a small fits perfectly arm length is great too,1
8185,Confortable and looks great how ever you wear it,1
8186,This really is a gorgeous jacket i would give it stars just because sometimes it can be a bit unflattering in the tummy area poofs out a bit at certain times but i had to remind myself that is the style of the coat i am petite and curvy on bottom so this could just be me tried wearing with a skinny belt and it looked cute i think i will try both ways seems very warm beautful colors and the material is soft and not itchy at all excited because versatile for everyday wear but also l,1
8187,I saw this dress in the store and immediately grabbed it i think that if id only seen it online i wouldnt have looked at it twice in person the fabric is so beautiful a shining and classy velvet crinkle that could go way way dressy with the right accessories this dress runs large like all of floreats items i am and normally wear an xs or but had to size down to xxs petite for the right fit like on the model the only drawback is dry clean only based on the content of th,1
8188,I bought this instore after seeing it online and am in love with the shape the cropped legs give it a style advantage in my opinion for reference im lbs and a bcup i got the xs the torso was too baggy and lost its shape with a small as one reviewer mentioned it seems to be meant to be worn with a shirt underneath ive tried with longer sleeved tops and with tank tops and they both look great especially white it has a modern cut and is very versatile i plan to wear,1
8189,This top is so nice i bought it in colors washes well but does need to be ironed fits true to size,1
8190,This jacket is pretty cute in person it is a nice thick gauzy material the black is more like a dark washed gray color while i do like the jacket i feel like it is cut a little wide maybe i should have ordered a size down i usually wear a combination of s and s and am usually between a small and medium i ordered this in a medium but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area im returning the jacket for now but might reorder in a small another time,1
8191,I like these pants a lot got one pair in blackand one pair in holly the green holly are just a perfect green so nice for the season they are very comfy and feel right all day without any saggingi highly recommend and would buy more if they werent on the pricier sideoh and great for causal but also dresses up nicely with some heels and a silk blouse,1
8192,I bought this nightgown to wear as a winter maternity dress it really fit the bill the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress it would be way too hot it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer the length was not awkward and kept it from being to,1
8193,This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket it has a roomy comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist got lots of compliments on the embroidery,1
8194,I stumbled upon the blue version in the store i immediately liked that it was easy chic and just differentenough after wearing it for a birthday dinner i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown black sandal wedges silver cuff silver earrings it is flattering in an unexpected way which may be partially because i am really smallchested the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear but doublesided tape easily kept my bra,1
8195,This skirt is fabulous i ordered it in both grey and green only flaw was the grey one was inches shorter all the way around made it too short so i kept the green great for summer and maybe fall with flats and a jacket,1
8196,Got this top in white and the rust color other reviewers mentioned it being much too large so i went with the xs instead of my usual small its slightly oversized but i love that look and its still flattering on me i also didnt find there to be too much fabric i am very tall and am happy with the length of this b lbs,1
8197,This skirt is everything i love about retailer the fit style and quality are amazing i feel like a am wearing a piece of art it is so unique and fits perfectly way to go retailer,1
8198,This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment i was in loveee with the picture in real life not so much the material felt thin and cheap and the yellow was super yellow nothing like the picture i was so bummed returned it earlier today,0
8199,I wanted to love this couldnt wait for it to arrive unfortunately it doesnt look anything like the picture i usually wear a ml in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way and it is extremely shimmery i love velvet but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top sadly it is going back,0
8200,Very pretty dress and a bit different than what we see in the shopsi found the material to be very nice despite one of the reviewers commentsit is a sheath that is not skin tight but shows curves great for dancingalso i did not find the neck too tight fits finetts as normally a petite which is a wonderful fit and sometimes a petite or depending on the cut the was too largeall in all a feminine uncommon dresslooking forward to wearing it to one of the weddings th,1
8201,Love the crochet and and it is a great feel with a liner underneath that comes with the dress a little boxy but another beautiful retailer dress overall,1
8202,I love this tank its something you can dress up with a skirt or wear over jeans i like loose fitting tops although i have a slender frame this is also so comfortable i went with a size medium and it fits perfect,1
8203,Ive been looking for the right swing dress for a long time and this one is perfect one of my favorite features is the design at the hem of the dress it looks even better in person the material is a thicker almost canvasy type of fabric which i love because it makes the dress feel higher quality to me i love how comfortable the dress is and its so easy to throw it on and look amazing i tried on two sizes at two different stores and received compliments from staff and customers both ti,1
8204,Wanted to buy this dress but the bust area was way too small as i went up sizes the torso began to be too long and i would have to have it altered i guess what a shamebut if you are small chested then this is your dress,1
8205,I tried this on a whim last week even though it was a bit above my budget and i couldnt resist taking it home the photo doesnt do the textured sheen of the silk justicethe metallic tones of the flowers are really vibrant but still subtle my husband who usually hates anything with a bow loves this though i have been tying the bow a bit lower than shown on the model go one size downi usually wear a in blouses but took a in this,1
8206,I was pleasantly surprised with this one fits a bit large im the fits just right the moss is a great staple color,1
8207,Would not have picked this out online but it caught my eye in the store the blue color is gorgeous its a flattering style that drapes well and will pair with just about any short jean capri or summer weight pant and a number of chic accessories you will not be disappointed,1
8208,I saw this vest at my local retailer store over the weekend and decided to try it on i am typically an xs at retailer and the xs fit perfectly i cant wait to wear this during the spring and summer its really lightweight and soft which i love i purchased the copper color and would consider the color in the photo to be very true this was definitely a splurge but i am overall very happy with my purchase i highly recommend it,1
8209,I purchased these pants online in my usual size petite and they were a perfect fit for me i have a waist hips and im and found them to be a little long but not so much that i want to hem them as ill be wearing these with my clogs and platforms anyway if i want to be able to wear them with flats ill need to hem them but i bought them to go with my higher shoes so its no bother these are very slimming pants and zip up at the back they are a tad difficult to zip up but not,1
8210,This top is very soft and well made for my short and curvy figure it is very unflattering i considered altering it but there is no way to do it it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all it wont show because this top is boxy and full in that area if you are tall and slim it might be perfect so give it a try,0
8211,Love this dress must try on to see how cute is really is,1
8212,This dress has been on retailers site for a while now years and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale i cant believe i waited so long its so gorgeous on classy but still distinctly sexy im and the size fits great definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in beautiful dress overall,1
8213,This was my first mother denim purchase and ive already gotten another color love the feel of this denim its heavy enough to smooth out any imperfections and manages to stay tight not stretch out while being comfortable this color is perfect too so flattering love,1
8214,I am floored by the amount of positive reviews on this dress when i received it it looked nothing like it does on the model the bottom looked like dirty sand and was completely wrinkled if you have anything above a c cup the top looks completely unflattering i looked so top heavy in this dress definitely not worth the price so disappointed,0
8215,Even on sale this was just too pricey for what it is which is a glorified tank i liked the straps but it hangs very wide off your chest,0
8216,This tank is very loose fitting which i can understand would make some think it runs large taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted i love the draped styling which i also think makes sense with the pattern its an easy top toojust throw on and go and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest,1
8217,I had my eye on this skirt online but it sold it out in my size so i ordered a and crossed my fingers before it arrived i happened across a size at my retailer store that someone had returned it fit perfectly i am and my waist is it is high waisted but i thought that added to the fit and made it stand out from the usual black skirt it fit my waist and hipsbutt fine it is quality material and has a structured fit and great length it is unique and classic i can see this b,1
8218,I was pleasantly surprised how this dress fit me very comfortable and flattering on me love the look need to watch not to wear anything scratchy as it may pull the fabric,1
8219,In the words of my husband looks like youre wearing a bag im althetic and short maybe this works best on tall and very slim,0
8220,I am not sure why the first reviewed hated this dress so much i personally like that it looks a tad retro length is shorter but not mini or too short i ordered the xxs p and it looked ok on me and i am older the colors are fun and appropriate for fall or winter the sparkle golden thread can bring this dress into the holiday season and beyond i love the turtleneck part only thing is it is really high and the embroidery gets a little lost in it top of the design feel is thick no,1
8221,This is very practical it goes with many things and is very comfortableit can be worn with different leggings or with jeans and it is well made thanks retailer,1
8222,I love this tshirt i fabric is soft yet has a nice weight to it it is comfortable yet sexy,1
8223,I love the colors of this dress and i waited for the sale since it isnt really good for work i wear size in hd all the time but this one doesnt fit at all on the top the bust is cut for someone really curvy but the bottom is for someone really straight i dont know what they were using for a model but this has to be tried on before purchased the material is also rough and there is no lining to protect you from that i love my hd dresses for style and functionality but this one is j,0
8224,Just received this dress today i bought it for a vacation we are taking to mexico i wanted a nice coverupthis is beautiful fits nicely without looking like a tenti would highly recommend this is one size fits all,1
8225,This is an awesome shirt gorgeous quality and design can be dressed up or down it runs slightly large i ordered a small i would still order a small but if you are trying to decide between a small and an extra small i would get the extra small,1
8226,Love the blue color is a bit short but fine with a tank underneath i purchased the small thats what i usually wear,1
8227,This cardigan is so much more beautiful in person i thought it would be very lightweight but it has a nice weight to it this will go with absolutely everything and looks lovely on,1
8228,I must politely disagree with the previous review i hesitated to order this item based on the reviewer below and i am happy to say this item is everything i hoped it would be it looks exactly like the picture fit color quality being a silk top i believe this item was priced appropriately and the quality of the item does not disappoint the pom poms are colorful and bright but not the least bit juvenile this top is light and flowy yet flattering for hot humid summer days i will look for,1
8229,This pullover is perfect for spring all the way into fall it is comfortable and the perfect piece to throw on over a summery tank and jeans ive even worn it over dresses before and it worked great soft fabric but durable ive had a lot of compliments on this pullover and recommend it for you,1
8230,These are called jeans but they arent exactly jean material they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work i like these very much a very slimming effect mid rise which looks very chichighly recommend,1
8231,This is a nice looking skirt the corduroy has a little sheen to it looks cute with a sweater tights and boots length is slightly longer on me than the model in the photo there are small slits at the side seams and the hem is curved at the slits,1
8232,Soft florals on light as air chiffon layerswhats not to like on this romantic dress i appreciate the elastic waist and the tie at the back of the neck as it gives me flexibility during my weight fluctuations my only regret is that im too darn short for regular length and will have to wear platforms since the back of the hem drags on my self purchased the size and i am dd,1
8233,The fit of these jeans are so great they look syllish and feel great at the same time this brand does a fabulous job of creating a jean that feels like you can wear them dressed up and casual a,1
8234,The peach color is beautiful on this jacket and the quality and comfort is perfect i wear a medium and the sizing was spoton i may get in another color if a sale comes around again,1
8235,This is a really great dress especially for the holiday season you can do work and post work events with it easily i ordered a large but it fit me more like a medium it is very comfortable and the quality feels great boots give it the day look and a nice set of beige high heels gave it a great evening look,1
8236,I had been eyeing this top online decided to hit my local retailer to try it on it is an adorable spring tunici think it runs a size larger then your usual size for reference i am and pds small busted and i bought a size fits perfect i will machine wash and hang to dry happy with my purchase,1
8237,I really did heres why i just couldnt the lace strips make it look cheap the fabric is soft but the pattern is undistinguished the fit is very disappointingmedium looked square and boxy the large was massive and in both sizes the vneck was too low to wear without a camisole underneathwhich defeated the purpose,0
8238,Such a lovely well constructed top looks great on petite frames free flowing but not too peasantlike the embroidery is gorgeous while it is pricey it is something you will wear for years as it is a timeless piece,1
8239,I couldnt wait to try on these shorts after reading all the positive reviews about them my local retailer had them in the bright blue and coral in my size and i purchased the and am content with them they are a very lightweight cool pair of shorts they do have a little stretch to them and the length is perfect i have to note they do wrinkle a bit but perfect summer staple,1
8240,This vest is so cute and flattering these pictures dont do it justice you must see it in person and try it on it only has a small percentage of wool in it so it could easily be worn in the springsummer with a tank,1
8241,The embroidery is actually navy blue not black like it shows in the photos which was even better for me these are so soft and feminine looking love love love please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer,1
8242,Love the print and loose fit doesnt look to wide on my top heavy torso and the sleeves dont cling to my chubby upper arms or tummy wore all day today first with shorts then with cropped jeans,1
8243,I love this dress it was a tad long im a shorty but i loved the cut and versatility of the material design that i took it to the tailor now it is perfect i wore it to an engagement party but i could see it going very casual or very high end depending on styling love,1
8244,I really wanted to love this dress but it just didnt fit in anyway i ordered an xs petite and it was very large the lacing in the back is completely useless and thats what i liked about the dress i was thinking it would be unlaced more at the top because of chest and then lace more tightly near the waist it was completely closed off and the dress was still very loose and unflattering beautiful fabric great color combo bad fit,0
8245,This top was much more fitted than expected and was not flattering i would not recommend,0
8246,Super cozy now that the colder weather is coming i will likely be wearing these every night relaxing at home,1
8247,This skirt is a great fit for curvy women i highly recommend it,1
8248,I just love sleeping on snow sweaters and this one is no exception its soft and cozy and very warm i do have sensitive skin so i found this a bit itchy right away but that went away after i wore it for a bit this is oversized but in a great way you could size down if you wanted something a bit more fitted sleeves are long and precuffed sweater hit me midlower thigh,1
8249,Bought this for my daughter in laws birthday its just a beautiful feminine design well made nice fabric she can wear this for work or for lunch or an evening out very versatile,1
8250,I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves and im not disappointed it is a classic t with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves it is not fitted which is what i was looking for it also covers my bum which i dont always like hanging out there in all its perfect for my needs i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too,1
8251,I love this dress the design is simple colors and patterns are eyecatching but not over the top cutting is perfect for me and very flattering the material is flowy not clingy it is a piece of easy nohassle garment that i would love to wear everyday and make it my uniform seriously it doesnt get better than that if they make more of this style with different colors and patterns i will just buy them blindlya word of caution the dress does have slightly bigger armholes so some pe,1
8252,Beautiful sweater cool enough to wear on a florida evening and it will be perfect for vacation the sleeves hit right above the wrist bone exactly as shown on the model and i really like that sheer fabric but still a sweater you will need a cami or tank underneath cant wait to wear it,1
8253,I just love this top it has a flattering cut fun summer colors i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down perfect for traveling only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back highly recommend stock more pieces like this retailer,1
8254,I usually love tops like this i bought this is the store because if was so soft got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at allwould be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in,0
8255,This is the perfect dress for summer fall winter or spring it is flattering and looks cute with booties flip flops brogues or barefoot runs a teeny bit large i wear a small to medium and the small is perfect i might just buy the other color it comes in,1
8256,Love the dress runs a little big i ordered a size down than i normally wear and it fit versatile tooi even wore it to the office with a black blazer over it and got lots of compliments,1
8257,Let me start off my saying that i hate pants i will wear dresses and skirts whenever possible to avoid them however i found these at my local retailer and just had to try them on because the pattern was so adorable i have another pair of pilcro shorts that i love because they are so comfortable and have so much stretch to them that they dont make me crazy like other pants do these were no exception i love everything about them and am going to have a hard time not wanting to wear them every,1
8258,I have a few pairs of pilcro pants and they have yet to disappoint the fit the style and the quality is just perfect for me i know i can go to my size and expect a perfect fit every time,1
8259,I love this jacket the color is what drew me to it and it looks just like the picture as far as sizing goes im usually a medium but i ordered a small and it fit well i feel that if i had ordered a medium it would look a little too puffy for my taste the small gives me a more fitted look,1
8260,This sweater in the yellow caught my eye several times and i finally tried it on so cute and perfect for transitional weather threw it over the striped top that was hanging in the changing room ended up with both,1
8261,Flattering dress that looks great on the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra the petite size fits true to size,1
8262,This hoodie has a lovely flattering drape and fits truetosize m for me and is light but quite warm the cottony nylon layers along the front panels and hood add style it will be warm enough as an outer layer on a slightly brisk day or indoors in cooler weather i was going to opt for the blue but in the store the light gray which is a bit darker and more marled than online at least on my monitor looked really lovely and seemed more versatile,1
8263,Just received this dress in the mail and im in love its beautiful and fits so well i was a little hesitant ordering a yellow dress but im so happy that i did,1
8264,This sweater is absolutely lovely i bought it in the sky color which is so pretty the picture just doesnt do it justice the yarn is super soft and it seems as though it will be plenty warm this winter i also love the retro s look a definite keeper,1
8265,This is a beautiful dress i love the bohemian style and flow works well with dressing up or dressing down very quality,1
8266,A must have sweater with great details it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion,1
8267,I purchased this dress in the raspberry for my best friends bridal shower and it was such a hit i got it for the sale price with the additional off sale items that retailer loves so much it came to i paired it with a chunky gold necklace and it was adorable so many compliments im typically a medium through and through and this fit me true to size as well between lbs the cut of the dress fit me perfectly and the material is amazing id definitely purchase this,1
8268,Got this dress in the mail today and its definitely a keeper the material is high quality and i can see wearing this dress on all but the coldest days of winter itll be great to wear today in degree weather and with a cardigan and booties it will easily transition into cool weather the colors patterns and lace are all just beautiful for reference i always order xs for loose fitting dresses and a size for close fitting styles the xs in this dress is perfect,1
8269,Good fit quality similar to the brands other jeans,1
8270,This dress is beautiful it is tts but since it is so flowy is not form fitting i am petite lbs and this is a lot of dress for a shortersmaller person if it were less flowy i would keep it the design material and overall product is however amazing this dress would be a beautiful addition to any closet,1
8271,Got this in the petite xs in mint the color is gorgeous its a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well though it would work for pretty much any skin tone its still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is and hits right around my lower hips it is a thinner fabric but thats what i was expecting and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley,1
8272,I had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale when i pulled it out of the package i could not believe how soft it was literally as a cloud think of the softest fluffiest baby blanket also the cut is extremely flattering i am lb and the medium fit me perfectly flowing but not boxy love it,1
8273,The shirt is beautiful but slightly long it is see thru and you do need to wear a cami underneath,1
8274,Love it the pants is absolutely beautiful rich material its not your cheap joggeri am really considering buying a second pair just in case i used my a little to muchfits perfect i am lbs and purchase the regular small,1
8275,First off i love the dress i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in minutes the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a dcup i ordered the and it fit perfectly except in the bust easy fix a white cami the sale price makes that necessity acceptable its a keeper,1
8276,Love the fit nice and warm and good quality material,1
8277,The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model it also has pockets which is a bonus to me i normally wear a but bought a in this dress i am a c and i felt the was a little tight across the chest otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size,1
8278,Wanted to love this i did love the color and thought the style would work for anyone but i tried it on and immediately took it off with a definite not keeping this the side zipper a complaint by many really made it uncomfortable also the detail under the bust would not lay flat and just looked odd loved the material and definitely the green print but i knew i would never wear it just looked blah,0
8279,These leggings are perfect i normally struggle to find pants that are comfortable and flattering but these are exactly what ive been looking for they are so versatile they can be worn for a lazy day in or a night on the town a new staple in my wardrobe,1
8280,I love these shorts i dont understand why they arent sold out yet they are buttery soft and fit great i usually wear a size and these are true to size they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even love,1
8281,Love this top have two of them they are comfy lightweight and extremely flattering love,1
8282,This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts jeans work well too and during cooler seasons i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warmthe fit of this top is not true to size for it runs large but is flattering on the body nonetheless the stripes and miniature circular openings i noticed add beautiful detail for formal or informal eventsas a whole this shirt is perfect the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material,1
8283,I just received this dress and i feel like a goddess in it it is perfect for graduations weddings romantic dinners tropical va cationsheck ill wear it to the grocery store i love it that muchi am with a c busti have this dress in a size and it fits very well this dress is slim cut from the shoulder down to the waist the dress length hits me at the lower calf just like the model online i think the armholes are cut a little highthis being said this dress would,1
8284,I love how comfortable this fits and the fantastic pops of color goes with just about every slip and tank dress i own a perfect lightweight dress or layering vest with my hot weather wardrobe cant wait to take this with me on vacation,1
8285,I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it really nice flow and not tent like at all and in a size i dont find this shows my stomach at all its really comfortable and i love the colors i did get this in store at off and i think its a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount,1
8286,This top is fabulous so comfy and the lace at the top is just right it does run a little big but drapes so well it looks finei got the plum but tempted to get the ivoryespecially at the sale price a steal,1
8287,Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend super flattering and soft big thumbs up,1
8288,I love this skirt unfortunately no petite sizing was available when it was affordable on sale i purchased the regular based on small waist reviews thinking ill just have it shortened did not realize there are layers and tailoring would have cost was considering anyway but when pinned up the skirt lost its fullness and i didnt care for that look if anyone has a petite they want to offload or exchange with me for a regular am very happy to do so this is one skirt i,1
8289,This precious skirt is a treasure chest of soft bronze fabric circles scattered like coins at the bottom of a fountain the circles are a bronze color and cannot be felt through the skirt net its finely finished and simply a nice piece for dinner out or a day in the office i received many compliments on my first wearing,1
8290,I am normally a but they only had the white in size so i tried it i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow therefore has plenty of fabric it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear i dont know how to explain it but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse much better in reality than on the picture,1
8291,I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket fabric is comfortably soft but the jacket is still structured love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves i wear either a small or medium i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear,1
8292,I really like this top while it looks somewhat like just a tshirt it is not the fabric is light and soft it has a great texture feel it dioes not feel like a regular cotton shirt the print is lovely i am very pleased,1
8293,Purchased in the light grey and was so excited i wore it the very next day the back detailing and pocket make it more unique than a regular tee and the fabric is slightly heavy in a good way so it hangs beautifully easily can be dressed up or down new favorite tee,1
8294,These are flattering and the colors are really nice theyre a bit tighter than other pilcro pants ive tried but the material is stretchy,1
8295,This top is a cross between a shirt and sweater great length and very soft it does run a little large so size down if you are n the fence hangs nicely in the back,1
8296,Ive got the postbaby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest ive looked in a long time fitted but skimming where i dont want to be accentuated its a rare dress that can pull this off the cleavage is there so i think its more of a night dress but id wear it with a sweater during the day very comfortable,1
8297,I love this dress i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun i would have never picked this dress out i didnt look awesome on the hanger but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time but i couldnt stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress so i did what any girl would do and bought it online it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesnt do the dres,1
8298,So happy with this jacket i have looked for what feels like forever for a vegan leather jacket that is long enough in the sleeves and wide enough in the shoulders without being bulky through the body i found it ran true to size my usual large for well xl was a little big the material is beautiful and soft and the colors are great i ordered the honey and cognac and love them both,1
8299,I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes i always wear a medium but sized down to a small based on the other review the seams are very flattering the material is very soft on sale the price is reasonable,1
8300,I really love this top they show its as a bathing suit cover up in the pics but i will wear mine as a top over a cami its beautiful and looks expensive it is had to exchange my usual size for one smaller,1
8301,This dress looked ok in the hanger but oh my on was so much better quality is great i love the fabric and that it has pocketsim and normally a ddd usually a large tooso i worried about the size the medium fits great everywhere,1
8302,I love this jacket it has great structure and lays nicely while still have knit arms and a lining dont try this on if you arent prepared to buy it because its amazing color is more of an olive than a khaki to me as it appears in this picture i am lbs c and the small fit perfectly definitely consider this as an investment piece across many seasons,1
8303,The perfect tee this is exactly what i have been looking for flattering fitlooks great dressed up or down and has just a touch of unique detail without being over the top the top is just slightly thin but can definitely be worn without a cami underneath this reminds me of old retailer tops from several years ago that i just loved and wore to death,1
8304,This dress is as cute as represented in the picture the adjustable ties on the sides allow your dress to be form fitting or a looser more casual look the colors of the dress and the beading are beautiful the dress looks great paired with a pair of black ankle boots,1
8305,This skirt is so cozy and comfortable it is form fitting but has a lot of givestretch the material feels high quality and heavy without being overly hot i am sure this will be a go to skirt,1
8306,I loved the look of this sweater but the workmanship was surprisingly poor there were missed stitches and loose threads throughout and even a tag sewn to the outside retailer was great about the return i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed,0
8307,Im not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small in my opinion it runs pretty large i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small i do have a small bust b and skinny arms so maybe thats why regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket,1
8308,Im so glad that i took a chance on these theyre fabulous i wasnt sure about sizing since my local store didnt carry them but as a widerhipped i went with the xl it was the perfect fit and i couldnt be more pleased the skirt is the perfect touch since it gives my flat booty the illusion of shape and provides a little coverage not that youd need it theres no showthrough whatsoever love,1
8309,Absolutely love this dress it is perfect for the summer yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is the style is so unique love the pleats i am lbs dd and the size fits perfectly not tight through the arms holes or the bust area the dress hangs perfectly you can dress it up or where it to run errands,1
8310,This dress is everything i imagined it would be lightweight flattering on my hourglass shape and comfortable i am a true p in retailer dresses d inch waist denim size and purchased this dress in a regular i imagine the petite size would be way too short as the regular size hit about inches above my knee might be a problem for taller girls definitely size up on this one to avoid button gaping,1
8311,I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small i have to totally disagree with the reviewer i find that this top runs true to size or even generous the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit broad shoulders lb,1
8312,I really am happy with this purchase i am only and this will be a perfect dress for me the cuts hit at just the right spot,1
8313,Love it this suit is high quality and comfortable its a little tricky to get on but once its on its perfect i have a small chest and the fit of the cups and twisted fabric makes me feel totally comfortable i usually wear two pieces in fact this is my first one piece since i was ten and i love it,1
8314,This top is beautiful it is comfortable soft and relaxed without being baggy colors are just as seen on the websiteif not prettier it is a versatile and flattering top tucked in or not sleeves rolled up or not i love it,1
8315,Im either a medium or large in retailer tops i was able to wear a medium in this top the color is vibrant and the material is soft and light it will be a great spring and summer top cant wait to wear it,1
8316,This tee is a great everyday staple it is comfortable and it also drapes very well i am ft in lbs b and i got this in xxs regular the length is perfect for leggingsskinny jeans and it also looks really cute with a side knot in front i have this is navy green and black the navy color is brighter in person and in my opinion looks better you cant go wrong planning on getting the grey and pink one as well,1
8317,This is the weirdest greatest material it feels as soft and as buttery as leather but doesnt look like leather it looks more like coated denim only lighter and stretchy so you dont get the vibe you get from the vast majority of vegan leatherthick rubbery junk trying to masquerade as the real thingalso gorgeous the cut its straight and slim but with pleats so hipless ladies like me look like we have some shapei got my regular size and they fit beautifully but they are not,1
8318,Love these pants the design is totally different and that is what i love i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site also on sale for me these ran true to size,1
8319,I purchased this for a late summer wedding that i was invited to last minute and i cant wait to wear it i got it on sale with an additional percentage off and for the price it is a steal like all of tracy reese designs it is so cute and feminine it runs just a tad bit on the larger side so the medium fit my size figure perfectly i tried on the large and it was too big and too long for me the medium length was perfect for my height,1
8320,This is soft to the touch and just beautifulit is a little roomy but true to size i love it that way totally on trend for the season,1
8321,Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved wish i would have bought all the other colors,1
8322,This dress is gorgeous i love it i bought it to wear to a july wedding i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color the sizing is on spot i slipped it on and it was comfortable easy and stylish i am and typically xs it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight i am in love,1
8323,This is such a great top that when my cat snagged it i bought a second version to wear in public and kept the snagged version to wear around the house or for working out it is super comfortable and can be worn with so many things definitely on the more casual side but you can dress it up slightly w jeans and booties or it can be worn w leggings jeans and tennis shoes etc i also bought the coral color in addition to the blue if youre on the fence i would say you cant go wrong with buyi,1
8324,This is a great light weight tank true to size but size up if you prefer a baggier fit size down for a closer fit your preference for fit should be your guide i prefer a closer fit so i choose a xs i am a in tops the arm holes are slim and high so you are completely covered in all sizes excellent drape the twist in the front is just perfect looks great with jeans print joggers and even wide leg pants i imagine it would be fantastic with a pencil skirt denim perhaps hope it,1
8325,Quality is great fits very well at waste i am lb bought size p and its good i would require wear heels as it reaches and sits on the floor they are more fallspringwinter pants as material quite thick overall i am happy with them,1
8326,I ordered this in an xs and it fits well however if you have a bigger bust this top may be a problem i wear a b cup and it fits me well,1
8327,Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater true to size i am and lb and both the small and medium fit i kept the medium love it,1
8328,This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream the dark black patterned top is not seethrough which means you can easily wear it without having to layer the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flatteringthe doubledup buttons makes the blouse unique and its comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall,1
8329,Love the jacket so versatile would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit,0
8330,Before i ordered this i noted the other reviews that said it was sheer but thought i would just wear a layer underneath unfortunately it was one of the sheerest fabrics ive ever seen would love it if it could have been a more substantial fabric to me it wasnt worth the money even on sale,0
8331,I think of tracy reese as running small and usually size up but the was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage so you need the right bra,1
8332,I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic i love it the material is super soft and it fits nicely snug but not too tight the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering i got the black one but i am going to get more colors great buy,1
8333,I really wanted to love this but it was just too voluminous to be flattering i am typically a size or in dresses and jumpsuits and the medium was billowing around me alsothe elastic waist hit me low and bunched in an unflattering way it had to go back,0
8334,I received this jacket in an fits great with room i am a dd chest for reference as i was not sure if i needed a but the is perfect see my pictures as i feel the website photos are more bright as the actual jacket is more muted buttons are very nice but the pocket flaps hit right at the boob area so it my bother some very high quality lined and will look great over some retailer dresses in the same color way i purchased last year depending on the season this jacket would do fine,1
8335,Nice chunky knit cotton tank with cutout shoulders sporty looking armholes are the right size and bra doesnt show no holes to see through even in white tts i took my usual medium falls to about hip bone approx from shoulder not tight not baggy but has a nice comfortable drape i got in white best to put it on before applying makeup this goes great with black and white print pilazzo pants love this top,1
8336,Very flattering suit embroidery is unique and the cut flatters,1
8337,Gorgeous pattern even prettier in person runs slightly large in my opinion could size down nice to have as a petite option,1
8338,Lovely dress in bright teal color the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned unfortunately i sized up based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size the fabric does have a bit of stretch so im really not sure why so many people had sizing issues this is really a great buy with the current sale tempted to pick up the red version too,1
8339,These are the perfect vintagelooking high rise jeans without the risk inherent in buying vintage for reference i am lbs and usually a in ag these fit me perfect in a size and were a great length for booties and flats they fit me at versus above the ankle,1
8340,This top completely fell short for me i was so excited for it to arrive yesterday and upon opening the package i knew immediately that it was not what i was expecting in the images online there seam up the middle of the shirt isnt even noticeable but in person it is very prominentand not in a good way the peplum is a lot fuller then pictured as well did not work well with my large bust d returned,0
8341,I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product its terrible it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide the skirt is also not like the picture its darker and heavier the material isnt great i had to return,0
8342,Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering not to boxy hits at the hip and drapes nice great for work or with jeans i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow,1
8343,Oh how i love moth sweaters but wow was this one a disappointment the color is wonderful the shape is unique and the stitch work is lovely but thats where the compliments end its an itchy cheap feeling acrylic that is too short for my torso i am truly disappointed that at this price point it was such a cheap feeling piece so bummed so so bummed,0
8344,True to form this retailer sweater hits the mark its light weight stylish great for a shorter person like myself and has cute detailing the sleeves are little long but i push them up anyway and the cream color i bought goes with everything the xs size is more comfortable and flattering than the s if you are short i would have bought the bluish gray color of this sweater too but already own a similarly shaded and textured sweater from retailer from last yearlove that one,1
8345,This flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line simply stunning was reluctant to pay high price but worth it will get much wear,1
8346,Size always c and i have broad shouldersi found this true to size the colors pop more and there is a cleavage alert just letting you girls know this is very figure flattering especially with my body frame it accentuates the right spots,1
8347,I love this top i got the blue the colors are deep and just beautifulim normally a large so i feel this top runs large i got the medium and it fits perfect it is long im and it hits the bottom of my butt you wont be disappointed try this top,1
8348,I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it i get many compliments on this top i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls,1
8349,I saw this sweater at the store and instantly love it it run large i am and pounds and usually a size s in most retailer tops i had to go with xxs on this one so def size down,1
8350,There may be no inner lining but it is a gorgeous bra and so comfortable the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning it is absolutely true to size c fit like a glove a winner,1
8351,I purchased this dress in the green and while the print and material were lovely the extra folds in the neckline made the dress look frumpy up top the billowly bottom made it look like a bag i am ft d and waist and the size fit which makes me think this runs large ill be returning this dress,0
8352,I love this top it is long enough for my torso and arms i am thinking of ordering in another color,1
8353,This top is too boxy and has too much going on it should have no buttons or different ones,0
8354,Nice quality details and i like the looser cut works well on this blouse,1
8355,I got a m in this top and was a little scared but i absolutly love this top i was debating on it and then caught it on the off sale my first retailer purchase and it definitely wont be my last great quality so comfortable and very cute,1
8356,I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests i ordered the burgundy color in an xs my usual and the color is lovely and deep i absolutely love it the ribbed design is comfortable the neck drapes as shown so it is not constricting at all,1
8357,Love love love this skirt i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute once i tried it on i fell in love i purchased both black and blue super flattering and true to size its a must have for sure,1
8358,This is the perfect duster transitions you perfectly from summer to fall without being an overly heavy piece simple and classic i know i will get a lot of wear out of this item,1
8359,My local retailer had one of these skirts in store presumably a return i was so excited when i found out that it was in my size im and usually a or at retailer and bought the for reference the skirt is made of a heavy fabric and the pockets are lined with paisley fabric the seams look really sturdy and the skirt moves well its very cute and super easy to wear i styled it with brown boots an retailer belt and a white button down great for springsummer xx,1
8360,I grabbed this dress in green when i saw it on sale plus there was an additional percentage off that day online and they had my size while its slightly loose in the body of the dress that will probably tighten up after the first wash since its rayon then it should fit like a glove i didnt experience the zipper issue there is a hook eye at the top to keep the fabric together and the zipper was stiff so it wont unzip of its own volition it is a tad bulky at the top of the zipper w,1
8361,I love the color combo and the design make me feel tall and thin i know this is going to be very cool to wear on a hot day i like it with my white jeans and you can wear it a number of ways i love this brand i still wear the plaid from last spring its a got to have,1
8362,I could wear this every day it is stylish and comfortable,1
8363,I got this top in the black and i love it the bottom is a silky material thats really beautiful and the cutout details are really pretty so many of retailers sweaters are enormous but this one fits tts my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily,1
8364,I meant to order both red and blue and added to red in my basket by accident oops meant to be the color is very nice not too bright holiday red but nice rich red the cut is very flattering too i didnt expect to love it as much on i ordered the xxs p length was not too highcropped perfect the asymmetrical hem gives some visual interest to the sweater so does the fun neckline with keyhole on the side fun take on a sweater for me the fabric was comfortable i am lbs dd,1
8365,I found this piece very boxy and not very feminine i tried to make it work but i just wasnt feeling it the material is thin and the design is boring unfort it wasnt for me,0
8366,I almost always return dresses after trying them at home but not this one i love it and cant wait to get it back from the dry cleaner the shoulders are really stylish and the dress is super comfortable it has pockets which is also a bonus i told my husband that i want to bring it to a seamstress and have it duplicated in another fabric because i love it so much,1
8367,The dress is absolutely beautiful in person the blue stripes are a bit brighter and the print on top is more muted its unique and sure to turn heads being i tried on the small petite this size is usually perfect lengthwise for me however this dress was about too long another complaint is the style of the top half the model in the picture seems to be hiding the puffiness of the top half the top half puffs out and made me appear much wider than i am not a good look on anyone,0
8368,Perfect for end of summer going into fall very soft and pairs great with skinnies and sandals or booties still trying to find a sweater to layer it with runs true to size i am an xs and got the xs i was a little worried because i am so petite i usually swim in tops like this it fits perfectly and comfortably,1
8369,What an adorable and frustrating skirt im not a large person d and i ordered my normal size small this is a pull on skirt and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips in most retailer clothes im either a size or i have to agree with the other reviewer there is no way to put this item on,0
8370,I bought it in black and cream great weight soft fabric beautiful lace,1
8371,Love this white jean jacket love the stretchy fit,1
8372,I purchased this and another eva franco dress during retailers recent off sale i was looking for dresses that were work appropriate but that would also transition well to happy hour or date night they both seemed to be just what i was looking for i ordered a regular and a regular as i am usually in between sizes the was definitely too small the fit technically but was very ill fitting not only is the dress itself short but it is very shortwaisted i am only but it fe,0
8373,Cute top fits short but roomy will get a lot of use in my wardrobe,1
8374,Adorable peasant fitting top not too voluminous just right for over jeans and really cute with shorts the detail makes it wearable for dress up or down and the cut is classic,1
8375,I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms thank you retailer i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts,1
8376,This shirt is extremely soft and fits well great length and perfect casual shirt for fall,1
8377,Gorgeous suit one of the most well made suits ive ever owned sexy yet provides great coverage do note the sizing is per australian standards i had to order a size up,1
8378,Love this dress i cant say enough about it comfortable stylish packable doesnt wrinkle at all i love it i bought the neutral and the turquoise only planned on keeping one but i love it so much im keeping both good dress for fallwinter to wear with flats or tights and boots can easily be dressed up or worn casual i am lbs and bought the xs petite perfect fit a great price point especially with the off dresses,1
8379,This top is a perfect example of why retailer is heaven the attention to detail is stunning and it drapes beautifully i am and lbs with an average build an xs fits me perfectly this top is very flowy i could wear it until about six months into a pregnancy yet it is flattering even though i am not currently adding to the human race its an investment but its high quality and worthy of the price tag,1
8380,This top may be labeled as a part of a sleep set but i threw a cami under it styled it with skinny jeans and a top knot and this became a very effortlesschic so cal look love that pop of hot pink too i went up a size for a little extra wiggle room across my shoulders overall this is a great summer top,1
8381,I love the fit of these pants theyre the perfect slim black pants however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places disappointed by the workmanshipquality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and dont sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product,0
8382,I hadnt seen this sweaterjacket online or in store before shopping today i purchased the ivory it fits without being bulky whether or not it is zipped great fit true to sizethe asymmetric zipper is a stylish detail the pockets are well placed also it is a perfect spring weight jacket or i suspect a comfy fall to winter sweater,1
8383,Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece but the quality is below average for an retailer dress its just a shapeless thin beach coverup that i couldve picked up anywhere the yellow color is so cute though if youre looking for a light breezy gotothebeach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel this might be good for you but its too thin for just about anything else,0
8384,Love this tee lightweight airy and comfy i think it fits true to size so soft and summery cant wait to wear it this summer,1
8385,Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point,1
8386,You do not want to know how many cropped wideleg jeans ive tried on all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasonsits not easy to get this style right apparently these are great comfy make my legs look cute not chopped off they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh why do some do that they act like trousers with a jeans casual edge the let out hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse stylesi bought,1
8387,This is adorable but if it truly has to be drycleaned that is deal killer,0
8388,The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye so perfect for the fall season i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine got compliments the first time i wore it so glad they restocked in my size as they had been sold out,1
8389,I couldnt resist this basic white button down with the cute side buttons that added some interest i bought my usual size large and it fit perfectly the soft substantial fabric from cloth and stone never disappoints i love the longer cut since im and love a long shirt to hide the belly pudge the blue is darker than the online picture shows and ill probably be going back for that but at almost im hoping itll go on sale,1
8390,I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop i am b lbs and the xs fit perfectly since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under andor very short waisted the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all eveningand got tons of compliments as well,1
8391,I wore this top right out of the package i loved it so much i am small busted and size was great the sleeves hit me perfectly the pleated detail in the back is flattering as well my daughter now wants her own top it would be nice to have a second color option,1
8392,Love love this piece for the moment i saw it i noted anther catalog i knew i had to try it on im and and the xs fits me perfectly i love the way it is tailored it is also lined with a nice fabric overall a very well made summer go to piece,1
8393,I saw this in the store and immediately loved it even before trying on the style is classic and the fit is perfect the material is soft and comfortable it hugs without clinging i tried on the black in s and the green in xs and went with the green different shoes and accessories will dress this up or down i plan to travel with it several times this summer it will be a great option to wear on the plane and arrive looking chic,1
8394,The turquoise print is absolutely stunning i love the feel of the fabric the drape,1
8395,I bought the green pair in store and loved their fit i ended up buying the rust color online too im and i went down a size to a cause they will stretch a little perfect length for my height too great with wedges or boots,1
8396,Many thanks to all previous reviewers that convinced me to try this blazer i bought it in navy and it is absolutely perfect i love its simple lines softness and quality of the material it transitions easily from work to casual i paired it with mirabella lace top and skinny jeans for a look that is both practical and beautiful,1
8397,These joggers are gorgeousyou can even dress them up the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flatteringreally i knew the minute i saw them i would love them but i do have to say that the lovely modelwearing them the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag i bought that tooand that big smile sold me many thanks to retailerpersonal stylists carolyn and blair always so helpfu,1
8398,I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip i already had my outfits planned when these pants arrived however they were very different from those shown in the pictures online firstly the pants are in actuality quite cropped i am the model in the pictures is at least that height if not taller and the hems were several inches above my ankles secondly the pants appear to be an even wider cut than whats shown although the width of the pant legs may have,0
8399,I purchased this top in an antro store last week the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders but can be removed by snaps i tooks great when worn two different ways i wore it with the campole out and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom it also looks great when the camisole is worn in my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as its a touch big at the shoulders and neckli,1
8400,I agree with the other reviews perfect color and weight to the dress should wear well in summer and fall im c lbs athletic and got the regular fit well and the length was perfect with flats,1
8401,Great little summer jacket that takes the place of a jean jacket i am not usually fond of olive green but this is a bit deeper than a drab olive without being too green it is sooo soft and comfortable that i find i am pairing it with all sorts of outfits fits tts if you are going for the look on the model not too fittedi highly recommend this timeless piece,1
8402,I saw the shirt on the retailer website and new i had to have it when it arrived it was perfectly draped light and airy and incredibly soft and comfortable its perfect to throw on with yoga pants for errands or dress up a bit a casual night out with friends would buy this again in several different colors if they were offered,1
8403,I bought an retailer cami years ago and it is still in good shape so i looked on the website to see if they still carried them and they did i bought i was so excited,1
8404,Love love love this top i saw this online and immediately knew tha tthis had to be in my wardrobe i wear a lot of navyin my estimating the classiest color there isblack is passe it is simple very wearable with pants with skirts the very thin stripe adds interest without really being a pattern that conflicts with other patterns i did have an issue with some threads that were randomly hanging from sleeve cuffbut nothing important yes it is croppedvery much so so if,1
8405,Great design beautiful colors well fitted got compliments,1
8406,This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details i purchased this in purple which is actually more of a cranberry color i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves,1
8407,Little boxy in the mid section very very elegant and beautiful design,1
8408,These are the perfect wide legs they arent overly wide a common problem for petite women like myself who cannot pull off the really wide styles and they are nicely fitted in the top the fabric is a great weight neither too heavy nor too light so they lay nicely the similar level linen wide legs with the waist ties have a much lighter fabric that doesnt lay right and i like these hei hei pants much better i said they run large because i tend the fluctuate between p and p a,1
8409,Warning its totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless youre very confident in your midsection you can wear a bandeau or just a bra its definitely a lounge leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out its lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top i live in this over the weekends i am a larger gal broader shoulder and purchased an xl its true to size and roomy,1
8410,Asadvertised crop sweater is a great length design is an ironon velvet texture rather than intarsia weight of sweater is great for transitional weather,1
8411,I love sundry clothing this lightweight fleece is the perfect weight it keeps you warm enough when its cold but not hot when it is milder its super soft with nice embroidery size is a great fit for my frame wear it to hang at home or to go out,1
8412,I purchased the blue and i love the style and fit of the shirt i worry a bit about the slit showing too much cleavage in certain positions but my friends have assured me that it is work appropriate very flattering and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it,1
8413,This blouse is a disappointment fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off just odd sleeves awkward the back of the white shirt on the online model is not the same as the white shirt i received mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white no ruffle returned,0
8414,I am obsessed with these shorts i bought blue ones last year and loved them so much i needed another pair i purchased the gray ones and they are a beautiful hue even with my pale legs i think they will be very versatile the fit is perfect hits at just the right length to be flattering and appropriate not too short super comfy i am fuller on the bottom so shorts are tough to find and these are truly amazing i cant wait to wear them when it gets warmer for reference i am about,1
8415,I adore this maxi the fit style pattern black motif machine washability everything fits tts got my usual size s for lbs i would say that the length is appropriate some are super long on me and im not one to wear heels i was also happy that the top fits nice and snug my issue is usually that when i bend forward the top drapes open due to my small chest no problem with this dress i think its perfect piece for springsummerfall and dressing up or down my one slight,1
8416,I saw this classic beauty on a mannequin with black trousers and it looks gorgeous so i went back to try it on looks better on vs on the tablei have broad shoulders and the small worked,1
8417,As another reviewer pointed out although the tag inside the dress says that you can machine wash in cold water the color around the popsicles will bleed this is extremely disappointing im hoping it can either be fixed with dye remover or that retailer will take this item back would only dry clean this item,0
8418,A very versatile and cozy top would look great dressed up or down for a casual comfy fall day what a fun piece for my wardrobe,1
8419,This skirt is soft and comfortable breathes and moves really nicely great quality and fabric just be careful in the first wear i snagged a spot with my rings i ordered my usual medium but probably could have sized down to a small i plan to wear this all the time,1
8420,I saw this dress on someone and knew immediately i had to have it it is stunning in person,1
8421,This top is absolutely gorgeous i ordered in xs and unfortunately could not button it too tight for reference i am lbs b i will definately be exchanging it for a size s i just love how classy and glamorous this top is i do wish it were a few inches longer but it still looks so nice i agree with other reviewer how nice it will go over a cocktail dress hoping the size s has a better fit on me,1
8422,Love this top such a pretty color and so comfy sleeves are a bit long but fits pretty true like most left of center washes and dries in the dryer very nicely,1
8423,This is a cute dress but not for me i think it runs very small it is super textured so if you dont want to add bulk aka pounds to your frame this probably isnt for you its too bad its online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first im sure its probably adorable on smaller thinner people unfortunately mine is going back,0
8424,Comfortable great fit and beautiful colors the interesting thing is that in this picture it shows the dress just below the knee i am so totally average height but the dress falls just above my ankles which i personally think is way more attractive not sure if there are two versions of this dress but be careful if you buy online i got mine in the glendale store,1
8425,I love these pants i saw them and had to have them i love the classic plaid style and have always loved the bluegreen combination i purchased the fisherman sweater and saw these pants and new it would be a hit get compliments on this combo all the time,1
8426,I bought this in every color and would probably keep buying it if there were others the fit is loose yet flattering quality is good feminine pretty ruffles that dont add bulk and i love that it makes me feel pretty and puttogether postbaby,1
8427,I am obsessed with the off the shoulder trend this season i were mind on the shoulders so its work appropriate and you can still tuck it in the length is perfect the colors are awesome t paired it with a pair of pilco cords it easily work with a skirt or dress pantsi would highly recommend,1
8428,When the top arrived and i tried it on it was great the length was perfect even though i am curvy after one wash done according to the directions the top shrank in length considerably i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of qualityi do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use i will be returning this item,0
8429,I tried this on xs and thought it would be great butit was simply bog on me and boxy unfortunately they are out of petite in the grey color my favorite of the this top is soft and feminine if it fits properly but too big was a little too boxy,1
8430,I love everything about this tunic the color fabric and design i am very happy with this perches,1
8431,This is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical it doesnt itch which is key at least for me i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long i think the neckline is unique,1
8432,This tee shirt is just adorable i found it at a local retailer and decided to try it on and just loved it i happened to walk out of my dressing room while wearing it to talk to my daughter who was shopping with me and three customers in the hall said that is so cute and went to find their own i bought the ivory color but the other colors are really nice as wellthe fabric is substantial soft and thick the little ruffle at the shoulder makes a cute statement but is just fun and not,1
8433,Im a petite girl and lbs ordered regular size xs since others mentioned this being short or cropped this sweater is adorable not itchy in my opinion and the lenght is just right not short not long however it may be a bit short for tall girlsstill think its worth a try,1
8434,I ordered size small i am b the fabric is super soft and the fit is great theres an adorable little quote on the panties lining and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining the feel of the lace and fabric is divine love it one more thing to notethere is very little lining in the bra really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric it is enough to protect modesty but not much else,1
8435,I love love love these jeans they fit like a dream and the fabric is so soft and giving the waist comes up higher and stays snug which means no muffin top plus they look awesome i truly hope paige comes out with more like this,1
8436,I live in south florida so im always looking for sundresses that will be flattering but not too clingy or hot and that i can take from day to evening with accessories when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it it met all my criteria and as an added bonus my husband said wow you look great whered you get that dress im shocked because as an earlier reviewer said this dress doesnt seem like much its not even lined but its comfy flattering in all the right pla,1
8437,Now i wouldve been scared off by the fabrics had i not seen the cute flattering cut if this spring top love the futuristic look of the fabric and style brought back by the rise design throughout like the previous reviewer claims this top is even cuter on us non models who are pry not as washed out the color combo is another positive because its both flattering and versatile,1
8438,I am a shorter woman and typically a size large i purchased this dress in a large it is flattering and fits well good length as well,1
8439,Thrilled that this not only fits great on me but i got it at a deep sale price all the problems that the negative reviewers had did not apply to me at all im so glad i gave this a try my body is large on top with a square waist a bit of a tummy no hips or bum and the medium petite skimmed over all my flaws and made me look more proportionate not sure why this is called halter though i am dd wide torso size jeans,1
8440,This is great just to have and throw onit is a everyday piece,1
8441,Denim faux fur flannel hooray i absolutely love this jacket and ill wear it all winter even under my warmer winter coat im and usually a in retailer and the small in this coat was plenty big in the waistchest and even had room underneath to add a second shirt or light sweater it seems a little shorter on me than in the photo maybe thats the only drawback,1
8442,This is a problem i have had with the pilcro hyphen cargos with the color dyethe dyes in these pants are the same thing i wore the purple color and washed in cold gentle cycle and they were stained i will return these its too bad because they were pretty comfortable and flattering pants,0
8443,I purchased the orange version definitely orange not red before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person the fabric is very soft and hangs well look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan i own a few akemi akin tops and always get a s this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s,1
8444,So i almost returned this top without trying it on because ive been binging on tops with thin blue lines but so glad i didnt im busty like ddd and i weigh but i got the and it fits like a glove perfection plus i got it on sale so fab,1
8445,I really love this dress its very flattering and comfortable and all the buttons keep the wrap in check ive gotten lots of compliments on it also its got pockets,1
8446,I absolutely love this top it can be worn with shorts or jeans dressed up or down it fits perfectly i am broad on top so i ordered a large i bought it in whitei wish they had more colors love it,1
8447,This sweater is so lovely i like the fact that its not super heavy so you can be comfortable with a layer under it the embroidery is beautiful i usually get petite sizes when available but the petite m was sold out when i purchased i went with regular medium and am actually glad its not overwhelming or too long im in my opinion if youre on the fence go for it totally worth it,1
8448,Super easy and cute i received lots of compliments,1
8449,This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan love this shirt,1
8450,I tried this on in my regular size and was able to get it on fine but the cup portion of the suit was just crazy with the straps tied tightly around my neck it was like the cups just flipped out and open i am a regular b cup and i dont think it was sizing though i did not have the opportunity to try multiple sizes the cup did not right and for this reason would make this absolutely impossible to wear unfortunate because the design is so pretty,0
8451,Very flattering i am c and short torso and the small fit like a glove the medium was a bit loose and gapped some on the side of my breasts need to wear strapless bra really cute style and goes with several of the patterned capri pants i bought at retailer this spring,1
8452,I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans the pants are so comfortable and flattering love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up i am in my s and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age retailer is my favorite store,1
8453,I have tried this on several times now and have yet to pull the trigger i like the coral color the best for its versatility the detailing on this cardigan is fantastic i especially like the back the stitching is already very flattering but then the pleats really add an extra touch the only reason i have not bought it yet is that i wish it was slightly longerespecially with it being a cashmere piece i am slightly worried about it shrinking in any way which would make it much too short an,1
8454,I got this online in a sale and couldnt wait to try it on at home its so cute the fabric is a great print and the fit is swingy which i love i have a larger bust than waist and im lbs i ordered my normal size and it fit perfectly i cant wait to wear it with booties this fall,1
8455,Ok so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear ill have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these first they are so so comfortable soft material stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering im lbs curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size there is a little bit of room which im happy with so they dont squeeze the love handle area or make it unco,1
8456,This jacket feels like quality and has beautiful detailing one thing to note though the proportions are a little odd it is cut very high in the back at the waist and the sleeves seem overlong,1
8457,This top is way cuter in real life it looks a little frumpy on the model but t is very flattering on the sleeves are split so not a warm top but this will be a nice transitional piece i am always looking for interesting but classy tops to war to work and this fits the bill,1
8458,dd in tops in bottomsthis tank is amazing the flowing aline shape is very flattering the armholes are perfect all too often i see a good tank top ruined by large gaping armholes no bra peekaboo here fabric is a stretch microrib knit that doesnt cling too tightly just enough to give the top good definition i took the size large for the length just past the hips on me the side slits keep the look flowy the light blue contrast color is light grey while the brigh,1
8459,So this is available in the store in a reddish coral color see the your retailer pictures and youll see someone wearing it under the gray blazer anyway i tried it on and the fit was very flattering for a tunic the front of the sweater hit me just at the waist and the front draped nicely somehow the back was slightly hugging my back side but not tight or restricted i ended up ordering the black and navy online because the fit was fantastic and will go with so many things nothing shee,1
8460,I love this sweater the green is soft the fabric is light enough for year round in my area i thought it might be too young but it works nicely for me i bought it in two other colors when the package arrived today,1
8461,This blouse does run large especially in the length of the sleeves but the rest of the shirt fit well pretty pretty blouse hides bulges runs a little long super soft material a must have for fall,1
8462,There arent enough great words to describe this dress tried on the black one in store yesterday and knew immediately i was going to purchase everything is perfection not tight slip underneath that even has the strap snap closures to hold it in place at the shoulders not too low cut hits right above knee so not too short light weight flattering etc and machine washable can dress up or down could even wear to work with a jacket or cardi can wear all seasons cant wait to pair wi,1
8463,I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits its is versatile and figure flattering i only buy timeless pieces that i know wont go out of style and this vest fits the bill,1
8464,Heavier fabric than it looks but cute and versatile flattering as well,1
8465,I loved this tunic dress up or down layer it with a cropped leather jacket and booties i bit on the long side so if you are short it might make you look stumpy but really cute with leggings or skinny jeans,1
8466,Very cozy wrap the material is so soft find myself grabbing this anytime i am chilly day and night i offen find my daughter wrapped up in it too and with the arm holes it stays on very pleased,1
8467,I love this dress and will be purchasing it in other patterns the fit is incredibly flattering and the fabric is lovely doesnt wrinkle easy to wash and wear i am lbs bottom heavy with a c bra size i purchased the size large and it fits me perfectly though perhaps a little bit snug in the waist if i wanted a looser fit an xl would probably work though might be a bit loose on the top the low back hits just above my bra strap but does in fact cover all straps for reference,1
8468,I did not like the fit of this as another reviewer stated it is not a swing tunic it hangs fairly straight i dont have large hips im and lbs with a full bust and this did not look flattering i returned it immediately,0
8469,I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding it is absolutely gorgeous the actual fabric is much more detailed in person sizing is accurate the dress is knee length there is a little tulle underneath to give it the aline shape,1
8470,Really cute and comfortable i have worn these a couple of times and get several compliments worth every penny and now they are on sale,1
8471,I just received this top and love it the fabric is soft and comfy it is just as pictured no surprises laceup fronts are a hot item for spring for reference i am and weigh the xs fits perfectly,1
8472,Very disappointed in this top i have a short waist and it was still too short for me,0
8473,I tried this on twice in nyc and loved this jacket it is so much cuter in person my only concern is whether the mesh fabric will hold up over time and at this price point it needs to last more than one season it has adorable embroidery on it the colors are vibrant you need to see this in person,1
8474,This dress is so beautiful in person i actually am currently wearing it with jeans and i get so many compliments on it this picture on the website does not really do it justice very flowy beautiful topdress,1
8475,Love ag jeans a little on the pricey sidebut so worth it the harper style is just enough higher wasted so i can actually bend over and not worry about anyone seeing anything other than my jeans but not too high waisted these jeans keep their shape still with a little strestch to them i am and lbs and if not wearing under boots would have to a alter or b wear as these are in the picture because theyd be too long for me but i would purchase these all over again love these,1
8476,This top arrived today and after trying it on i wanted to leave a review to say that the shirt is without a doubt pinned back on the model in the product picture the fit is designed to be loose so i dont think anyone could possibly get the same look as the model even if they sized down ive included a picture of how it fits naturally and a picture of how it fits the model as i hold the fabric back its still a cute shirt just not the flattering top i was expecting im debating on,0
8477,Hi i love this top it not only is femine but it is wee bit sexy it could be worn in the office then out for happy hour,1
8478,I just got this after ordering online and i was pleasantly surprised the cardigan has the structure of a lightweight jacket so it creates a flattering silhouette i ordered it in a medium and even though im curvy on top it fits really nicely,1
8479,Cute and comfy shirt tts got my usual m im a and it has a generous fit but i think its supposed to its actually a silver grey color,1
8480,This dress is everything i love about retailer a nevercouldhaveguessedit feminine textured twist on a classic its beautiful its comfortable the cut is true to size for me and figure flattering,1
8481,Im which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer former employee and while the bodice hit right the skirt was insanely long not even with heels is this gonna be right and no discount towards hemming ill wait until this hits the sale rack which it will because concensus is its way too long,0
8482,This dress is everything i hoped it would be flattering cute cozy,1
8483,Incredibly flattering and going to be useful for multiple occasions i needed a default black dress and this is itonly downside its pictured with a beautiful grosgrain ribbon at the waist but does not actually come with the ribbon ill be trying to find something similar at a ribbonembroidery shop as the dress would really benefit from a slightly cinched waist,1
8484,This is probably my current favorite dress it is beautiful comfortable and flattering i wear it with swept up hair and delicate earnings,1
8485,These are my new favorite pair of jeans very flattering particularly on the bum the wash is great dark and slightly distressed with a frayed hem at the ankle the leg is straight rather than super skinny which i am really enjoying as of late fyi i am usually a size in denim but went down to a in this style,1
8486,I needed a legging to wear with boots makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings try to find warm leggingsalmost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot,1
8487,These ag stevie ankle jeans only have cottontthe rest is lyocell a rayon polyester and polyurethane result thin and clingy jeans that show every lump and stretch out these are no longer the same lovely ags in twill when they were at cotton modal pu it seems ag has also stopped making denim and corduroy with cotton at least in the steviesim sure these will be a great choice for someone looking for very soft and thin pants that feel like pjs b,0
8488,I got lots of compliments on this dress as expected the arm holes are a little large meaning low but other than that i love it,1
8489,This could seriously fit a large and its an xs so frustrating this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous i get the whole loose fit style but seriously youve taken it to a whole new level retailer another trip to the store to return another item a complete waste of my time ugh,0
8490,This is a very fitted dress i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry jacket even a large sweater over the top tts i definitely would not recommend sizing down im a and the med is right for me,1
8491,Ive always been a pilcro fan and they always seem to fit just right this pair of velvety pants was no different lightweight velvet and a great cut yay,1
8492,This romper has a great shape you know that long saggy grandma butt that some rompers give youthis one is not that its cute and adorable and those long stitched pockets are so flattering to us short folk im on a good day g and this fits great i picked up an xs im never an xs and it was very flattering im usually a in pants for reference the vneck and the way the shoulder seams start to angle in at the top make this very flattering it is long enough for me to,1
8493,I actually bought this dress last year and they made another one in a similar dark floral which i also boughtbecause i love this dress so much i wish they would make a different patternid buy a third one the online picture does not do any justice to this dress fits like a dreamsoooo flattering modest but not matronly at all flows beautifully i have received tons of compliments every single time i wear this dress this dress is absolutely lovely please make this in another pattern,1
8494,I love the feel and drape of silk this dress has lovely drape and fantastic color i think if paired with the right sweater and leggings this will work well into the fall and also transition into other seasons if you are savvy the only awkward point about this dress is that you must wear a belt with it if you have an hourglass shape otherwise its a beautiful swing fit,1
8495,These leggings are so comfortable and luxurious when i opened the package i knew i was in trouble they are comfortable and beautiful a perfect piece for any wardrobe,1
8496,This top is easy with nice hem detail,1
8497,Just gorgeous this is one beautiful top the colors are pretty and vibrant i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top dress it up or downthis top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back it looks fantastic with jeans as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it its an all year round top throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go a great top for your wardrobe i would not hesitant to buy it,1
8498,Can dress it up or down and still look good in it i wear leggings under it to keep my legs warm since the material is thin and i live near the ocean this is my new standard summer dress i bought an xxs since i am petite weighing lbs and stand,1
8499,Great fit comfortable and stylish easy to dress up or down excellent item for any wardrobe,1
8500,I was so stoked about this swim suit i bought it for mine and and my husbands anniversary trip it didnt disappoint it was gorgeous amazing quality fabulous on unfortunately in my case though the bottom is incredibly low cut and showed my csection scar so it had to go back,1
8501,Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations i didnt know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm havent worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items im usually an extrasmall but the xxs also fits its a great buy especially since its on sale now,1
8502,This tankblouse is flowy and i love the design it was immediately comfortable and seemed true to size i wore it to a family event with a sweater black leggings and boots im d and usually wear medium in retailer tops and this fit beautifully from the get go just love it,1
8503,This top is an easy classy staple for summer tts and drapes well great shape,1
8504,I have to return this top the armholes are huge the material is on the thin side and not what i expected i cant size down i got an xxs maybe if i had been able to order a petite it would have fit better i ordered the red and i liked the color,0
8505,This is adorable the sweater is lightweight and soft please know that the sweater line falls right at my midriff followed by the fringe so for me its almost cropped the fringe covers my midriff the back is open and so this sweater will not be super warm in the winter but it is stylish and cute i love it its different and unique i purchased xxs in petite fits a little more cropped than the photo shows,1
8506,As the previous reviewer mentioned the pockets ruin this dress pockets usually such a good idea but here theyre misplaced right on the hips and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss,0
8507,I love purchasing these tunicruffle dresses because they can be worn anywherethis dress is definitely a little on the heavy side for winter wearthe color is beautifuli am pounds and always purchase a large for a relaxed fiti plan to wear it out to dinner for my birthday and to a house party on new years day,1
8508,This dress is so different from any you normally see and its gorgeous the blue on bottom is actually a much brighter blue in person than in the pictures on the site the dress pleats along every blue line so when you walk its as if the dress changes colors with every movement its fully lined so nothing shows underneath and its just really beautiful i also like how the back opens but not all the way down so you can wear a strapless bra without the back showing but the sizing was a bi,1
8509,I bought this online so didnt realize that the fabric at the bottom is very very stiff i was expecting something silky or at least on the softer and more moveable side the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt that being the case it kind of juts out in weird places the sweater part is very nice but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o,0
8510,I tried this on in the store and immediately loved it it is diaphanous but that is the intended look the dress is meant to be a cool breezy coverup the design would have been slightly improved with slight tapering at the waist and sleeves but not everyone can carry a fuller dress to begin with anyway i purchased so many things that day that i had to narrow my picks down a bit i left this dress behind but kept thinking about how very pretty it was when retailer offered an addit,1
8511,I love this top i debated between an xs and a s but im usually an xs in deletta so thats what i got it fits perfectly and is beautiful,1
8512,This dress is very pretty i love it people are not kidding about the buttons i was prepared to reinforce them after it arrived unfortunately both buttons at the wrists were missing and they were not in the bag it was on sale so im guessing they were lost before shipping i love the dress enough to keep it it will not be that big of a deal to replace them besides the buttons the dress is a very nice quality it is lined and has a nice weight to it im obsessed with rifle paper co so i,1
8513,This dress is so pretty and i instantly fell in love with it when i tried it on i generally wear size or and opted for the for more room i know some reviewers felt that the dress ran too long at the bottom but for me i was sold on it because this dress is form fitting i like a more conservative look for work wouldnt want formfitting and short dress my favorite kind of dress is formfitting and falls at or below my knees a little,1
8514,This skirt is very short i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle thats quite off because im only feet tall and i wore it pretty low on the hips it also flares out awkwardly below the knee there are vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my year old cut up a skirt plus the fabricwhile thick and beautiful and stretchyhas a,0
8515,This dress is really cute and is a lightweight knit that is great for warmer days the color is a lovely dusty rose that looks just like the picture since it is a knit material and does tend to stretch out i did go down one size so that it would be more form fitting the length on the petite size is perfect for me,1
8516,My favorite pants they do run slightly large so i sized down i have colors and will continue to add more,1
8517,This is a nice year round weight sweater i am thrilled with small details true to retailer pieces,1
8518,These pants are super funky the colors have a s vibe retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website they are playfully chic besides the look they are super comfy and have a nice stretch perfect for my job as an art teacher give them a shot,1
8519,I rarely order pants on lineas the size often varies so much took a chance on these as they were on sale and they are just stinkn adorable i am so glad i did i love them i ordered both colors havent got the neutral pair yet but the green plaid fits me like they were made for me for reference i am about tall my weight is around ish i ordered the regular and they fit perfectly i hope they dont stretch to much when i wear them if so i will update my reviewi just lo,1
8520,Got this shirt in the map design super cute it looks great with jeans or chinos in different colors fun and different shirt fit just as expected,1
8521,I ordered this in the navy and the redblue plaid fit im usually a m after reading reviews i ordered a l and it was the right choice its silky and covers up my postpartum middle nicely i was worried the pleats would accentuate that part of me but it does not at all print love the plaid not sure about the navy with diff color dots that one is probably going back,1
8522,Unusual design and striking color make this the perfect dress this winter season the fit is flattering and the design makes it perfect for work or play,1
8523,I cannot imagine this dress working in any size i am a small thin and average height woman usually a in pants a size c bust and tall this dress was huge i sized down to a i am always a in dresses and this dress was still big i do not know if i could size down to a though as the shoulders seemed to fit right it was ginormous i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be months pregnant it still wouldnt work unless i was months pregnant and carrying tr,0
8524,This dress is comfortable and a great go to dress to wear to work and then after for drinks with friends,1
8525,I love it i can wear out to dinner or just out to lunch withfriends,1
8526,This dress i had to try it on of course i fell in love with it it is so gorgeous in person like a piece of unique artwork youll never find a dress like this,1
8527,I just got this top in the mail and love love love it i thought it was on the pricey side for a shirt but couldnt help but purchase it full price because i love anything pineapple print the metallic print is cute and chic from day to night i also love the open shoulders making this design different and perfect for summer im only sorry that i didnt see this top online until i already returned from my vacation in maui very comfortable and easy worth the price,1
8528,This is a precious its a little thin as i prefer a thicker fabric however wearing a tank top under it works perfectly i have it now in both colors great price on sale,1
8529,Love this shirt and the print i would wear it all the time if socially acceptable ive only worn it once but have already gotten so many compliments there are hints of neon in the coloring that cant really be seen in the pictures i saw it in store and fell in love and then decided to splurge when i saw it online and couldnt think of life without it,1
8530,I bought this on sale in all colors it doesnt look like much in the photos but thats really the point this is a staple basic piece layer on colors and prints like a printed jacket scarf or bag i bought this in wine along with the sweater knit boots and a bag with a print that ties the colors together the shape of this dress is great fitted through the waist and not a lot of extra fabric in the skirt midi is usually a bad length for me but since the skirt isnt overwhelming,1
8531,I noticed this top on one of the sales associates and it looked great shes probably lbs and about tried it on and it looked horrible i even tried sizing down twice im and the ruffles started right under my chest i gave stars bc of the material it is light and summery,0
8532,Great for the beachy business look classy but immensely comfortable i feel like i look sharp without having to sit pokerstraight,1
8533,I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didnt fit its such a cute summer top perfect with cropped jeans im a b and usually a size small but had to size down i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and its super cute because of this though i wouldnt pay full price so im happy it was on sale,1
8534,I love this sweater i checked runs large but its really just a roomy sweater i bought the small which is what i usually buy but it is big enough to wear over long sleeve shirts etc its soft and cozy and i think i wore it days straight when i first got it one of those pieces that you will wear over and over wore it with jeans and a blouse then with palazzos and a tee and then over my workout wear the next day before deciding it was time to give it a rest love this sweater,1
8535,I just received this in my normal petite xs and it fits perfectly its gorgeous in person and i know this will be one of my most worn tops this summer,1
8536,I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite great comfy casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up highly recommend for summer,1
8537,I bought this blouse in black in december of like other reviewers noted it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms it wasnt a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse however i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of and im happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms the blue blouse i just purchased is definitely l,1
8538,This jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly i am lbs and c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but its not at all and fits like a glove i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far easy to throw on when im out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night love,1
8539,Love this dress,1
8540,Great news if you missed out on this tank last year this s the exact style and cut as last seasons buttondown tank released by cs super flattering fit not too poofy it is semiopen in the back and the slit goes as high as the last button super sweet for summer and goes with virtually everything i reeeeally wish they had this one in more colorways its grrrrrfor reference im lbs a in jeans and i tried on an xs last year i purchased an xxs petite and it fits exa,1
8541,I love this dress the pattern is fun the style is relaxed and breezy for springsummer and it is wellmade a steal at the sale price also it has pockets a huge plus for me since it is a loosefitting style i would say it run just a tad big i bought the s petite and i am lbs i couldve gone xs petite but the s fits well and looks great the pattern is stunning a great addition to my summer wardrobe i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant but it hits me right,1
8542,This is a great dress its comfortable easy care and it looks fantastic i love the bright green color its easy to wear alone casually or dressed up with cardigans or jackets for my climate this is a yearround piece i can tone down the color and layer for cool seasons and wear it alone in warm seasons,1
8543,I love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color i purchased size and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size dd with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height so im waiting for the petite to arrive to see if its more flattering i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty so you may want to size down if youre slender or pear shaped,1
8544,I ordered a size in the orange it ran a size smaller than normal size maeve tops the quality of the material was terrible it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath that messes with the look of the lace on the top the color of the orange was gorgeous,0
8545,I had high hopes for this top but it didnt work for me at all it shows your bra straps perfectly plus it was so big and boxy that it made me look about pounds heavier no thanks,0
8546,Probably the most comfortable jeans i have ever owned they are more comfortable even than yoga leggings they look and fit like real jeans while feeling like loungewear i have nothing negative to say about them,1
8547,I tried this skirt on because i liked the green color thinking that the pockets would not be flattering to my size figure i was wrong the pockets are flattering to a round tummy the pocket flap is stitched down on the side and button near the center so they dont stick out a good skirt for fall,1
8548,This dress is amazing the color is a little darker then whats pictured but the dress is great very delicate you have to be careful how you handle it,1
8549,When i saw this tunic dress i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things it is also very comfortable true to size and very good quality material i highly recommend,1
8550,This dress is stunning and very flattering i am a few months postpartum with just a bit of belly flub left and this skims in all the right places without showing that the fabric is gorgeous although it seems like the darker colors can be a little sheer i got the holly absolutely love this would consider picking up another color i do find it runs a little small compared to other dolan pieces including those in this fabric i have a tunic and another dress in a small i got a medium here,1
8551,I bought this online to wear in my engagement photos and its absolutely perfect i typically wear a size l or xl and could have easily worn the l in this top runs a tad big keep in mind it is on the shorter side i will be purchasing a white tank to wear underneath it,1
8552,This top fits tts the sweater part is cream eyelet material is white love it,1
8553,Just not as long as in the picture it hit me at my hips not good,0
8554,This is way cuter in person than on model it is a super soft and fluffy sweater the colors are so pretty and feminine i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice its perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect,1
8555,I was very impressed with the fit of this sweater dress i am a p and the length and general fit of this is perfect the fabric is so soft love it,1
8556,I bought this well made cute top today and love it it can be day time casual or dressy for dinner you will want to probably wear a cami underneath since its see through its perfect for summer im a d pounds and usually wear a medium but the small fit perfectly with room to spare cuter in person,1
8557,This top is so soft i want to wear it every day the orange is beautiful in person great fall color perfect amount of swing,1
8558,I was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store it has my favorite colors in it blue and orange as one reviewer said the print is eyecatching the feel of the material is soft i am tall so it fits on me like a dress although if you are a taller person the slits on the side may be higher on the frame this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now,1
8559,I normally avoid white tops because they usually dont have that popbut when i saw the s styling on it i just had to try it i came in to buy another top from their catalog but it was such a wow i walked out with it instead,1
8560,I love this jumpsuit ive worn it twice and received many compliments both times absolutely gorgeous i couldnt be happier c,1
8561,This dress is comfortable hugs and skims at all the right places and sports a perfect length for a shortie like me wish the other patterns werent sold out,1
8562,Loving this top the material is lovely and high quality plus the design is very flattering on body perfect for cooler evenings out did i mention super flattering,1
8563,Im not sure why this dress has such bad online reviews because i absolutely love it it fit tts for me but i have a large bust so will run big if you are smaller on top i dont like paying full price usually but the quality and beauty of this dress justified it if you are into prints and colors you will definitely be able to pull it off,1
8564,Tried it on at the local store today it is very pretty i believe i runs large i am usually a small but they only had an xs and it fit perfectly it is made of thick linen and has a lining,1
8565,Beautiful fallwinter piece so soft and comfy was unsure about it when i saw it online but once i saw it in store and got to try it on and feel it i could not put it down i felt you could definitely size down,1
8566,This cardigan is utterly gorgeous way prettier on than i feared my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms and so i finally looked closely at the tag the tag says the back section which looks exactly like the weave on the arms has a measly wool snuck into the fabric content why retailer why wool i am so sensitive to it my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in itnow i have a problem,1
8567,This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life sizing was mostly true to size for me slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips im and and ordered a size i usually size up to a with retailer pencil skirts a probably would have fit as well especially in the waist but didnt want it too big in the hips length was perfect to my knees,1
8568,Great length very comfortable very pretty perfect dressy winter skirt,1
8569,This was sold out in an xs when i first saw the email i ended up seeing in my local retailer store and tried on my usual xs i am with a longer torso and about pounds my chest size is c and the xs was just too tight it buttoned up beautifully and the length was as it is on the model even though i am much shorter however when i tried to move my arms the jacket constricted all movement this is a huge disappointment and i imagine going to be an issue for many girls who order online,1
8570,These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering i bought them in coral and wore with a black peasant top sandals and a long necklace they do stretch out a lot though so i would recommend sizing down i bought mine to look like they fit on the model and after a few hours they were hanging off of me so buy them a little bit tighter than you like the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist,1
8571,This is the jacket ive been looking for i love the collarlapels they can lay flat or be worn up a bit the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy i got the black but its really more of a charcoal black vs jet black the colordye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast when zipped its form fitting but not tight tts im lbs,1
8572,The skirt is a little longer than i expected it hits me at my calf i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so im going to wear it as it the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely very feminine nice skirt for a picnic,1
8573,The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legsvery comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there,1
8574,The pictures dont do this justice its so beautiful on drapes incredibly the cream color is a warm creamy bright off white looks really nice incredibly comfortable i could see this being an excellent item to wear on planes super cozy and chic a must have,1
8575,I was skeptical about buying a romper i was also unsure what size would fit me im and lbs to my delight the romper fit perfectly its a gorgeous and flattering fit i love the design and fabric its stunning,1
8576,Im seriously in awe of this fun dress the beading fuzzy flowers and embroidery on the peachy dress make me very happy its nice to wear by itself with a simple necklace but i love it more with my cropped jacketsmy dark denim for a casual air or the tailored tuxedo black for date night like others have said this dress has many layers and is surprisingly heavy definitely not for hot humid weather or id melt and cry thank you so much to the reviewer who advised sizing up for the ar,1
8577,I wore this for a few hours and while it i got compliments i ended up needing to return it after the seams opened up over the shoulder blades the fabric is so fine that during the normal goingsabout of my day it gave way and no i didnt buy too small and the fabric didnt pull while i was driving or reaching for anything,0
8578,This is a great basic t that works with shorts pants or a skirt,1
8579,I was hesitant about this one since ive tried cloth stone shirts instore and found them to be tight in the shoulders and arms i have athletic shoulders and arms so i didnt have high hopes for this one i tried it on instore and its surprisingly true to size i always wear m in tops and this fits perfectly it is long but i like that theres enough length that i can tuck it in for reference im lbs a cup across the shoulders,1
8580,I havent gotten a dress from retailer in a long time that i like as i do this one this is the old retailerquality extras and unique design fits like it was made for metts i am lbs and the is perfection no enlarged arm holes or funky fitit has lining as well as a tutu slip underneath so you can create your own fullness in the skirt it is very fitted at the bust and waist and will hide numerous flaws at the hips this dress is spectacular so dont waitpress the button,1
8581,After reading many of the reviews stating the dress can have the potato sack look i certainly had concerns particularly since i am petite hourglass athletic and approaching i decided t give the blue shade a try the lighter shade is beautiful but was afraid it would wash me out with my darker hair and olivetoned skin let me start by saying the blue is so beautiful and rich looking the velvet has such dimension and is no ordinary velvet material it is also lined when i first tried i,1
8582,I like this top a lot its cuter in person than it looks on the model its a little heathered it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model and im pretty small on topoverall nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site,1
8583,These were fabulous and a great color in person true to a normal ag fit i am and the regular size was too long so i am exchanging them for the petite version in the same size really hoping they fit the same as the regular version,1
8584,The color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it but it was awful i am and the length was fine the problem is the lack of shape which made me look lbs heavier than i am it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like,0
8585,As beautiful as in the picture couldnt go wrong with it excellent quality and gorgeous color,1
8586,I saw this in the store and grabbed it to try on due to the material and the back i was surprised how nice it felt on and how the back looked i had a blue bra on and it really could not be seen which was a worry i loved how the back lay and that it was shorter in the front even for the sale price it was expensive but i went home with it it will go great with long skirts jeans and any color pants i was very happy to walk out of the store with it i am and about i have a slende,1
8587,The print and fit of this dress is perfect its very flattering and slimming,1
8588,This is my new favorite dress,1
8589,This dress overwhelmed me im feet tall and the print and material just took over,0
8590,Just got these mara hoffman classic bikini bottoms in flight azure printtoday and love them high quality fully lined and reversible the pattern placement is perfectly symmetrical and the colors are just like the online photosi think the size chart on the mara hoffman site is correct for where the bottoms sit on my body above the widest part i have a ashape with smaller waist and hips full behind and thighs currently ish at the widest which is at my thighs in these t,1
8591,This blouse is so pretty i love the long tie the pattern is very unique it is a thin light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket,1
8592,I dont know what took me so long to pull the trigger on this itemprobably because it wasnt in my store for very long so i didnt try it on in person i decided to order this based upon the reviews and i was immediately obsessed this cardigan is magical i first wore it to work with black trousers and a plain crewneck tshirt underneath with a bib necklace and everybody in my office thought i was wearing the cutest blazer i had all the ladies come feel it to prove it in fact feels like a,1
8593,I bought two one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry it shrunk up in the length and in the width and now it doesnt fit at all also after one wear the buttons are coming off before i even put it in the wash and its covered in loose threads the quality is just not there im going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on,0
8594,Casual comfort with style fabric is a dream to wear and it flows nicely not exactly formfitting but still flattering im and wore the medium,1
8595,I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear however after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing so i tried it on what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person and very soft and warm its a perfect winter sweater to start the new year i am lbs and the medium fit perfectly though its a little shorter on me than shown in the photos,1
8596,Nonstop compliments i wear this with dresses at the office and denim on the weekends super versatile this is one of those pieces that you keep forever,1
8597,Being ft longmaxi dresses are usually not what i buy but i tried this dress on and it was the perfect length for me i wear size or and i tried on both sizes in store the i tried on had a shorter length for some reason than the maybe it was a petite and was mislabeled i ended up getting the and i love the dress,1
8598,These pants are adorable i am a petite lady with a small waist and have a hard time finding pants that fit and look good but these do they are both cute and elegant and they have pockets i have had many compliments the one drawback is they need dry cleaning,1
8599,I love this sweater i am and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length the overall fit was the same i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here more a grey and purplish colour beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment this sweater is nice for all ages it is soft comfortable and versatile it might just be my go to fall sweater,1
8600,Absolutely lovely dress in a gorgeous color drapes well the perfect blend of pretty and sexy so much more beautiful in person,1
8601,I purchased this in the ivory color and love it very comfortable and agree with reviewer who said it looks good with button or buttoned up my one complaint is that i found it to be such an open weave that i feel it necessary to wear a cami underneath which is not the end of the world the other issue i have the back is definitely longer than the front as pictured im not sure why retailer feels compelled to have almost every top they sell have this styling i dont think its necessary an,1
8602,Fits well true to size very stylish and comfortable im going to have to buy these in more colors,1
8603,Ive been stalking this beauty since it came out and when i saw it went on sale with an extra percent off code i knew i had to purchase well worth the price i paid a bit steep at full price i went with a size medium i usually take a small in retailer tops and these days im around a c im also tall with long arms the design is very forgiving with the cropped sleeve and nonclosing front so you have some wiggle room it fits me like it was custom made the material is a lightwei,1
8604,You cant go wrong with this one its is super flattering the size medium fit perfectly for reference i have a in chest ff and in the medium i was not over exposed and it can be worn with a racing back bra with it not showing i wish it came i more colors please retailermake this one in more colors,1
8605,Good job retailer for getting the color representation spot on the blue is so vibrant and the cashmere knit is so soft and comfortable the dress is oversized but a little too much so i recommend sizing down to get that ideal slouchy drape otherwise you may overwhelm your frame with too much fabric,1
8606,This shirt was great for one wear after just one wash followed instructions to dry clean it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet terrible waste of money on a pricey top,0
8607,I think when this is new it runs big and then shrinks to the right size thats what it did for me anyway it did shrink after one wash but not significantly i bought it in m and feel it stayed within that range super cute with shorts airy light love the white ordering another color,1
8608,I bought two pair in one weekcrazy right i am and lbs i bought the pink color soft faded pink which drew me to them right awaykinda soft and romantic pink then two days later went back one hour drive and bought the silver which is really a worn in green color i feel these are true to size i wouldnt size down because these aret super stretchyfeels like it also wont bag out during the day i really love these cordsand the rolled up cuff is adorable,1
8609,I havent worn a pair of levis in ages and had forgotten how great they are i have recently lost weight and i have to say they are very flattering i wasnt sure at first how i would ilike the frayed hems but they are growing on me,1
8610,I bought this dress as a surprise for my daughter she was very happy with it,1
8611,Like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer the lining however is not silk its rayon and sat weird on me it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless i do have a large bust i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will im keeping the dress the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture,1
8612,I saw this online and went to the store yesterday to find it i tried on a m which is my normal size and a s which if clothes are baggy ill buy for a more fitted look the s was too small in the shoulders and my arm movement was restricted so i bought the m this is definitely true to size it has a blousy waist to it so no amount of downsizing will make this a fitted jacket notice the model is pushing the jacket down with her hands in the pockets to make it look like it has a more defi,1
8613,I love wearing this dress and have had many compliments its a great color and a fabulous fit,1
8614,I purchased this top in the white and love the contrast between the stripes and floral pattern around the neckline it fit perfectly however im concerned that it might shrink because then it would be too short i am tall lbs and small busted it draped really nicely small would give me a little more length but may be too loose,1
8615,I think this shirt would be really cute on the right body type just not mine im and a ddd a couple weeks post partum thought this could be a good shirt while im nursing bc its flowy but stylish unfortunately it did nothing for me when i put it on the cut drew all attention to my big chestnot in a good wayand distracted from my smaller lower half made me look much bigger and heavier than i actually am probably good for small chested girls very tall girls or curvy on the,0
8616,Runs big and looked unflattering i am petite might work on someone taller,0
8617,I probably should have gone with petite this dress was just awful on the waist was nowhere near where it was supposed to be it hits me about thigh level its very unforgiving clingy and shows every bump i found the material tolerable but if worn for long periods of time i have a suspicion that it would begin to irritate my skin and be scratchy its going back,0
8618,I love this sweater i bought it in navy at this sale price and now plan on ordering it in the cream color it runs a tad large and it might even stretch just a teensy bit but not a lot however i adore sweaters to be a little too big so this is perfect for me whenever i wear this sweater i get huge compliments to the end that the friends wants to go online and order it for herself tkhe only problem with the sweater is that i love it so much i want to wear it every single day which is why,1
8619,I really liked this dress i agree with the others that say the side seam comes up pretty high i think id wear as a tunic or open like the model i cant justify full price though tts my normal med fit,1
8620,I love this slip i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without i am c and the xs fits perfectly also i think it looks better in person,1
8621,I adore this sweater so happy that i was able to get one get random compliments from strangers all the time,1
8622,I havent worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it hoping that itll fit me i love the swing skirt and the halter this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood there is a side zipper i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model it is unlined but with the color of the dress i dont mind it,1
8623,I love these pants so much i have them in two colors they are super comfy light and actually really chic perfect cool girl pants i have got so many compliments my young students love my ninja pants i got them on sale great great buy i highly recommend them,1
8624,This jacket is sweet and swingy and showing an early sixties vibe that i adore a bit cropped and wide so definitely size down so your proportions dont look off i took my medium and it was way too wide and unflattering so i switched to a sp looks and feels great with layers,1
8625,Love this so much its beautiful and i get tons of compliments its a touch short as a dress but looks amazing with leggings,1
8626,These pants are a great addition to my work wardrobe i needed to size up more so for my legs vs my waist but nothing a little tailoring wont fix,1
8627,I bought this dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner its beautiful the material is thicker than i imagined not a bad thing at all i ironed it with lots of steam and it came out great the tie in back is nice because it can be cinched tight or worn more loosely,1
8628,I bought this dress in the red option was a little concerned when i read other reviews that said it looked like a maternity dress but it didnt look like that on me at all it falls nicely and fits me well i am ft lbs in size xs love the details at the neckline and hem will be looking out for other dresses by maeve,1
8629,This is such a cute sweater i wouldnt really call it a poncho since it has standard sweater sleeves it has a wide circle hem which is very flattering i would have loved this even more if it were available in other colors besides white red black or navy would have been perfect,1
8630,These are such a great fall staple the silver color is the perfect greyolive and the texture is perfect doesnt feel like there is extra material like most cords and they hold their shape throughout the day the fit is just perfect i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly,1
8631,Love love love this dress the fabric is high quality the colors are rich and vibrant the fit is very flattering with the open neckline and fitted waist versatile piece that can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or dressed down with tights and boots my usual size fits perfectly,1
8632,I really liked the look of the orange so ordered an xs i prefer a s petite but it is sold out the xs arrives and while i still like the color the fit is really weird the cowl is very high up but the sleeves are still long it looks nothing like the photo i cannot see how the cowl sits on the models collar bone despite eliding the color the design is off so have to return,0
8633,Modern unique versatile love it paired with the essential culottes usually size small but got the xs otherwise the armholes dipped down too low as did the back hem of the sweater,1
8634,I think ive made a hobby out of trying on jumpsuits rompers this season i now own three including this one in my usual size small d i passed right by this online but it drew my attention in the store i didnt realize it was chocolate brown and ivory im a sucker for brown i tried it on on a whim and it looked great i am tallalmost and it looked great i will say it shows off my bottom for better or worse more than other jumpsuits it doesnt give me a wedgie but a,1
8635,This shirt fits very closely to the body it has a very strange fit in the shoulder though the arms themselves are really long far past my hands yet its very tight in the shoulder and under arm area for reference i am pounds and ordered a small which is what i usually need,0
8636,Comfortable and true to size it fits more fitted on the top and very swingyflowy on the bottom i got a petite and the length was perfect if you like to wear very high heels you may want to go with a regular as its a tad short,1
8637,Was looking for something lighter as we go into warmer temperatures and this one is greatz looks just like pictured and ha a flattering fit,1
8638,I agree with the other viewers that this cardigan is significantly better looking in person i am lbs and bought the medium it is more fitted than how it is on the model it keeps its shape after multiple wears and is very comfortable im glad i have it,1
8639,I know this is labeled under activewear but the fabric is a dream its incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too i generally am a l or xl and the large fit well its alined and has a bit of stretch to it its so comfortable highly recommend,1
8640,I love this great coverage goes with everything flattering pockets soft and soothing taupey gray palette a retailer does it again,1
8641,Cute dress can be worn with boots flats or heels i am lbs b chest and i got this dress in size petite small i am pear shape with a bigger bottom and love how dress enhances my shape my style is more classic but i really like this dress,1
8642,Very slimming lovely dressa nice addition to your fall winter wardrobethe embroidery is lovely fabric soft and comfortable sized perfectly so happy with this beautiful black dress,1
8643,These are light and airy and pretty they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam a little above the knee while i was lying in my bedthey also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly seethrough as it is so thin therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants great i would not leave the house in them or turn over in bed in themwhen i sit the slits fall down around my thighs my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way,0
8644,The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely seethrough i mean seriously seriously seethrough,0
8645,So different than anything in my closet its wide with a beautiful drape fabric is soft but substantial it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size so cute on,1
8646,I love these pants they are really comfortable without sacrificing style perfect for the office or just running around im ft inches and lbs i bought the medium which fits perfectly,1
8647,This is one of my favorite tops ive ordered flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck i get compliments every time i wear it,1
8648,I bought the design which has now sold out of the sailboats and waves along the top the tshirt is super soft and thin but its not sheer or seethrough very light and cool for hot humid summer days has some nice stretch as well a really gentle cotton knitthis top does run large maybe thats so it will be cool and not stick to you thus i didnt size down because i dont like clothes too formfitting on super hot days,1
8649,I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue both are lovely i would say that the size runs a bit large i bought size and the bodice hangs away from my back arms fit well though loose fit hangs well the lace is nice and stiff the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained i dont think that will be how it reads though but fair warning,1
8650,The details on this blouse lace inset in front and sheer back look just as great in person as they do in the photos the fabric is wonderful too the knit has enough heft that it doesnt show every body imperfection or detail in your bra it held up well through its first wash and ironing as well as others have noted the style is versatile easy to wear with a cardigan or blazer at work or to pair with skinny jeans or shorts on the weekend i was also positively impressed by the color sin,1
8651,This sweater is perfect with leggings crop pants jeans and wide leg pants a line sleeves does not cling to waist area very flattering so soft comfortable and thick cotton knit no cami required length is bum covering,1
8652,This is a lovely and unique blouse it can be worn with jeans shorts or a skirt such a beautiful addition to anyones wardrobe,1
8653,I bought this during a off sale which made it even more worth the price i would have purchased and kept it regardless but just got luckylooking at the pictures online i thought the coat was going to be red however when it showed up it is more purple i still like the color and did end up keeping the coati do think the buttons are sewn on well but i was surprised it did not come with additional buttons in case one gets lost these are very unique buttons so i cant imagine it woul,1
8654,This is the perfect casual top to wear alone or layered with a cardigan love it,1
8655,I am a big fan of ag im sure i have pairs i will say that i have rejected some of their offerings in the past because the fabric has been weird denim that is so stretchy it doesnt look like real denim fabric is so thin it shows every lump or bump etc so im always cautious especially with their stretch twill that aside these particular jeans in this gray color are awesome ag nailed it great color supportive slimming fabric great length and rise a job well done ag howe,1
8656,I love this dress id get it in both colors if i could the cut and fit is beautiful id suggest sizing down if you feel like its too boxy or lacks shape the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl thing to look for in a dress and its just overall a classic pretty dress my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and im afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isnt incredibly delicate like,1
8657,This is a great fun dress its very unique and well built my only complaint is that the colors are not the same in the photo the real colors are black on top and a bright red with shiny torquoise thread running through it its still gorgeous,1
8658,This dress is amazing it is comfortable with great fabric and very high quality if you have a lot of curves it may not be the best dress as it has no give and flows straight down from the shoulder,1
8659,It was lighter weight than i expected but thats perfect for me considering florida winters are mild its more like a wool sweater than coat the design is gorgeous however ran bigger than anticipated im hoping an exchange to the xs will work otherwise im not sure i can get the fit i expect from this sweater coat the buttons are plastic and would have made a much bigger impact if they were wooden but theyre still nice overall i love it and am hoping for the right fit so i can flaunt thi,1
8660,I ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly i love the longer length so that it can be worn with leggings the detail is so pretty especially the colorful side panels,1
8661,This dress is really beautiful the material is soft and sways but it is sweaterlike not flimsy it does seem to run maybe a little large throughout but i liked that look not formfitting has more of a drape,1
8662,Well fitting bra comfortable not itchy lace doesnt show through tops,1
8663,I saw this dress and had to have it it is very cute and comfortable i have fuller hips so im not sure about the stripe across the widest section of my body the arm holes are a little gaping as well as other reviewers have mentioned i bought the medium which fits well everywhere but the arm holes i think the small would fit me everywhere but the hips so im on the fence of whether to keep it i do like the dress and it is of good quality it just may not be the right fit for me im a,1
8664,I am so in love with this dress i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed i am about lbs d and the fit perfectly i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it,1
8665,This is different from any bra ive had before in a good way the lace over the front is really beautiful and no annoying straps means its comfortable fit and support are both great i didnt notice that it was silk when i ordered so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant i wasnt expecting an underwire either based on the sml sizing but it has one,1
8666,I knew i had a winner when my husband said cute top the first time i put this on the style quality and sizing are all excellent i love the lace detailing in addition to the open shoulder style i am always looking for long sleeve tops that go great with jeans and are right on trend this a great addition to my all wardrobe,1
8667,Comfortable thick material think structured sweatshirt material easy to throw on and look as if effort was made when it wasnt sizing im between a large and xl usually large was perfect im tall and curvy g curvy and this cardigan belted jacketis very flattering,1
8668,This was all wrong on me the puffy sleeves made me look a foot wider im thinking this will look good on tall slim ladies it is extremely comfortable and the material is very pretty though tts,1
8669,This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy but to the contrary the skirt is flattering and slimming at the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee lbs waist hips size regular is a perfect fit,1
8670,I fell in love with the dress when i saw it but i was worried about a few things before ordering it one comment mentioned that the slip underneath was tight in the hips yet as a size in pants the slip was still fine the other concern was the length i was worried that the dress would be very short compared to my height however it was a good length in the front and the back was came down longer than the front which helped the overall length overall i ordered a size and it fit well in,1
8671,Love this sweater fits perfect flattering and soft i got it in both colors it is a true staple,1
8672,These jeans were not for me they are very straighthence the name parallel im have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and didnt flatter my shape at allhowever very nice jean once again from pilcro,1
8673,Like many of the other reviewers i thought this ran a little big i am a lb pear and xs was perfect i also ordered the small to be sure it is not quite as close to the body as the picture the color is gorgeous and saturated it hits me mid thigh in a good way the fabric is crepe on the outside and silky on the inside and it has a beautiful high quality drapeyness it is unlined but not see through it arrived wrinkled and sad but a warm dry iron really brought out how gorgeous,1
8674,The material on this dress is so soft and wonderfully drapey super flattering defines waist enough to not add bulk but also hide a tummy the purple color is lovely perfect for fall for reference im dd lbs with hourglass figure,1
8675,I really loved this top the minute i put it on read the other reviews but it really worked for me i am dd athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe plan to wear with light denim dark denim and black cropped denim bottoms even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt the weight is really nice and it washed nicely i washed on delicate and laid flat to dry a little pressing and good as new it has a nice boze,1
8676,As others have mentioned theyre quite long im and need to wear heels to make sure these dont drag theyre much tighter in the butt and thighs than my other pilco pants i love the button detail at the ankles,1
8677,I ordered the cream colored duster after purchasing the grey one in store i loved the grey one so much i had to get the other color i love the length of the item i am and dont feel like it is too short for me to get the look it is light weight so i did not get too warm in it and will be able to wear it much of the year i did wear it open as i feel that it runs a tad tight on the arms and torso when buttoned however i prefer the look of it worn open so that was not a problem for me,1
8678,Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well,1
8679,I loved the criss cross part of this tank however it looked so frumpy on the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on i returned it the material felt nice too,0
8680,What a great light dress for spring and summer evenings i love the length and the laid back style this dress is true to size,1
8681,This top is great to wear under a blazer when cool or alone on a warm day i rated it as runs small only because if you are a little busty as i am it is a little snug across the chest otherwise fits great,1
8682,I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home for me it was true to size and the star print was perfect flowy but not in maternity way at all im gonna have to go back for this one,1
8683,I love this dress i live in maxi dresses versus shorts in the summer and this is the perfect cut weight and quality i did have to order it in petite or else i was stepping on the bottom unless really high heels i am so i would say that it runs long offer this cut in more colors,1
8684,I ordered this dress in a size for reference i am lbs i love it the fit is perfect unlike other reviews i was aware the hem was unfinished and i like the look the top part does not seem to short the style to me is kinda retro i wore the dress with flipflops and a large chunky necklace i received lots of compliments it is my favorite dress right now,1
8685,This shirt is gorgeous i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle its an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion,1
8686,This blouse is stunning on the website however it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo i was very disappointed and will be returning,0
8687,Adorable with black pants or jeans covers the part of your arm you might want covered,1
8688,I was so excited about this top as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way unfortunately this top feels like an old grandmas polyester suit the sides are much shorter than the front back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way due to the layered fabric sadly going back,0
8689,Although i wish this was not so dark blue for summer it is the most fabulous cut super sexy with the tie neckline and love the side pockets and did i mention the fabric is ridiculously soft i just wish it was more of a blue denim blue but nonetheless i could not walk away from the store without this i am lbs and medium fit me perfect for length in the leg,1
8690,Love this tank so easy to throw on quickly and still look out together,1
8691,I am always on the hunt for a cute white tshirt but this one was a miss it is too boxy short and the material is very thin for the price i gave it two stars because it has nice colors for springsummer for reference i am and lbs and i ordered a small bought it online so i ended up returning it to the store,0
8692,I picked these off of the rack at retailer mainly because i loved the navy black and brown combo of the squares i tried on the medium because they looked on the small side even though i usually wear a size or small in pants good thing too these fit really wellso they do run small albeit a bit long in the regular medium on my frame i could have used a petite for length if they had been there but they didnt thats ok i dont mind rolling them up it makes a statement i like ye,1
8693,I went into retailer looking for a specific dress and had to try this on when i saw how lovely it looked displayed at the store it is a beautiful dress not see through at all substantial weight not to heavy and so very beautiful i stayed tts on it i would have purchased it but was buying other dresses i may go back as it will be perfect for the hot summer days,1
8694,This coat wont take me through a cold boston winter but i will be willing to sacrifice a little warmth in order to take this beauty out for a night on the town its chic slim elongating and bold it looks fantastic paired with some bold tall boots and solid colors underneath as for sizing i tend to disagree with most runs small reviews but this baby runs small especially if you really do live in a cold climate and intend to wear something substantial underneath my bust measurement is,1
8695,When i tried on this bathing suit i decided to not try on any others it was just right i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no funas i can never find a suitable bathing suit this suit looks niceflattering and i can also move around in it and it stays in place i purchased it in the navy and im going to order it in another pattern as well it looks modern and classic its a chic style im a size in dresses and i purchased a size in this bathing suit,1
8696,I am not a model shape but this dress looked so light and beautiful i had to try it it wasnt available in my local store so i risked it and ordered online im and about lbs the medium fits perfectly i will say that the skirt fabric comes much more sharply pleated than it looks in the photos maybe this hangs outmellows over time the lining to the knee is going to be great for warm summer days can wear to work with a shrug and some flats or to a summer wedding the pattern is bea,1
8697,I just discovered this dress a few days ago and its simply dreamy id been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest the lace cutouts are gorgeous,1
8698,I purchased this in the green nice print not overwhelming slips on hides a bra and was simply comfortable to wear can easily be dressed up or down but i was looking for a dress that i could slip on at the last minute to go out to dinner with friends i took it on a trip to florida and it did not wrinkle in my suitcase what more can you ask for,1
8699,I hope you can get this topthis is a great classicthat will be in my closet for a long time,1
8700,I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them they were obviously too small for whoever did that these never should have been resent to another customer they are obviously very misshapen they are going back on a bet,0
8701,I disagree with the fit description from the other reviews i find the shirt to be super flattering and comfy yes it it short in comparison to many styles these days but it hits right at the waistline without being too short super vibrant colors,1
8702,When i unwrapped this a chemical stink hit me that amost knocked me over it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out i do not recommend this fo,0
8703,Love this top the crossover design is so cute i ordered by normal xs lbs and was worried it wouldnt fit right in the chest d but it does and even though its cut on the lower side its made so there is no gap in the shirt when you bend over has a little elastic in there to keep everything together perfect length and nice thicker material got the navy and red stripe and with white jeans is so cute,1
8704,Perfect for work or going out i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate it did not feel scratchy to me maybe because i layered it great buy especially with the discounts feel like i lucked out,1
8705,I just got this sweater and it really is a great fall weight i disagree with other reviewers that it is oversized and that the sleeves are long i found the sleeves to be just right and it to fit normally i almost wish i got a medium just so it would be a little baggier and the sleeves would be a little longer i got the green and am really happy with the color,1
8706,I just bought this top in size medium and i love it super comfortable and flowy if you want to dry it in the machine just put cold air and it wont shrink dont use hot air,1
8707,I really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just isnt for me the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable the fit is not quite right on me the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not it was not very comfortable for me either so this was clearly not a win for me,0
8708,These are a different take on the white jean thick enough that you dont see undies cool lace detail on the ankles i have very long legs so they hit me a little higher than described i did undo the laces a bit to give them a little kick at the bottom i love the fit of the plico jean i own a few pairs and they sit just high enough on my waist so when you bend over your bottom doesnt peek out i usually wear a and they arent too tight and have a bit of stretch but dont loose their s,1
8709,White and silver threads made fabric look grey almost dirty fit was nice and price is great villa to pool to restaurant would be great colored fabric would be better,0
8710,This is a sweet lightweight top that i will wear again and again nice touches in the front and back little keyhole opening with two buttons at the neck in back,1
8711,Wonderful shirt soft and flattering usually wear a medium but got the large to layer over tanks and leggings could have easily worn a medium but large is not frumpy at all,1
8712,I tried this shirt in a small my usual retailer size and it was very unflattering the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made however this shirt is so unstructured and oversized i might as well worn a brown paper bag,0
8713,This one didnt work for me ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein riverdeck was cute and flattering cut this one was boxy on me and didnt work a bit too wide so sending back,0
8714,These tshirts by pure good are buttery soft and so flattering they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee i have from last year machine washed many many times on delicate cycle and they still look almost new i was hoping to pick up a couple more but theyre gone please retailer bring these tees back i would kill for that beautiful dark blue,1
8715,I love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it wasnt so flattering on such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee,0
8716,I love the ease of this dress the style can be dressed up or down the straps are inset a little which doesnt work for every body type the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet the length is just right not too long like some other maxi dresses the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra i am normally a or in dresses the waistband hits,1
8717,I look like i put a baggy bag over my head also the material really seemed like fake velvet to me,0
8718,High quality soft thick fabric that drapes well keeps you warm and figure flattering im and the length is perfect the color is a great neutral that goes well with everything love the design detail throughout this cardigan does not have a button or tie closure so if you are between sizes go with the smaller size for a tailored fit,1
8719,Very well made and comfortable with nice finishing touches and fabric looking forward to wearing it many different ways either with jeans pants or long dresses im and petite sizes were out of stock so i chose small regular which looks great not too long so i wont have to shorten,1
8720,Love this top for casual days fits perfectly fabric feels quality and color is bright but not too bright good length just touches top of my thighs,1
8721,Love the pattern play on this skirt i had to size up to a i usually take a or in skirts as it was too snug in the hipswaist going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee im thought it looked cute with the cloth stone chambray tank,1
8722,At and pounds with a short waist its hard to find attractive jeans hit the jackpot with these theyre comfortable very slimming with a perfect rise and length i ordered size so i did go up a size love the button closure instead of a zipper these are much better than my citizen boyfriends that cost twice as much try these you wont be disappointed,1
8723,I never write reviews and i do a ton of online shopping but i had to write how amazing this dress is so happy with this purchase totally worth every penny it fits like a dream the rouching on the side is so pretty and i love the full coverage at the top such he pretty colors too perfect dress,1
8724,I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever but this dress is awful i ordered the black and white the fabric is very poor quality the colors are washed out i almost didnt try it on but i did and found that for me the fit was terrible though some of the reviewer pictures are cute,0
8725,I tried on the grey motif yesterday and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved and the only thing i bought im dd lbs and the xs was a perfect fit for me i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms so i generally wear a small but i tried on the small and the arms were a bit baggy i plan on wearing tanks underneath so the xs was the right call if you want to wear something thicker long sleeved underneath go with your usual size,1
8726,I purchased this for a recent trip with my friends and thought it was worth the price the swimsuit is comfortable yet flattering and all the patterns are really unique i received a lot of compliments about the swimsuit the one downside was that the fabric hook for one of the straps broke so i had to sew it back on other than that this was a great purchase i recommend this to anyone who wants a very whimsical but comfy swimsuit,1
8727,I just bought these shorts in the gold color the fit is just right and the material quality matches up to the price you pay totally worth every penny,1
8728,Perfect summer dress this is a must buy it can be dressed up or down,1
8729,The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre i cant believe no one else has commented on them yet i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses i tend to be a small size in retailer the armholes are so long that the dress doesnt lay right on top i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me we looked at all the others and they were the same going up a size made it way worse this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul,0
8730,I love this jacket it is stylish yet has the softness of you favorite lounge wear the faux fur gives it a touch of holiday fun and the fitted cut flatters your shape,1
8731,This dress is more beautiful in personthis dress fits well on top for my broad shoulders chestcand through my straight hips note the side bottom panels are very stretchy i will have it tailored slimmer so if you are bottom curvy this dress is awesome,1
8732,Very flattering suit runs large i stumbled into this in my local store must have been a return i tried it on even though it was a size small not my usual medium fit like a glove covered my c chest i have tried many suits and this is best on my curvy shape flattering to tummy i am lb not very toned at years of age this suit is amazing highly recommend,1
8733,I bought the white and olive today i usually get a size s but opted for the xs for this shirt i am longer torsoed than perhaps average so it came to just below midbutt which i like my shoulders are on the broader side and a bit muscular but even still the xs was perfect and cute rather than just comfy def an undershirt is needed for these but i run cold so i nearly always have an undershirt the fabric is just nice enough that i could wear the shirt with a fun nice skirt with a high,1
8734,Im in love with this skirt i already have so many outfits planned out i do feel it runs slight large maybe half a size im lbs and usually wear a i ordered a small and its fairly loose but i like that personally if you want a tighter pencil look then size down,1
8735,This top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color i wasnt too sure id like the cut on the bottom but the neckline was so lovely i thought id try it out i went with a small which is my usual if not extra small and loved it as soon as i put it on the shape is very flattering even with my post baby figure i definitely think that its better in person than in the photos online and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater thats both classic and mode,1
8736,This says online only hwoever the balc one was in my store and some other colros too anyway i actually liked this top it is more flattering than the model shows i think i could wear this with pants or legginss in botos on me the regualr size is almost a dress should i be younger but i do like that i did debate ordering petite and decided not to it is thin enough to not be too hot indoors and sublte stripes on the black versionnoyte previous reviewer mentioend something about,1
8737,I purchased the violet chinos in my local store the color to me is more plum than violet but a nice shade still the fit was perfect and they are oh so comfortable i bought size weight fluxes i can see having several pairs of these in other colors because of the comfort level and they work for fall spring and summer in the warmer states even winter the fabric has a soft feel to it,1
8738,I ordered this on a whim not sure what to expect im petite and ordered a small petite i usually wear xss in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs it fits beautifully and is very cozy too the collar is gorgeous and very soft i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe,1
8739,I ordered these in a xxs a little nervous about them being too small and i was very pleased with the fit for reference im lbs these are great for all seasons the lining is warm yet adds a pop of color when cuffed the crowns on the birds are pretty nifty,1
8740,The structure makes this fit perfectly the details are also lovely and it is soft and wellmade it is a little sheer but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath if you are between sizes i would probably size up,1
8741,This cute dress has a built in slip so no need for a slip i think it has a flattering fit and the colors are prettyi feel like i could wear this dress to a shower out to dinner or just for a fun look to shop on a nice day,1
8742,I tried this on today and loved it it is so well made and stays down off the shoulders without any struggle it is lined in the front and the back is billowy and gorgeous a timeless and well made piece,1
8743,This top looks even better in person the fit is very flattering and the fabric is comfortable i highly recommend it,1
8744,This dress is soft and comfortable its perfect for summer i ordered my usual size petite and it fits perfectly,1
8745,I got this dress in the gray size small and it fits me perfectly it hides flaws in your figure and is nice enough that it can be worn to the office and then out later for a date or dinner i did not try on the whiteblack combo because i thought the white top part might be too sheer unlike other reviewers i think the contrast of fabrics works im not sure why there are negative reviews here i must have the right body type for it because i love it,1
8746,I live in a hot and humid climate so this tank is perfect for everyday use you can dress it up or down and the lightweight material keeps you cool i bought it in colors and may go back for more i wish i would have found them sooner,1
8747,I was looking for something for a spring wedding that wasnt too billowy but not overly fitted either as i try to hide leftover postpartum pounds this offered the perfect solution with the slip underneath the looser netted overlay i got the black the overlay is not delicate but not stiff either just good quality that falls beautifully so happy with this dress comfortable attractive uniqueand versatile can easily see wearing this to work as well as a wedding,1
8748,It is delightful dreamy and yes it is quite right perfect fit i wear a size and it was right on,1
8749,I saw the cream top online and loved it but it is even prettier in person i typically purchase petite sizes online but i tried on the in the store and it fit nicely not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned but the length was just right and the armschest fit perfectly for reference im lbs b this will look great with skinny pants or jeans,1
8750,This boiled wool jacket is warm and cozy it does run a little big i have to fold the sleeves twice but it looks great and i got compliments immediately,1
8751,Bought the camel color and love it nice for cool evenings and mornings spring through fall soft and comfortable delicate yet not too much so that you wouldnt wear often,1
8752,Great style,1
8753,I have loved the pilcrow hyphen chinos and have purchased many pairs however the last pairs ive ordered are all a different cut now they are no longer the chino i loved although they have the exact same name they are now boy cut and are much more narrow through the hips and thighs nowhere on the description does it say boy cut its not until the package arrives in the mail that im saddened to find this changed product with the same number it really should say this int he descri,0
8754,These shorts just didnt work for me i loved the embroidery and the color but i just dont have the curves for them try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure,0
8755,I was in love with this top from the moment i put it on it is of high quality with layers to ensure the top isnt sheer the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and dont show off any of my bra which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits o,1
8756,This is a nice easy go to shirt that i will be grabbing for this fall comfy but still styled to add a little fun in the everyday white tee,1
8757,While this shirt does run a little large i am and ordered a petite small it is perfect for layering under a loose cardigan can be dressed up or down looking forward to wearing it this summer,1
8758,Love this top runs true to size exactly as pictured,1
8759,Very happy with this online dress purchase it fits tts and i love the ruching ive already gotten compliments on it,1
8760,This dress is very comfy and soft i am returning because i didnt like it being a turtle neck just a personal dislike,1
8761,I wore this blazer for one day didnt do anything strenuous and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back next to the center seam its completely unfixable since its not the seam that split but the fabric itself what a waste of moneyas to the fit it is a boxy cut through the waist it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it so its good over something cuteor it would be if it didnt fall apart,0
8762,Cozy and nice quality great fit and runs true to size could wear this every day,1
8763,For me this is the perfect tshirt love the shape size material etc just really like it flattering and good quality,1
8764,This dress is cut perfectly to have a lot of movement love the colors i went with my usual size and it fit generously i am and the size hit about the same as the model my only complaint it came really wrinkled and will definitely not make a travel dress,1
8765,I so wanted to love this sweatshirt it is very soft and seems like excellent quality and material the pattern is pretty and i envisioned spending hours cuddled up reading in it unfortunately the body of the sweatshirt particularly the front torso area was too big and it popped out around me like a balloon the arms fit well so i dont think that i could have gone down a size i was also not keen on the way the neck hung which was either very stiff and tall around my neck when unfolded,0
8766,Yesyou need these so comfortable and wash up perfectly workout walking or great to sleep in,1
8767,This dress is gorgeous i sized up from my usual to an cause im not much for form fitted dresses however it was still pretty body con for me i passed in it for now but in the future i might try a petite the color is a nice brick red with a textured whitish pattern and it is soft like i wanted to snuggle up on the couch in it but i had to refrain ive been having bad luck with zippers from retailer dresses recently but this one was smooth sailing and pretty too the length wa,1
8768,Saw this in the store and loved it the photos on line do not do this justice material is soft and substantial if you love the look of raw edge youll love this piece as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only but kept it and love it,1
8769,They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort,1
8770,Like the other reviewer said theres a nice inner lining and the material of the jacket is just so nice looks a little like a blazer when worn but the heather gray makes it a dress up or down sort of piece,1
8771,I tried this on in a medium in the store and it was too big overall i thought it was a nice concept for a feminine whimsical top so i ordered a small online but even then a small is still too big and i usually wear a medium or an in tops maybe if it was slimmer through the ribswaist area it could work but it just ends up looking maternityish and too voluminous everywhere below the bust the front was too short as well stopped higher than what is shown on the model and im assuming sh,0
8772,Great material pattern and cut perfect summer top,1
8773,Great really soft hoodie i got an xxs petite and its still a little big but it works im lbs,1
8774,I dont usually wear maxi dresses because i am tall so they usually arent maxi on me im also hourglass shaped and maxis with no waist definition make me look frumpy this dress solves both those problems its very long and the waist has attached ties to define and keep it from being too billowy its also lined to the knees so you can wear with confidence but still have the bottom be light and breezy,1
8775,Huge normally wear a medium and this was huge and very unflattering,0
8776,I recently ordered this and am so glad i did i absolutely love it my hips and butt are not tiny so i was very nervous that this would be a giant pouf on my lower half but it lays perfectly flat and has a very gentle aline contrary to other comments i am and but the xs fits perfectly and keeps me looking trim the waist sits just barely below my natural waist very happy with this purchase would buy more if there were additional colors who doesnt love an elasticwaisted skirt,1
8777,I wore this dress to my work christmas party and got compliments all night its a beautiful dress with fantastic details and it is very comfortable i am and about lbs i am typically a on top waist and bottom i ordered the and it was the right choice for me it was a little snug on the bum and around the thighs it pulled ever so slightly in the front but it still looked good its stretchy without looking like it is stretchy the top part of the dress fit well and,1
8778,Saw this skirt in the store but the size was wrong i am normally a or at retailer but i was afraid that the would be just too much material so i ordered the and boy am i gladelegant can go from day to night with the right shoes and accessoriesanticipating many compliments,1
8779,This is a must have for summer im always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesnt look right the short sleeves are just what ive been looking for every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms so i think for everyone else your normal jacket size should be perfect,1
8780,I tried on this skirt in stores and loved it the only thing is im usually a or a and had to buy a for reference im and about pounds if you want to tuck a light sweater or really anything in id recommend you go up a size as well,1
8781,Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these,1
8782,If you love denim skirts as much or more than you love the perfect pair of jeans then youll love this one the waist fits perfectly with just enough give from the spandex to make this skirt comfortable all day without stretching so much that youll wonder if you shouldve bought a smaller size its also a great length for fallwinter and looks fabulous with boots i just wish i could find the perfect buttondown shirt so i can tuck it in and show off the cute detail buckle in back,1
8783,Love these pants the print is very different a little quirky but black and light golden brown mixed together so very versatile i have very thin legs and these are actually tight on me so maybe too slim for somegood length they actually hit right at the ankle,1
8784,I usually size up with this brand small was perfect for me at lbs this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms,1
8785,I love this top very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways it is tight on the bottom i usually wear an xs and lbs had to exchange for a small very flattering liked it so much i ordered it in both colors,1
8786,I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable ill get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain,1
8787,The picture makes the shorts look structured i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester also this runs way too big i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xsi wouldnt even buy this at the sale price,0
8788,Nice thick material cream has lining underneath which i appreciated so that its not sheer in the light flattering design,1
8789,First of all it arrived rolled in a tight ball the size of a large starbucks coffee i dont know why they do that youre not going to be immediately impressed by something that is packaged like its cheap second im usually a in retailer and mine is no where near as loosefitting as the photo also he sleeves and back are a very thin waffle knit like a flimsy tshirt and seethru the sleeves formfit to my arms so i couldnt layer under it but i couldnt wear it alone with the fa,0
8790,I typically wear a size xl in anything from retailer and i ordered this top in an xl its more of a tshirt with buttons than a blouse and it was overall too huge its nice to have extended size options but even if i went down to a size l this would have looked like a maternity top on me,0
8791,This shirt is so comfortable soft and super cute definitely recommend,1
8792,Cute and great fitting pant love the pattern and it fit tts for the brand i normally wear a and i took at flattering,1
8793,I was on the fence about getting this maxi because its a tad pricey but ended up scoring an retailer coupon that took a bit of the sting out of the price im so glad i went ahead and ordered it its absolutely lovely im and got an xs petite it fits like a glove and is the perfect length to wear with either flats or a higher heel love love love,1
8794,This is a beautiful top i purchased this in the greenmoss color its reminds me of a vintage looking bluegreen it fits generously has more of a swing style to it i love it i think it is romantic and feminine glad i made the purchase simply beautiful,1
8795,Fun detail with the beading and lace arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected but thats the style of the piece the fit was tts with those proportions mind the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up it might be a little longer in the body but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change the material isnt too thick so its a nice lighter layer for fallspring really love it,1
8796,I really like this dress i wish they still had xxs p as the xs p is still a little big i guess ti is the style i love the eyelet design the high low is very flattering and the neckline too very comfortable i am not sure if i will keep it as i still think the xxs p would be more flattering but i like it enough to consider keeping the bigger sizenice with a jeans jacket and brown clogs lbs dd in waist,1
8797,This shirt fits true to size i love the cut of the shirt which adds some edge to a basic tee i know i will wear this all the time throughout the fall and winter months perfect to wear as is or layer with cardigans jackets and scarves in cooler weather,1
8798,This is such a great top for spring and summer ive worn it with shorts capris and jeans as well as layered it under a denim jacket it brings an element of whimsy to any outfit its comfortable and really well made,1
8799,Unlike the other reviewers i did not have any problem with the sizing fit or length of this skirt it is a midi skirt so i think its suppose to be a little bit longer for me it fit true to size for reference i am pounds and the size fit perfectly i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good,1
8800,Such a beautiful wellmade dress the color of the dress is slightly more pink in person a very pale pink the lining is an offwhite color it fits very well aside from being a bit long im and ordered the xxs petite so glad paper crown is making xxs p now,1
8801,Got this dress in the blue and cream and its gorgeous i love that its work and date night appropriate but so comfy i am but have very short legs so its hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that doesnt drag on the ground this floats beautifully above my ankles a little lower than on the model but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels i got the small and it fits great the print is lovely the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some,1
8802,I like this top a lot and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area i do not have a large chest and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort leveland it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath i dont prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the,1
8803,I love this dress i believe the picture online doesnt show the unique pattern and design it does have an interesting design add a long vest statement necklace and boots you will be quite fashionable,1
8804,I have been living in mine since i bought it so comfy and dressier than a plain sweatshirt,1
8805,This is a love at first sight item bought that home after seeing it on the model very soft and lovely especially love the tie back i wore it with a t shirt underneath i am and size small i bought xs and still a bit long wish they have petite at the store,1
8806,I love cotton fabric so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors i have the dark redburnt orange color and it is pretty but i have worn the thing once and today when i put it on again i found holes on the front of the shirt so disappointed,0
8807,This top has a nice design i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area which i could have easily fixed it is very sheer even with a nude bra my bra was too visible for my comfort plan on wearing a full camisole underneath tank or bralette you are fine with being on display,0
8808,A great staple to pull out on chilly mornings i am so the arm length was perfect,1
8809,Im too tall for this back goes halfway up my back cannot do much with it other than front tie fabric is not soft at all not impressed returned it,0
8810,Ive been looking for an off the should sweater like this for over a year looks great on and doesnt itch cant wait for fall so i can wear it,1
8811,Lovely top with details and a unique color i have read some other reviews and i honestly dont know why it is getting bad reviews it is linen but not scratchy by any means like linen it does give with wear so i recommend sizing down as it does run a little large with a nude bra you wont see your straps and i would dryel this no washing of any kind linen shrinks overall great top and i was glad i snatched one up,1
8812,High quality fabric and lots of bottom back coverage also it did not cut into my hips which is fabulous so if youre looking for a little more coverage this is your bottom i found it true to sizeim and lbs and i got a size,1
8813,I love this sweater it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe i live in minnesota so a fashionable throwonandgo sweater is essential this sweater fits the bill i love how soft and warm it is the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylicnylonwool material keep it functional warm and cozy i love anything with pockets which this has i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short i did not find that to be true for me and i ordere,1
8814,I purchased these jeans because they were on sale and i figured theyd be a good alt to my other white denim jeans these have by far exceeded my expectations my fav jeans period im but have a long torso and though west size am athletic and curvy so petite jeans dont really work for me these are just the best cut and fit,1
8815,I received tons of compliments on this dress the print is fun and works well with the modest shape i love the high neckline and the long hem its different and coolmy only complaint the arm holes fall super low i didnt realize until i looked at photos but my bra was very visible,1
8816,Bought them in store and have worn them twice very flattering they have maintained their shape through the day im and usually wear a inseam and these are perfect ankle length im tempted to buy another color,1
8817,I love the color of this cardigan and the cashmere is very soft i love the detail in the stitching and how the zipper is covered i do wish it were a bit longer but its definitely a keeper,1
8818,I bought all colors and couldnt be happier love the cut fabric and colors the fabric is light enough to wear in the hot summer of charleston sc but not so light that you can see thru it i love flowing tops in the summer that dont stick to you and this cut does that and is flattering as well ive already work with shorts and a skirt both looked great easy to accessorize,1
8819,Runs big so size down i love this top for many reasons but armholes are big so went to xs and i am usually a small or medium xs was perfect and still long enough for me gorgeous fabric and color and flow got tons of compliments very feminine and comfy looks great with jeans and white crops,1
8820,Putting my two cents in regarding how fantastic this dress is i bought the medium petite in navy stripe it fits great its not too clingy and its flattering to my disproportionate figure makes me look more hourglass,1
8821,Its lightweight which is perfect for summer officewear when i dont want bare arms my fear with buying any white shirt is that it will be too sheer this shirt is sheer but not as much as most in part due to the pattern that camouflages any sheerness i dont find it to be see through when wearing a nude colored bra that matches my skintone exactly ive worn it to work with a nude bra and it was a great transition shirt between the office and happy hour i went a size up to a small becaus,1
8822,Color is very nice and dark with just a little fading around the knee i sized down to from my usual lb,1
8823,This is the perfect dress for going out and wearing to work with a jacket or sweater and boots it fits perfectly across the bust and waist and then has enough room to glide over the hipsthe material is structured enough to give me a nice curvy shape and the embroidery is well done and beautiful my husband picked this out from the catalog and loved it on me as well,1
8824,I love this romper i am and the medium fit great and wasnt long im short so i thought i would have to hem this its comfortable and although im not a huge fan of gauze the fit was perfect i had tosnatch it,1
8825,I really love these pants just the right fabric not too thick so comfy i do feel they run a bit big they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized choose the smaller one,1
8826,The style plaid colors cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics looks like it will be very cool airy for these brutal hot days ordered both the blue purple in the size for length did not disappoint at all looks pretty much on me as in the pic a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt thruout the plaid its a silver metallic on the blue raspberry on the purple plaid not obvious from far away but noticeable up close a cute feature,1
8827,I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints however they are too sheer i dont want to wear a tank top but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer i can also see the fabric tearing easily it is too delicate i sent both colors back what a waste because the prints and colors are good these tops are also not for busty ladies i have a big bust and the top part didnt cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st,0
8828,These pants looked worn washed old looking when i received them the quality is super thin cotton as if its been washed a million times is about to fall apart the workmanship is terrible you can see loose stitching all over the top portion is too tight looks terrible stretched out i liked absolutely nothing about this pants except the idea of them from the picture online,0
8829,I got this piece because it was so unique thats one of the things i love so much about retailer not afraid to go where no woman has gone before so i ordered it in a p my usual size and a i am petite but the worked perfectly i think i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the p was too small all over so i would agree that it runs smallthe quality is excellent the look is great my husband liked it on me it might work for the office with so,1
8830,I saw this dress online and thought it looked just ok i happened to see the dress in my retailer store today and thought i would try it im so glad i did this dress looks so much better on im usually a in dresses at retailer i tried this in a large it fit perfect its doesnt cling to you but it doesnt hang like a sack either i think it made me look taller and thin woohoo i would say its a little on the thinner side its not a heavy knit its two layers of thinner knit as yo,1
8831,If you care that its sheer be forewarned i probably wont wear a cami under it as its not terrible but worth noting that said its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best its cut quite generously and i do wish id gone down a size,1
8832,I had high hopes for this dress but unfortunately was disappointed and returned the dress it flares out with too much material under the gathered waist its so odd,0
8833,I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying maternityand this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing its not that it runs big its supposed to swingflow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because its a little thicker fabric so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut but i lov,1
8834,Saw this online when it first came up and thought it looked lovely i purchased a different pleated dress and decided i didnt need a second pleated dress was at my local retailer and they had one pink dress in a size and a blue in a decided to try them both on the zero actually fit perfectly and at the sale price i had to have it the material is beautiful little details like the ruffled hem are lovely one i will wear for years thinking about getting the link but the blue is lovely im,1
8835,Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldnt be happier shes a size c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable highly recommend,1
8836,Gorgeous purchased in red color is glowing if you have warm complexioncool undertones,1
8837,Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes this shirt meets both requirement it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up must have for fall and winter,1
8838,I really like both colors in this top i love the way it lays the length the material etc what i dont like is that the arm holes are very large and shows the entire side of your bra this is definitely a summer top so why would someone want to have to wear a cami when its warm enough to go sleeveless too bad i would have bought it for sure,0
8839,I absolutely adore this shirt the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be the way it hangs or somethingnot really sure nonetheless it is perfect can be dressed up or down which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing i can tell im going to get a lot of wear out of it,1
8840,The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable,1
8841,Just purchased tonight and love i this little jacket the embroidery and beading down the sleeves is such an interesting touch yet neutral enough to wear with just about everything this fall runs tts,1
8842,Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer first thing i did was touch it to feel if its soft and it felt like butta surprisingly its a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking i hate turtleneck choke and big cowl neck reminds me of the s but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus since i,1
8843,So soft and comfortable and flattering on run small im a pant and a small in these is as small as id want to go otherwise excellent,1
8844,I ordered the blue in size xl its even prettier in person the fit runs a little smallershorter on me than shown on the model im ft in for reference i love the detailed stitching it is delicate and can catch my dogs claw pulled on it and i had to reweave the thread back ive washed mine twice reshaped airdried it didnt shrink much at all its perfect for spring summer ive gotten a lot of compliments on the shade of blue its really so pretty,1
8845,I was really excited about this skirt because i love the color however when i tried it on it was too much of a highlow i am not very tall but this would look a lot better on a tall person,0
8846,What a fabulous find i purchased the grey and it looks great with different shades of blue jeans i am lbs and wear a size c and the medium fits wonderful was worried it would run short as i am long waisted but fits just a bit shorted then pictured i love tucking the front in and letting the back hang out,1
8847,I ordered the black and white version online and the dress fit perfectly it was very wellmade with a nicely textured heavier cloth and the overall appearance is very classy it is a versatile dress and i would highly recommend it,1
8848,I found this pretty sweater to run true to size i am between a size large and extra large and the large fit well it is perfect in the shoulders and body skimming without being too flared at the hem the lavender is a dreamy light sky blue true to what my monitor shows i rarely wear anything but black and gray but i could not resist this color the sweater is a medium weight and i anticipate wearing this at the beach with white jeans and now with pale gray narrow wool pants i really like th,1
8849,Love this top kept looking online but really wanted to try on so once i made it to a store i was so happy they had my size im but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length i got the xs and it is a lovely fit tts love the colors in the pink top,1
8850,This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer ranna gill i just love this gorgeous free spirited dress i bought the regular medium for my f size figure it works very well i will want to wear a black cami as im not comfortable with some cleavage showing maybe and the open lines of lacy small holes down the front and back you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami the top is not very seethrough and the skirt is lined the re,1
8851,This dress arrived today and it is both flattering and comfortable i am just a smidge under and i ordered a regular xs in the front it hit me about above the knee it is office appropriate for a business casual environment the red was deeper in color than i expected it seemed a little brighter on my monitor but this is no problem for me it is still a great color i tried it with clogs knee boots and ankle boots all really cute and as and added bonus it looks good with b,1
8852,Like the previous reviewer my size p gaped and strained the buttons at my chest dd wide rib cage also the skirt flared out too high on my waist im going to try a regular with hope the torso will fit better other than the fit on my particular body and the one distracting chest pocket this shirt dress is very well made very cute,1
8853,These menswear inspired trouser and beyond cute and comfy great color and fit soft interior dress up with a blazer or go casua with a tee adorable,1
8854,This is much prettier online than on me too much dress even though i sized down,0
8855,Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me i am and curvy and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and arent long enough or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering however this pair exceeded all my expectations first they are just plain pretty the pattern and colors are lovely the blue at the ankle is a cute touch the fabric is soft and slightly drapey but substantial enough for warmth and not seethrough at all i also like how the waist is,1
8856,I loved the colors especially the pink and thought this would be really pretty however when i received it its much shinier with is a very thin material and is a bit of a retro in a not nice way feel to it i also found it huge normally i wear an xxsp or a p for reference i am e and in waist i tried both the xxsp fit better but was too short and the xxs too large i had hoped this would have more shape and would be more fitted but its definitely not,0
8857,When i opened the package i knew i was in love the colors are vibranttrue to the photo the fabric is delicious soft and silky the perfect weight for a warm summer day these can be dressed up or down i am lbs i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of roomi would highly reccomend these shortsjust gorgeous come on summer,1
8858,Tried one at the store love the look and feel of this pants so soft and flowy sizing runs large for reference im and lbs xxsp fits just right highly recommended,1
8859,Love it the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim,1
8860,I definitely agree with the other reviews however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up or down as well as color options the tricky thing is that it runs super small im usually between a or and ended up getting a size i dont like high waisted skirts or pants so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable maybe best to try on in store but worth it,1
8861,Great jeans especially if you are on the shorter side ft for example they run very large i typically buy size and bought a size and had a tailor take in the waist a bit im syked for these for fall,1
8862,Very disappointed when i received this the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that first it is nearly a crop top second it is boxy and its attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky third need to size down sizes had to return this,0
8863,Tried this lovely navy dress on in the store in a size and it was perfect wish there had been a petite available to try since the hem fell below the knees on me and it would have to be hemmed the crisscross on the front is very flattering to the waistline and i love the see through fabric along the shoulders and back its stretchy too,1
8864,I thought the sweater was pricey until i saw it on me this sweater is really flattering i chose the grey colored one im smaller on top and this sweater is perfect with the v neck cut out the fabric is also really soft,1
8865,Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer easy to wearno special bra needed thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan i wear a p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy i bought the p i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip,1
8866,Its really a casual tee but with the cute pattern that gives a pop of color it can have a little more dressed to go out look i thought it might be a bit wide by the picture but has a nice flattering flow a bit expensive at full price but an amazing score on sale,1
8867,Im c jeans size dress one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on the sleeves are no joke serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots but is surprisingly chic the one i purchased was a medium never had an opportunity to try a small which i suspect is my actual size buying it oversized made this magical it feels modern i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me it makes the sleeves less cartoonish,1
8868,Beautiful colors lightweight flannel so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round i ordered a s my typical size which turned out to be quite large on me hopefully the xs will fit better,1
8869,This is a basic henley and it is made well a wardrobe staple for sure the cut is flattering and the material is soft i ordered the small which is tight fitting im a c for reference,1
8870,I ordered this in size xl and ended up returning it as soon as i received it the color was just as pretty in person the thick eyelet panel was well done the problem is the whole tank was much smallertighter than pictured i have several tops from this maker and was surprised how this was cut too small compared to their normal fit im pearshaped so the hip area looked terrible but the whole top just wasnt up to the typical fitting standards for xl retailer has done much better in the pas,0
8871,Nice non clingy cut has details so more than a basic tshirt,1
8872,I absolutely love everything about this top i got compliments the first time i wore it i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer the neckline and sleeves seem tailorfitted for my body i dont often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect lengthshape to be incredibly flattering theyre in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regularlength the neckline is equally perfect and hugs my curves beautifully wit,1
8873,Bought this blouse to wear with high wasted jeans and pants it lays beautifully and can be dressed up or down its somewhat sheer but i dont plan on wearing a cami under it perfect for work or going out,1
8874,What a cute shirt i got the red and white and its definitely a summer shirt although im sure you could make it look cute under a cardigan im a m and the m fit well tts,1
8875,Perfect in every way easy to wearvery feminine comfy and goes with everything only problem is color is not like picture it is a mauve not a light pink i still love this top and the color it camre in brighten up with lipstick necklace earrings whatever your pick highly recommend a winner,1
8876,These shorts are ageappropriate for all theyre loose fitting and cal me rolled up or left down where they end above the knee the fabric is soft and colors are fun,1
8877,Oh elevenses i love your pantsthe fabrics the details the length ive found elevenses to be classic work pants reliable professional well made these are none of those things the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher thats it appears in the picture the red pair are thin stretchy and cheap both pairs have to go back im truly sad,0
8878,This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend the first time i wore it i received so many compliments,1
8879,Everything about this dress is perfectthe material style and fit flattering and comfortable im and the length was just above the knee you can dress it up or down comfortable i definitely recommend,1
8880,I bought the denim ch rocket highrise crop last spring and had so much fun wearing them that i had to scoop up these babys when i saw black same fantastic fit only i had to size up so i assuming they run small in black i could sleep in these they are this comfy and so flattering ive got a flat behind and the placement of the pockets really give that lift i need in back id buy one in every color if i could so worth that price tag,1
8881,I ordered this online and love it the fabric feels nice and it if fitted on the top then the bottom flows i ordered a which is my normal dress size and it fit perfect comes a little above my knees im,1
8882,I saw this in the kelly green color one size larger than my normal it didnt look much but i was so drawn to the very pretty green color so i tried it on anyway boy am i really glad i did this is more than just your basic everyday tee the back has a very cute gingham pleating detail that hangs well when paired with a skinny jean or leggings material was pretty substantial for a tee and definitely not seethrough i am a true m on most retailer tops and this one is pretty true to size the on,1
8883,This is such a nice little sweater to add to a dress or tank fits true to size and i love the tie and hook and eye closure quality,1
8884,Love love love i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item its gorgeous and incredibly flattering runs large its drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size which isnt an issue i usually run into its quickly become a great staple for work definitely pair it with bodycon pants leggings skinny jeans and it looks unique and very professional,1
8885,A beautiful shawl but not practical i was impressed with how elegantromantic it first feltlooked however after minutes of wear it would not stay on my shoulders the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different topstanks underneath i kept running into the same problem lovely for the first minutes of wear and then awkwardlyannoyingly wouldnt stay on my shoulders the neckline is undefined and it just fell off not a great design disappointedly returned it,0
8886,These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either but i thought id give it another shot never again im on my th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completelyi mean huge holes in the fabric where its just disintegrated even at extra off the sale price its not worth it the full price,0
8887,Maybe its because im but this top was underwhelming i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big obnoxious bow on the back it does look cute on the model so maybe its a younger top i would have felt silly wearing it,0
8888,Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium i have fairly broad shoulders and thought i might not fit my usual small if it helps for reference i am lbs and wear a c bra i first tried on the small and didnt even bother opening the medium i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size with this blouse the buttons dont pull at a,1
8889,Im so glad i saw this in the store as the online photo does not do it justice its elegant detailed and a beautiful shade of pink it has a little silver sparkle which makes it perfect for a casual party when you want to opt out of the traditional holiday colors,1
8890,This top couldve been one of my favorites ever i ordered the rose option and was planning on ordering another color the fabric is super thin but i was able to wear wo an extra tank unfortunately after wears several small holes appeared around the neckunder the ruffle i washed this top on hand wash cycle and hung to dry when i came to read the reviews i noticed i wasnt the only customer with this issue,0
8891,This dress is amazing beautiful and perfect for fall the colors and beading are so much better in person the pockets are an added bonus im typically a xs but sized up to a s only because i felt the sleeves were tight and across the bust was tighter than id like when moving my arms the xs would have worked but the s is perfect comfort i highly recommend this beauty for reference im lbs,1
8892,I ordered the greenteal in size xl the fit on me doesnt match the model it looks looser on her i think it runs small at least in size xl it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt its a beautiful color of green too i think the vneck is too low so i wear a tank underneath this also helps with the transparent panels at the shouldersback my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s,1
8893,Id been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations wellmade lovely color very soft flattering cut it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s its warm and the lining is very pretty hopefully itll hold up to daily wear id definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall spring i got the plum color,1
8894,This is a perfect jacket over any shirt tee or dress jacket is well made and goes with anything,1
8895,I got this top in whiterust and it is darling the lining keeps it from being too see through the bell sleeves add style without getting in the way thanks to the shorter length i get many compliments each time i wear it i am lbs and take xs fit was true to size,1
8896,This jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif however it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store this piece will look badwornold in a very short period of time its a big shame because its so perfect in every other way i choose not to buy it its very expensive for the quality,0
8897,I love this tee i bought the red and it is just so cute the background is a light pink and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose which looks great over this tee buy it,1
8898,This top is a great neutral layering piece with some nice visual interest the blackandwhite pattern and tieneck style will add a little something to a cardigan or blazer the neck can also be tied multiple ways its definitely appropriate for work and i found it tts i normally wear a m and took an m in this top,1
8899,Great shirt i couldnt picture the material but its washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling,1
8900,This dress is stunning i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it initially i thought it was supposed to be that way but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out but it is totally worth it,1
8901,These pants are so soft and comfortable the colors are great too cant wait to buy more in other colors,1
8902,This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter i am a size and the medium was perfect buy this now,1
8903,For reference im currently hovering in the range for pants called curvy on the lower half hahaha but purchased these in a they are so flattering and comfortable i returned to purchase a pair to keep stashed for when i wear out a pair and actually bought two pairs in a size for when i loose weight they look perfectly tailored the fabric is substantial more of a spring weight than summer so you dont have to worry about showing skin beneath the unlined pant and it drapes e,1
8904,This top is very cute the fit is great and the material is very comfortable i am a lbs and wear a d and the medium fit great,1
8905,Wow i got this top in blue and im in love love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint i sized a bit down usually get a and i got a since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau tank in the bank i find it really classy like your ontrend but not trying to bare too much skin i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that its very upscale looking in the navy would totally buy different colors if it came in others but im no,1
8906,I am so at the tall end of petit and this is the perfect length i havent really done midi dresses before because i feel make me look stout this is not the case it hits midcalf the fabric is very thick although for polyester i think its kind of pricey im going to keep it anyways it doesnt look or feel cheap and i think it will be good for travel because i dont think it wrinkles easily the ribbon hits in a very flattering place right above the waist i have a very athletic,1
8907,I was so excited when i ordered this i love comfy clothing this looked perfect when i received it there was a weird smell with the top convinced that this could be from storage or something i washed it the smell did not go away i have washed it times now and the smell will not disappear i have not yet worn but as i have washed it not able to return it the top looks and feels great just the weird smell now i am stuck,0
8908,I have this in the blueteal color and i love it so far im considering buying it in other colors this tee is stretchy comfortable and soft even after being washed a few times it fit true to size on me xs although its a bit formhugging so if you want a looser fit consider sizing up the only thing about the blue is that its not quite as dark as in the photo on the website i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often,1
8909,Bought on a whim as a gift for my mom fit perfectly and she loved the details did not complain of itching as with prior review it is more blue than gray appearing the photo,1
8910,The simple shape of this silky comfortable shift is transported by the fun psychedelic pattern the fabric is lightweight and drapes very nicely because of the lining i purchased the size petite to accommodate my dd bustwide rib cage and it fits perfectly the high neck is fastened with a single hook versatile and comfortable and a clear winner for spring and summer for sizing reference my other stats are tall ml on top sm on bottom,1
8911,This dress fulfills a gap in my wardrobe that ive long wanted to fill that of the perfect springtime dress i got the sky blue color in a size for reference i am lbs and and it fits like a glove the color is vivid and the overall effect of the dress is simple and romantic ill be wearing it with casual cognac sandals a floppy straw hat and minimal makeup,1
8912,This is a fun dress to have in your closet i ordered the p and it was just a little to short for my taste had the regular sent and it was perfect i wore it the very next night to a party feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves,1
8913,This shirt appears nice in the pictures it appears to have a bit of style wrong the shirt is one of the thinnest fabrics ive ever purchased i live in warmer climate and its nice to have different cotton shirts with some style this shirt has no style and i thought it would i have purchased this brand before and thought this fabric would be similar the other shirts were way nicer softer and had a different level of construction i wanted to wear this shirt out and when i put it on it w,0
8914,This skirt is super cute and versatile dressed up but still pretty casual with a sweater tights and boots id say true to size or maybe runs a little on the large side definitely doesnt run small love it,1
8915,My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter,1
8916,The material is horrible its heavy and cheap the skirt does not flow as it appears in the photo instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles am returning,0
8917,You just cant go wrong with a perfect white top im usually xs or s and got this top in xs the fit is perfect the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you cant really see in the picture the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants it can easily be dressed up or down,1
8918,The blue version of this dress originally caught my eye online but wasnt available in the store so i tried the green one mainly for size since everyone said it runs a bit small i did have to size up one or two sizes i fell in love with the green dress and bought it it is so comfortable great quality fabric not too thin or too heavy looks great on i have received several compliments,1
8919,I love this jacket i was hesitant to order but im so glad i did its such a cute unique blazer to add to my wardrobe fit is very true to size for a blazer,1
8920,I usually wear a size small in deletta i am and pounds the small ran true to size for me saying that i am a size so usually everywhere else i can take small or medium so i can see how reviewers say it runs big love the ruffles on this tank makes it a little more special super comfy and easy to wear will be great for hot summer days in florida,1
8921,I bought a size small in this dress even though i am usually a large at retailer it just hung strangely and clung to the unflattering parts of my body but seemed very large i loved the feel color grey and style of the dress but i ended up returning it because of the fit it also requires something under it since it is fairly seethrough,0
8922,So cute and comfy great fit i bought them in green and they look great with wedges sneakers or sandals dress up or down pair with a tshirt and cotton blazeradorable,1
8923,I didnt expect the fit to be as cute i am not sure i like how the model is wearing this top but untucked or more tucked both look more falttering on the color is more vibrant in person still light turquoise but richer i dont think i nbeed petite in this as it is blousy but not oversized or boxy,1
8924,I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit i first saw it on blogger amber fillerupclark barefoot blonde and i knew i had to have it this is the first one piece suit ive purchased in about six years ive avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy and the monokini look just looked odd on me i have a smaller frame and a larger bust ddd so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge i am a size but i ordered a size after reading reviews,1
8925,This skirt is a must have it is very classy and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night it is high quality and definitely worth the price i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner and got a lot of compliments comfortable and classy,1
8926,Love this color when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on so pretty if you love pilcro chinosyou will be happy with these same great fit and an awesome color,1
8927,Cute embroidered mixed textiled shirt super comfy maybe runs a little small across chest but has a nice stretch so it accommodates well a great transition piece,1
8928,This sweet little number in the mustard yellow has become my fall and winter goto sweater so easy to wear understated and a bit retro looks great tucked into skirts or highwaisted jeans or out and the subtle shift in textures is a nice detail highly recommend and a great price point,1
8929,Bought this on a whim and am so glad this is made of the softest fabric and the loose flowing nature of the tank make it perfect over a bathing suit,1
8930,I was so excited to order this sweater i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days ordering it on sale made it all the better however when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were with little definition the sweater itself lacks definition as well just shapeless and hangy i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on,0
8931,I was hesitant to buy this dress due to there not being any reviews but decided to take a chance and order it it is fabulous great fit off the shoulder design stays in place and the dress hits the smallest part of my waist perfectly the lace detail on the hem and the tassels on the ties are details that sets this dress apart i wish that it was made in another color perhaps a solid you all hit this one out of the park retailer,1
8932,I dont have anything like it in my closet really excited to wear it,1
8933,I love this top it was cool on a summers day i did get one of the strings of the design snagged but it worked out just fine not ruined at all,1
8934,This dress is gorgeous in color and print i think it can be styled as eclectic or elegant as youd like definitely runs big in the shoulderbodice area so i sized down,1
8935,I tried this one without a bra and t was fine a little droopy but i could go withoutthe things that bothered me the pattern wasnt even on both sides so where the seem is on the legs by the wait didnt match some people may not be annoyed by that but hard for me not to look atalso the length on the model is just below the knee i usually order petite but tried on regular size in the store i liked it like that the hem went to below the big part of my calf so it was flatte,1
8936,I received the pants and they are really nice you can dress them up or down i ordered a size in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs as they were loose i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites i am a size in petites and ordered the size in regular the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult,1
8937,My favorite new dress i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric its very flattering and easy to wear,1
8938,I ordered the dress online this dress looked pretty the material was soft and comfortable the length was perfect but the zipper was totally out of place it bulged out in a weird way which made it look like the dress was torn i had to return the dress i normally dont see a problem at this level in retailer clothes,0
8939,I received this top in white last fri and have already worn it twice it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesnt cling to the body the top layer is flowy and breathable i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months,1
8940,Great fit easy to dress up or down lovely shade of bluethis will be my default dress this summer,1
8941,The drape of this shirt is flattering and i appreciate the longer tail in back the fabric is light and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so california with a sweater it will be great in winter too so far ive worn it with jeans and booties and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down,1
8942,I tried this on in the store on a whimthen had to have it im normally a small but really loved the way the medium fit good thing because it was the last jacket like it in the store super soft comfya great purchase fur is removable for easy washing or a different look,1
8943,The floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy but not with this top im usually wear sm with retailer brand depending with the design this tank has loose bottom section so the s is tts for me,1
8944,Recently wore this lovely dress during business trip was stopped four times while walking thru orlando airport the design is extremely comfortable the print will make you and others smile so elegant and fun the beading on the flowers is elegant such a unique piece,1

8946,Love this sweater so much i purchased the grey and the pink so far no issues with the stitching,1
8947,I purchased this blouse because i love a s vibe in my tops it is a beautiful colorful top but the colors werent flattering on me having said that the cut is nice the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely and the fit was fine on me i am a curvy with a c cup go for it if this is a style you like one other note i wish it had been a bit longer but i am older and prefer a little more coverage its just a personal preference i think the picture is an accurate depiction,1
8948,I love this dress its very cute and comfortable i belted it to give me more of a waistline because otherwise the tented shape overwhelms my short stature i love the strap design at the neckline the off the shoulder sleeves are comfortable i have an xsp which is true to size for me,1
8949,Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor mans pineapple blouse i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me im thus i prefer this blouse i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar if you wear makeup like i do you must find a trick to taking it on and off for me i put it on prior to putting on makeup i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup and dont even think,1
8950,This swimsuit is so beautiful and fits wonderfully and is very flattering comfortable fit as well love it,1
8951,I tried these on in my local store and immediately loved them they are so flattering on my hourglass shape the flare leg balances out the hips great quality and very comfortable i know i will get so much wear out of these i bought a size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly,1
8952,Beautifuldelicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly i love the floral print very appropriate for springsummer i agree with the other reviewers whove mentioned that it runs small i have a bust size of dd and waist size and i had to size up to nevertheless i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out,1
8953,Extremely flattering an easy dress to wear good choice for both day and evening,1
8954,This is my third pair of ag primas i love them the higher rise is nice to keep smooth lines theyre made of such soft material that moves with you rather than restricts you and the cut of the legs is skinny without being skin tight absolutely my favorites jeans retailer sell more washes and ill buy em,1
8955,Sadly this dress was trashed after wearing it for an hour it snagged on everything my watch my purse my necklace i had to go home change and return the dress later impractical fabric ruined an otherwise lovely dress,0
8956,I saw this sweater online and loved it until i tried it on im flat chested pounds and i ordered a size small the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms this sweater will work great if you are short consider making your sweaters a little longer because i do not consider myself tall,0
8957,This top looked positively vulgar on i am a d and it was way too low cutmy boobs were spilling out in addition the fabric reminded me of a cheese clothit just looked and felt cheap unfortunately this top will be going back,0
8958,I got this shirt in red and black both colors vibrant and material of shirt is nice cotton blend will get lots of use from both shirts,1
8959,I finally tried this on now that it went on sale and it was surprisingly flattereing love the blue color and i assume the purple was equally nice fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great long but ok for me,1
8960,I tossed this in my bag online at the last minute thinking id give it a shot so glad i did this is dress is so simple and so much more flattering then i expected you can dress it up or down i wish it was about inch longer but still a good length for me things are always too short for me the material could be a little thicker but then i suppose it would lose the bounce that is so key to the flow of thing with this dress,1
8961,What a special skirt so beautiful great quality i got on sale but still expensive and it was still worth it i will be wearing this for years,1
8962,Beautiful and high quality unfortunately it made me look topheavy i am a dd,1
8963,I really wanted to love this cardigan and did until i tried it on the arms are so tight i ordered in a m which is my normal retailer size but couldnt move my arms took it back was going to try in a l but store didnt have any for the price i need to be able to move my arms,0
8964,Its too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i cant wait for cooler weather i tried it on with skinny jeans and its darling love how its much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum perfect for leggings nice slim but not tight fit,1
8965,I got some nice things for christmas but this along with the matching leggings was hands down my absolute favorite gift so stylish so cozy the perfect length to cover your bottom the perfect fit dd and ordered an xl love the pockets i could go on and on the perfect set to lounge around the house in sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them when i say it is the perfect fit it is oversized not huge but it is roomy and thats how i like it as loungewear,1
8966,I love this flattering and comfortable jacket it has a nice stretch and the color is out of this world i think it will pack a big punch this fall,1
8967,This shirt is structured enough to wear to work and flirty enough to wear out on the town the details around the neck and the bottom make it very unique i paired it with a chunky necklace and got tons of compliments however i could imagine this shirt may not work for those with a bigger bust line as there isnt much give in that area,1
8968,Gorgeous embroidery soft fabric great drape hides tummyoverall perfect size down i bought the small and i am dd,1
8969,Lovely body hugging dress hits just below the knee great with boots as shown or with heels very soft material and the peppery color is really pretty i can see myself wearing this to work and out at night this is a winner,1
8970,These are very pretty but i have had a few problems with them out of the package i found them to be true to size i think i purchased the pxxs or the pxs however even though they are machine washable i feel that they shrunk upon washing and are now too short i am barely over tall also the elastic waistband keeps twisting within the casing which drives me crazy i have to keep straightening it i think there are better options for sleep pants,0
8971,I was so lucky to find these jeans in store yesterday and they are the most comfortable jeans ive ever had the fit is amazing and wish they werent sold out online or i would buy more,1
8972,months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant went to a dr apt and the receptionist loved this shirt i told her it was nonmaternity and she can buy it at retailer i think she stopped by on her way home from work,1
8973,Soft and cozy not itchy at all and it has pockets i am lbs dd bra and take this in size small,1
8974,Im and the xs swallowed me like a snuggie i suppose the tons of fabric might drape nicely if youre and above it drooped and hung comically large from every angle under arm body and skirt a belt was no match for that much fabric the colors are gorgeous and it appeared well made but the design was awful,0
8975,Love the unique details and neutral color scheme top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my lb frame its comfortable and well made thicker material seems to be holding up fine after one washing looks great with skinny jeans highly recommend,1
8976,Needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored topshei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint they fit like a glove and are true to size i dont think the picture does them justice if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer i would not hesitate to purchase them,1
8977,I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves they were right the way its seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that its incredibly flattering the fabric is light enough for warm weather though it may be too heavy for hot weather its soft and has a very flattering n,1
8978,These are my new favorite leggings they have everything i need soft waist band that doesnt squeeze me at all not overly long subtle ribbed texture black pair that make them feel just a little nicer and most importantly they are not see thru at all so soft on the inside too and this price is nuts too im so happy with these,1
8979,I love this dress i have an hour glass figure and the dress is very flattering on me i didnt encounter a problem with the colors or pattern as others have stated,1
8980,Aesthetically pleasing and very wellmade love it but does run large,1

8982,I love this romper so much im a tall girl so often times its hard for me to find a romper that isnt too short the length on this is perfect this romper is an adorable design and the fit is great the material is a great quality and its really comfortable im b bra i usually range between an xs and s i went with the s on this one and it fits great i definitely recommend this if youre thinking about it,1
8983,I loved the design online but the sweater is bulky and boxy i had chosen the cream with blue and now looking back at the other pictures of the beigecream it represents it better it made me look very wide loved it online but it wasnt for me returned it,0

8985,Love this topthe fit is perfectionthe fabric is wonderfully softi ordered the green love this colorwill be ordering it in the grey alsofits very true to size,1
8986,This skirt is absolutely beautiful in person the metallic thread is a subtle stunning addition to this elegant piece like the last person mentioned it is thick but i think it makes it look full rather than like a bag i think the extra fabricweight adds a more classictraditional look to it making it look more like a wool skirt from the s s or s if youre not a fan of that look you probably wont like the way this falls like the description says this is a piece that would neve,1
8987,I love this little vest such an easy outfit completer just throw it on over jeans and a tank or long sleeves and voilaeffortlessly chic the colors pop and its the perfect length if youre on the fence with this one definitely give it a try you wont be disappointed,1
8988,The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings or traveling love this dress not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress extremely comfortably and beautiful i cant recall the last time i bought a new dress,1
8989,Love love love i have both colors and wear with leggings its not a heavy sweater and has a great drape super flattering im usually a medium and it runs true to size not supposed to be tight i find it a little low in the frontbut a tank underneath takes of it washes well,1
8990,These corduroys are perfect the flare is just enough to be current without seeming overly trendy or costumey they make my legs look super long and look great with a professional top or my favorite with a drapery tshirt half tuckedthey are pretty long im with pretty long legs and i could use a hem which shouldnt affect the style much until then im wearing them with a inch platform and theyre perfect highly recommend if they still had my size in other colors in stock i wo,1

8992,I bought this for my sister it is perfect for your favorite cat lover the print is adorable up close but not overwhelming to secretly hide your crazy cat lady intentions i love this myself the material is soft and its a perfect flowy blouse for day to night,1
8993,This top is adorable especially the grey check timeless staple with a modern cute update i agree with nd reviewer i dont think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest im also a d i got a small it fits perfectly i wear it all the time i think its great for every season very flattering the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist i get compliments all the time i pair it with cropped sweaters when its cold the grey does seem a bit higher quality the blu,1

8995,I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top when i tried it on i didnt want to take it off its a little bigger than i would like i got a small and am usually between xs and s may have sized down if the top were availablebut the fit and cut are flattering,1
8996,I most often fit into a size medium based on prior reviews i ordered this dress in a small and it fits perfectly it drapes nicely the fabric is soft and flows well the under layer has a nice little stretch to it the dress looks good with and without the belt my favorite and mostslimming look is to just tie cinch and tie it in the back such that it does not wrap around the front at all the dress is so comfortable and the neckline is very flattering no bra needed for my small bust,1
8997,Just bought this in the store a couple days ago and wore it for the first time today love the embroidery detail and i feel that the colors are more vibrant in person i typically wear a in most retailer tops but i got a in this and it is great seems to be a generous fit the slits on the sides do come up a bit high but i wore a cami underneath since it is sheer and the slits were not an issue with it looks great with jeans it is a great transitional piece for the fall as im sure i will,1
8998,This is one of those rare garments that is actually as flattering on me as it looks on the model just like the picture it hangs like a dress and emphasizes my curves without seeming too revealing the weight of the fabric creates graceful movement while the loose cut keeps it cool and breezy for reference i am and curvy d xx and i ordered a small petite this is a smaller size than i would wear in most styles but it fits almost like it was made for me the tie hits slightl,1
8999,I thought these pants had a great fit and the color is fabulous i would have preferred a inch inseam but is by far better than that many designer jeans at department stores run,1
9000,I love this dress its very comfortable slim swing and very ingratiating the fabric is light i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves overall im pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress i will definitely recommend it,1
9001,I loved this dressy ruffle sweatshirt i am long waisted and these often look too short on me but this one fit perfect and actually accentuated my curves in a good way as opposed to making me look puffy,1
9002,Just purchased this on sale will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and dont want your skin to touch the subway bench love it,1
9003,These joggers are so comfortable nice and lightweight and fabric is very soft and a bit stretchy so they move with you beautiful dark navyindigo print very subtle and blends well with many tops perfect length i am lb and purchased xs love them,1
9004,Great piece using as a night gown slept in it last night like a dream,1
9005,Not as cute as photos and too small in chest i am lbs and the small was too tight in the chest and i am not large here at all shoulders and sleeve length fit well will return not comfortable and will need to be able to button it on rainy days,0
9006,At first i thought this sweater might be too boxy but fastened at the waist its very flattering and the collar is faceframing and the coral in particular really more of a mango sorbet shade is unexpected but cheery for winterbut the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets brought a new puppy home just after christmas and this sweater is perfect for layering for late night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats bought it in coral and pink,1
9007,Someone recommended to size up if u have large breast and i am glad i did it fits like a dream this is the cutest dot dress i have ever tried,1
9008,True to size and love the color great to wear dressed up with wedges and a blouse or dressed down with some mephistos and a tee linen fabric makes them light for summer heat,1
9009,This top is true to size and fits perfectly color is very natural,1
9010,I have worn this to work errands yoga its a great tee love it,1
9011,Living in a warm climate im always on the hunt for great springsummer dresses that can be worn to work dinner or just general out and aboutthis dress is a great length with the varied hemline that gives you enough length for work or dinner its also great for a summer cocktail party or afternoon out shopping im a traditional hourglass figure larger on top and bottom with a small waist dress size or depending on the top i roared this in a medium and its perfectly comfy and hang,1
9012,This is really a nice piece briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didnt look quite right but for many others it would work nicely,1
9013,Love the fabric on this so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath this will not be one of those the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesnt feel too delicate the back is a super soft jerseyfeel wonderful will go nicely with jeans flats for me as a super bonus i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party ill be so pretty,1
9014,I love this top its so hard for me to find conservative comfortable and yet not momisn swimsuits this top is amazing its comfortable and soft and great quality im excited to use this suit this season,1
9015,I bought this for our daughter i tried it on when it arrived and the material is fabulous and feels soooo good against the skin the purple is a stunning color very subdued and classy if she does not like it on christmas after gifts are opened guess who is going to keep it for herself if she loves it as much as i think she will then ill just have to get one for myself the pleats in the back are very flattering best of all is the fabric it is luxurious thank you retailer for yet another,1
9016,I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black i originally got the lavender color it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it though i washed it on a regular cycle and its holding up well as you can see from the photos because of the wrap style the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt ive worn this top with regular rise jeans and havent had a problem though if you lift your arms your belly may show i purchased my usual size small,1
9017,This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash there are so many better fitting other types out there this went back,0
9018,They are really cute the fabric is a little stiff but the details are nice the waist seems big so i suggest sizing down i bought p my usual size and sent them back for a p because the waist was big,1
9019,Finally a top that fits true to size is comfortable and is the quality i expect when shopping at retailer i cannot recommend this top more if it came in other color motifs i would buy them too perfect fall transition top,1
9020,I had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on it is really flattering i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis it is really comfortable and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds i get compliments on it all the time i also like the slit a lot,1
9021,Its pretty floaty feminine the photos dont do justice to the prettiness but the photos also dont show an asymmetrical hem i understood it runs small so i got two sizes to be safe and even my larger size was strangely shortwaisted and im shortwaisted to start with maybe i couldve lived with that but both the dresses i received have an uneven hem unlike any ive ever worn or seen before its not longer on just the sides the hem is longer in one spot on the front and one in the,0
9022,This dress is lovely and the fabric is sensationalthe slits on the two sides of center front are really cool tooi am and it was way too long and i would not have it hemmed at it would remove the gorgeouslotus pattern near the base of the skirt i only wear flats at but hope this fabric appears somewhere elsesometime it is truly a gorgeous dress for a taller person,1
9023,I love this shirt the colors are just as depicted the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering fits true to size for retailer small im normally a medium outside of this store,1
9024,These are the perfect way to battle the california heat in style more beautiful than on the picture you cant see but there are gold threads running through the fabric pair with a sandal and a flow top and im good to go,1
9025,Pilcro from retailer is a great alternative to the premium denim lines with a way better price point similar cut quality with awesome rises and spandexstretch content also the styles are always on trend,1
9026,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink very washed put pinks looked awful on me as brunette maybe will work for someone who likes pastels overall style was also disappointing just hung this went back,0
9027,Dress is wonderfully made the fabric is soft and the print is beautifulwonderful detailespecially the ties nice liningnot see thru at allmid calf length looks good with heels or flatslovely dress for a sunny day or an evening out,1
9028,I am normally not a vest person however i saw this and had to try it it is awesome and on sale i am and pounds and the small fit perfectly,1
9029,I love this sweater the pale pink color is gorgeous i ordered a large because i have broad shoulders and it fits perfectly its a great sweater for any season love the slits on the sides and the longer back i would order more if it came in white or black love it,1
9030,This dress drapes very well and is flattering to many different body shapes the colors give it the flexibility to wear from summer into fall gorgeously designed,1
9031,I saw this dress in the new arrivals in red and it caught my attention but not enough to order it the pictures online for other colors didnt look that great well i saw the black in the store and decided to try it on as it looked like hte cut would be cute it fit like a glove and i actually love the pattern i ordred the peite to compare and also the red to see in person we shall see which is the winnrer,1
9032,Ive been looking for sometime for a springsummer jacket to wear on warm days over light clothing i wanted something feminine and just structured enough to move beyond casual this fits the ticket it is a very pale grey and a soft cozy fabric i am tall and lbs and usually wear an xs in many items but a s in jackets due to the shoulders these shoulders were large on me in the s the waist was also large but worth having it altered if you find this on sale its a great buy,1
9033,Gorgeous fabric love the crochet back of top cut out sides of bottoms runs small im a small top fit medium bottoms fit,1
9034,I love this poncho its perfect for chilling saturday mornings at the soccer field its a nice warm layer but doesnt get to hot pair it with a long sleeve shirt jeans and some boots and youre set,1
9035,I had high hopes for this top but once again it is just a big boxy too much material top i get the style but if it adds lbs to your middle area its not for me it is a thin material so it does hang nice,0
9036,This dress is chick but funky the material is knit but not the usual itchy knit its comfortable and cool the colors of the stripes are cool theyre earthy and go well with black brown blue and gray this is going to be a favorite for years,1
9037,I love this cotton weave shift dress it is supposed to be loose and not tight i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit ref dd lb height hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short i paired it with a few seasons ago the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses new necklace in the blue motif from retailer it has a hanging druzy pendant navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer,1
9038,This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess lol im normally a or ml and took a i think the would have worked too everything from the colors fit and flow of the dress is wonderful i didnt have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned,1
9039,I wanted to love this dress the cut fit and color are adorable unfortunately the fabric is super thin due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the antistatic spray your mom used to use in the s i was on the fence of keeping it but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your pantyline the whole world will see it i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue i am most likely going to return it even at off it is overpriced for the cheap,0
9040,I love sweaters like this its perfect over a tank top for a casual every day look its soft comfy and i love the length one more thing i like is that while it looks great just open there is a snap to fasten it if you want to,1
9041,Amazingly soft jacket tried this on and three sales girls all said they wanted it the other reviewer said there wasnt any pockets but yes there are they are sewn so you have to undo the stitching but they are there perfect jacket at a great price first time i wore it i received several compliments,1
9042,Oh my so soft so delicious i love this sweaterabsolutely my new favorite buy this you wont be disappointed the neck is soft and not irritating at all like the other reviewer saidlove lovelook how big the hood is if you so want,1
9043,I was so excited to wear this shirt even after reading the review that it curls up i decided to give this shirt a shot and i found that the same thing happened to me it also clings tightly to the body i would not recommend this shirt for anyone with broad shoulders,0
9044,I am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs her clothing is intricate boho colorful and fits like a dream when i saw this online i had to have it it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic the dress definitely has some room but it isnt quite as swingy as the catalog photo i have a lot of curves so it may be swingy on a more slender figure i ordered an xl mostly because of the s,1
9045,I didnt look at this dress twice online but when i tried it on in the store i was floored it was beautiful flattering and so much fun,1
9046,This might look good on you if you are very tall and slim i am a curvy medium and this was not at all flattering it is a straight cut and hugs in the wrong places the color is not true it is black stripes on gray not cream i thought the stripes might flatter my shape but alas i did not look good in thisthe material is very nice soft and stretchy,0
9047,I love this top and bought my usual xs i dont have any issues with the buttons gaping but am b so im not a busty girl i got the adorable umbrella print and living in a rain forest in southeast alaska it could not be cuter,1
9048,Beautiful skirt love the colors so glad i bought this runs a little big,1
9049,These pants are so comfortable and fit exactly as i expected i love the variety of fun colors i went with the gold they are cooler than jeans but just as versatile i am and the length on me is the same as the model,1
9050,I adore these pants comfortable as jammies and i wear with both sandals and booties every time i wear them i am complimented on them,1
9051,This is a surprisingly cute fauxfur coverup its much cuter in person than on the model i will be wearing mine over a little black dress for the holiday parties its very glam perfect for going out its also very soft snuggly and comfy most faux fur makes me look gigantic and wide but this one looks a bit like a little capelet or shrug and very flattering it flares out nicely in the back too and it has a pretty laceknit stripe pattern on the back it does shed a bit though also,1
9052,I have had this dress for a few months now and find it is super comfortable for the hot weather and can go dressy or casual with the right accessories it does run large in xxs the xxs petite fit a little better by was way too short for me even better is that you can wash on the super gentle cycle and lay flat to dry yes it says dry clean only but its is made of cupro and you should be able to wash that material i have washed mine several times and it has never shrunk or lost shape the she,1
9053,Ive purchased pilcro jeans in the past and theyve held up great unfortunately the material used for this particular jean is a far far cry from what it used to be the thighs of these jeans start pilling yes pilling after just a few wears ive never had jeans do this whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disasterdont buy these you will be very disappointed,0
9054,Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a rehearsal dinner and i couldnt believe how beautifully it fit fitted through the top falling to a gorgeous flare hit her at knee shes classic elegant femme fatale look that will work for a range of occasions,1
9055,I bought this tee in most of the colors available thats how much i liked it its not tissue thin its a good medium weight it doest hug the body too closely i am and lbs with a little post partum belly and this is a really flattering tee in m,1
9056,Great style and quality however sizing runs smaller than anticipatedi gave it as a gift to a friend who wears a smaller size than me,1
9057,While being stylish the dress is well made and comfortable,1
9058,This kimono is beautiful pictures definitely do not do it justice i love the details of the beading and sequins throughout the only downfall is that they can snag and get fall off quite easily delicate but still my fav kimono ever,1
9059,This shirt runs very large i will be returning for a smaller size,0
9060,I was nervous about this purchase but it turned out to be a new favorite the blue color is stunning on and i can easily see this taking me from work to dinner i am normally a size or in dresses after reading reviews about how this dress runs large i ordered a and hoped i didnt have to return it the is perfect and roomy the drawstring can be let out or in for more figure definition this really is a beautiful and modest dress,1
9061,I bought this in black last year and i love it i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops arent really my style and these prints wouldnt be so easy to mix and match please offer in other solid colors i would buy all of them this skirt is really that fabulous not only does it fit well and run true to size it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on and gives a little more tummy coverage but not too much somehow it hits me a,1
9062,Im just ordering my rd pair i first got the greyjust about live in them super comfy and flattering then i got the off white and now i ordered the green which i cannot wait to get great pant,1
9063,I love this top in peach i usually wear a size and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store it fits well but loose i usually front tuck it in what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders very effortless but doesnt feel like it is falling off a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders due to elastic in the shoulder this top h,1
9064,Completely in love with this dress im a huge fan of byron lars and this one by far is my favorite everything about this dress is perfect its very well made too i usually wear a size but kept the size instead the waist felt a bit too tight with the btw the belt is adjustable,1
9065,Love the simple nonfussy style of this dress note that the color is not ivory as described and expected not the first time retailer makes that mistake however i still found the oatmealishwarm beige color to be flattering to my skin tone warm tones look best on me like that the shoulders are covered while still feeling sleeveless gives it a dressier feel the fine texture is lovely this does drape up top while the bottom clings a bit but not overly much for me to feel immodest i am,1
9066,These pants are great the color is beautiful the fabric super soft fit is slimmer than expected but sill nice,1
9067,Wanted to love this dress bit it wasnt to be strange fit and doesnt drape nicely as in the photo also the blue color was much darker in person wouldnt recommend,0
9068,Its hard purchasing clothes online i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect,1
9069,I love this dress based on reviews i ordered the small and the only problem i had was that while the dress is quite large the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted which i didnt find comfortable so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own and the results are great the fiber content contains a bit of wool but i do not find it scratchy to my skin and i am lovin the hilo aspects of the hem fun dress for winter,1
9070,I had four weddings this fall and tried this dress on but ended up not purchasing because i already had dresses to wear but i told myself i would purchase the dress if it ever went on sale i dont have an occasion to wear it yet but i cant wait the dress is so lovely and the details are beautiful the only thing im worried about is the possibility for some of the embroidered parts to pill it looks very flattering and hugs all my curves beautifully,1
9071,I love the design and fit and quality have been looking for a longline top like this and was willing to pay full price i have that dreadful little roll right under my bust line and this sucks everything in nicely smooths it all out im a c and everything was contained nicely and fit great in the large top heres my issue wore it once and the colors ran i was so excited to wear this i didnt even wash the top i rinsed and dried the bottom though and im not a swimmer just let,0
9072,I discovered this top folded on a shelf and loved the material and this brand so i decided to try it on even though its super hot right now in ar im so glad i did and ended up finding the other color and buying both i am b and long waisted it is difficult to tell in the pictures how this top fits around the waist it is snug fitting but the material is thicker so i feel like its very flattering i tried it on as a boat neck look then saw online it was off the shoulder a,1
9073,These super cute leggings are comfortable and functional with a fun design,1
9074,Im lbs and tried this on a small at my store and then ordered it in a small petite i like the petite better even though there isnt much of a difference the petite is about inches long it still covers the bum but i was hoping to wear it with shorts and i think its too long for that i love the beautiful coral color received a compliment on the color the first time i wore it the quality is superb the only downside is i dont like the way it looks when zipped it doesnt give mu,1
9075,This shirt is beautiful it is flowy and light a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring however do not follow the washing instructions on the tag it says you can machine wash tumble dry low and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again if you do order please take the,0
9076,I have several maeve dresses that fit really well this was not the case with this dress fabric and color are great fit was off especially in top worst part was zipper that wouldnt move smoothly took me a good minutes to get it unzipped such a bummer,0
9077,Order yourself a pair today my new favorite jean especially for springsummer good color and very comfortable,1
9078,I cant wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering as another interviewer commented it can also be worn as a dress well worth the investment,1
9079,This bra is everything looks good and feels good so happy with this purchase for reference i am a c cup and got a medium i do have a little side boob action happening but im still happy with the fit of the medium,1
9080,This dress is absolutely beautiful i wore it in my engagement photos and it is so flowy and so beachy you can dress it up or down and its very comfortable as well unfortunately it got ocean water on it in my photos so i took it to the dry cleaners and they lost it hopefully it will come back in stock and i can buy it again it is easily my favorite dress i have owned in quite some time for tall people it may be too short to wear with anything but flats im and wore sandals and,1
9081,This is such a gorgeous tee with beautiful embroidery the colors are exactly as shown and while i take petite sizes at i like the length of the regular for myself im pounds and tried the xxs but found it to be too fitted and went with the xs in the end i do feel that it fits tts and that is just a personal preference,1
9082,Ive been searching for a velvet top or dress for awhile this arrived yesterday and its absolutely beautiful the color is rich and the fabric is thick and feels and looks like a very expensive high quality item i got it with the off promo but its worth every penny of the full price cant wait to wear for the holidays get this dress,1
9083,The previous review by beardedlady said it best yes i do still feel like a little girl playing dress up in it but i dont care this is a fun creative dress to be worn on the days when you feel like having a julie andrews moment in my own opinion i dont think i can wear this without a topper covering the poufy shoulders so im happy that i own the dara moto jacket in plum to toughen up the look i am c and the bodice feels a little loose all over with the size re,1
9084,So this top is kind of short but that is pictured it hits right where it does in the photo which i like it is a sheer material not terribly so but you will most likely need a cami which you could pair a long one with to offset the shorter top if you dont like the shortness i love the top its very pretty detailing cute just as pictured i ordered a size and it fits great i usually wear petites but you really dont need to get a petite because its short as it is i have broad sho,1
9085,The ruching on this suit is super flattering i ordered the medium i am lbs and usually a solid medium in most retailer items though i would definitely recommend sizing up with this guy i was able to get it on and it certainly held everything in place but since it is a one piece pulling it on was a bit of a struggle and i certainly could have used about an inch more fabric from top to bottom i will be returning and exchanging for a large,1
9086,This shirt is not a good look for a gal with hips the fit at the top is tight i ordered a small but there is so much material at the bottom and if you are a little taller i am it hits at a place that is not flattering i was hoping for something that hung straight down and would be good with leggings this is not italso the material is a little stiffer then i was expecting,0
9087,This skirt caught my eye immediately i love the beautiful patterns and colors im currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top which works well the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy i still love it and definitely recommend this standout piece,1
9088,It fits great i love the material and how it fits and drapes,1
9089,I cant stop rubbing the faux fur faux fur can be cheap and tacky but this looks and feels beautiful it has two hook and eyes and comes with a third which i used to add another hook on top above my bust its roomy so size down if you want it fitted im and with a c bust and a short torso and i got a small i could have worn the xs but i like the fact that the small allows for a good weight cashmere sweater underneath without feeling tight the hood is the best part its so drama,1
9090,Great dress the seaming helps add shape to the dress it is flattering and super comfortable this dress is so easy to wear im sure i will reach for it again and again,1
9091,I tried this top on in the store today and had to have it i love the laces up the sides and the zipper in back it is short i found a really cute pair of baggy pants with a black pattern to pair with itin retailer shirts i wear an xs or s or a or i got this in a and it fit perfectly,1
9092,I totally agree with the last reviewer im pounds with somewhat wide shoulders the xsmall fit my torso but was so tight in my shoulders i couldnt move my arms the small was better but was too big in the torso the material itself was really nice too bad the fit was so awkward and unflattering,0
9093,The material of this swimsuit is amazing the swimsuit is expensive but it is high quality in person definitely one id recommend buying,1
9094,Woah these jeans looked ridiculous on me i felt as though it was and i was raiding my moms closet the combination of the light wash the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no it really accentuates any pouch you may have i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering i am curvy no no no,0
9095,This sweater is gorgeousit is of great quality and very warm i was very excited and wanted it to look great howeveri have a large bust and am full figuredso it was not appealing and just kind of hung there i feel that it would look great on thinner womenand it is a gorgeous sweaterjust not for me,1
9096,I cant wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top the style is so flattering it doesnt bag out to make you look pregnant the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch soft fabric drapes beautifully the armholes are not oversized the fabric is opaque so no camisole requiredi am and lbs and a i purchased size small,1
9097,I purchased the pale green in this sweater first loved it so much i purchased in another color,1
9098,Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullnessnot like represented picture and it snags very easily i have a mo old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places im going to see about returning it with the snags,0
9099,I ordered the coral size small its a beautiful peach color and the linen is very soft it is longer and roomier in the waist than i was expecting however with skinny jeans it looks great the detail makes this top very eyecatching im very happy with my purchase,1
9100,The blue looks a lot more grey in person and ive gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties the textureprint is really unique im pounds and a small fits perfect highly recommend,1
9101,The material is so soft and lightweight without being sheer i am and ordered a size in blue they have a relaxed fit and a polishedcasual look,1
9102,This top is amazing so soft and the off the shoulder part stays where it belongs im usually a large but got this in a med fits perfectly,1
9103,This dress fits perfect the material is so soft and hangs so flattering long enough to cover the booty but short enough to show off my legs and the color is beautiful i got the wine color,1
9104,I wish we had cooler weather in california so i could wear this more often i bought this sweatercoat on sale plus an extra off so i got a great deal on it i love this sweater it looks matronly in the picture but it looks very chic and sophisticated in person the sleeves hit above the wrist as shown on the model it does have pockets its the right weight for chilly weather,1
9105,I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it i am usually a msize but as this tee is fairly sheer i did better exchanging for a large the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable a must have for yogis,1
9106,I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine i find the cut very flattering and slimming and love the pockets it works great for northern california winters with tights boots boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors and on its own indoors i wish there was a longsleeved version i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it good job sparrow btw i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress the mockneck dress and this one is just an inc,1
9107,I really love this sweater beautiful color and nice texture i cant wait to wear it,1
9108,Some of the reviews about this being cheap fabric made me nervous about purchasingbut i did and i love it the material isnt super thick but i like that as i tend to run hot its super soft material and feels good on,1
9109,This a great skirt for someone with a straight or boyish figure this skirt does not accommodate a curvy figure small waist feminine hips,0
9110,Luv this topdresscoverupruns a lil bigi sized down for a more fitted look to pair it with cropped skinny jeans fabric is nice comfortable and light,1
9111,This has quickly become my favorite sweater i am thinking of getting another one in case mine wears out its comfycozy and soft love it layered over tshirts or long sleeved collared shirts and am looking forward to trying it with a dress and bare legs once its warmer out it runs kind of big im and usually a size and i got an xs the s fit too,1
9112,I love this top the quality is topnotch and its true to size its not skintight but its also not so roomy that you look pregnant one thing that surprised me is that its a silk material i thought it was linen or something like that but i love it,1
9113,Dark burgundy sweater cable pattern in front subtle hard to see online embedded with panels of brown tweed in peplum section beautiful fall sweater soft and comfortable looks great with skinny jeans would also look nice with a casual skirt or pants beautiful color slightly roomy fit not fitted but not boxytrue to general size love this for fall and winter flattering comfortable unique,1
9114,I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look not going for romantic smoky eye skinny dark jeans under it and pumps swings further from body than i thoughtim wear a b and am typically a size thats the size i bought fits well and while pretty its made with heft not overly delicate cant see this snagging its more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans detail at the neck gives it more interest,1
9115,Im a huge maeve enthusiast tried this on in three different colors and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season this top is more truetosize than others have been more recently the petite size for me was too short to tuck in but the regular worked perfectly the top is roomy flowy and the white version is sheer but a white tank under it would be perfect the green umbrellas are adorable a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring,1
9116,This blouse is so beautiful the collar sleeves materialeverything except the cut it was like a tent it needed to be more tapered which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow and be about two inches longeri had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed please fix it and then i will buy again i am lbs and bustya small was perfect with the exception of the massive amount of material,0
9117,The cut of this dress is designed for any figure the back hem sweeps as you walk and the pleats prevent the material clinging to places you want to downplay such as bulges even flat chested women can look curvy and lovely in this dress only downside if any is the lavender coloring which doesnt do much for impact if you are pale skinned and fair im blonde and while i got lots of compliments on the becoming flow of the dress even i can see it doesnt say wow because i kind of fade away,1
9118,It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online the color cut and delicate details are perfectly balanced with a moderately sexy neckline ladylike with a little attitude the fabric is gorgeous and is a stunning shade of midnight blue this dress is perfect for a summer beach party or to attend a wedding cut is extremely flattering and the halter tie top allows for adjustment for a perfect fit i just received it today and it is a must have for any closet tried it on with a be,1
9119,Contrary to the first review there is a zipper so while it wasnt easy to get on it did fit over my bust i found this too small and high waisted and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l,0
9120,I absolutely love the way this skirt looks and fits i have a smaller waist and larger hips so it is hard to find a pencil skirt that fits but this skirt fits great the material has some stretch to it but is still thick and looks really nice the colors are beautiful i bought it in the red which is really just multicolored i want it in the green now too,1
9121,I love this tshirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a tits soft pretty and covers my wide bottom well,0
9122,I am a curvy girl and bought these jeans in a size i dont have stick legs and the jeans have worn right through were my thighs rub together with the old pilcro material this did not happen this is a super soft jean and although the fit was good they just didnt last,0
9123,I saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down is perfect one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own was worried the waistband would be unflattering since im short and curvy but its very flattering can dress up or wear to the beach i love it,1
9124,Fantastic price right now and very flattering cute and sexy dress that hugs but its forgiving,1
9125,I tried this on instore it is super cute i am waiting for it to go on sale because i wasnt sure it was completely worth the price if you are inbetween sizes take the larger size,1
9126,I ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color looks great with my blonde hair the bell sleeves which are all the rage right now add to the feminine look i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look,1
9127,I absolutely love this top it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style short waist nice soft colors i ordered another top that is this style perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments,1
9128,I am months post baby and still have some body selfconfidence issues i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive this swimsuit does the trick makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat love this suit,1
9129,Great casual top with flare looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans flattering with peplum in back nice cut for shoulders and neckline,1
9130,This skirt is gianormous i usually take an xl or l so i ordered both the waistband on the xl was so huge i didnt even try it on i feared it would not stay up so i tried the large and it was big as well i think i would have needed a medium but as it is it is not the cute aline that appears in the picture i wonder how they even got it to look like that it is huge hipy and bunchy yuck,0
9131,These are such underrated pants i love the fit style fabric everything about them they are the perfect weight can be worn with boots sandals flats etc they run tts i got my usual get yourself a pair while they last you wont regret it,1
9132,This is a full swing top because the top is so full it should hit at or slightly above the waist and it does on me so that a pant or skirt waistline can be seen and balance out the proportions will look great with a pencil skirt or any pant that as a mid or high rise fitted waist and flat front no pleats or draw string for example the fabric has weight and hangs nicely color is true to photos easy way to look a little dressier during summer lb b small regular fit me perfe,1
9133,These bottoms are super comfortable i think they run a little big for a small i bought another swimsuit from retailer and the bottoms are also small and fit a little better than these it goes well with the peplum swimsuit top im so excited about wearing them this season,1
9134,This dress is super soft beautiful on perfect fit,1
9135,I love this sweater i bought it on sale in maroon and it is the most comfortable sweater ever i like to wear it with leggings it has a nice oversize fit and is perfect for fat days or any day,1
9136,These jeans are very comfortable with the higher waist they have a slight stretch and keep their shape i also like that the inside is a darker color which looks good when rolled up,1
9137,Like the other reviewer i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores i tried both the medium and the small usually at retailer i wear a medium however this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers making my bottom look bumpy when i tried on the small the dress fit and flattered me perfectly by far the best dress i ever owned i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing fo,1
9138,This sweater is so cute i intend to wear it as much as possible the little elbow patches are a cute detail its warm but classy,1
9139,This dress hangs horribly unlike the photo the waist does not cinch too bad the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice because i bought it on sale i may try to tailor it to work but unless you are willing to do that its a no go,0
9140,Love this top perfect for fallwinter it does run large but it looks great love,1
9141,I am wearing a bodysuit and long skirt from bhldn for my wedding and i bought this skirt to change in to for my reception it is perfectly elegant yet simple i cannot wait to wear it on my big day it can be dressed up or down so easily love it,1
9142,I tried this on instore in white and in grey it is so super comfy and really cute i love the wide straps i ended up getting it in white and black the grey looked a tad bit more casual than the white and black tanks,1
9143,When this dress first came out i thought it was weird then i started seeing people on instagram wearing outfits that look super cute and i wanted it but sold out so when this version came out i snatched it up right away its different from anything else i own very quirky and in style details and has a bit of a man repeller vibe that is why i love it,1
9144,Got this today and highly recommend it it fits perfectly and is very flattering i can see wearing this all wear round perfect date shirt,1
9145,I love this simple but stylish t shirt the fabric is soft and it fits true to size and i knew i would love it even before it was delivered i recommend it,1
9146,Super flattering my mom and i both bought this and we have very different body types we both had to size up a bit as i have a large chest and she has a large ribcage i got a size im normally a size and she got a it was much easier to zip up without bras on and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra my mom is pretty short so shes going to get her straps shortened for reference im about hope this helps,1
9147,The dress is extremely high quality i purchased the dress in black the white collared shirt that the model is wearing under the dress is not part of the dress the dress overall is like a balloon unless youre extremely tall and skinny this dress makes you look bigger i ordered the small petite and am lbs and i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately its going back the petite hits inches above the knee for reference,0
9148,I loved it but can understand the mixed reviews i am and a size usually d you need to be on the tall side for it to work definitely will not work if you are petite i can also see if you have a fuller chest how it would tent and look like a maternity top i have that happen with off the shoulder styles that said if it works it is great i didnt size down went with s because the xs didnt hang well it was too short at the shoulders and neckline again probably need to be in,1
9149,This blouse is stunning its ultra feminine but has a bit of bohemian feel to it i am and pounds i ordered an xs at first in both colors but they were a little big in the bust area and under the arms my bust size is c i ordered the xxs in both sizes not petite as i have a longer torso and they fit perfectly they are not too snug anywhere and it makes the blouse look even better obviously because it fits better the hem of the shirt in a size xxs hits right below the hip b,1
9150,It just didnt work for me i dont know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs but this dress was a strike out the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts for reference i am and lbs with measurements and i purchased a medium the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy overall very good quality and beautiful,0
9151,This dress is amazing ordered one with a discount the dark blue with flowers print and it was becoming my goto for work so had to bite the bullet and order two other colors full price size m fit perfect,1
9152,Really cute skirt found it to be too much material on my frame would look really great on someone taller the tie in the front was pretty but a bit bulky on me and ultimately i want a skirt i can wear both ways with shirts tucked in or out this one is tuck in only so sending back will look really great on someone else though nice knee length skirt,1
9153,Birthday gift from my husband and i have it hanging up where i can see it the design is like a huge beautiful tapestry although it looks heavy the cotton has a nice feel to it handembroidered here and there i usually wear size sm and the med is very comfortable gorgeous,1
9154,This is my new favorite sweater it is lightweight and drapey very flattering can be dressy or casual,1
9155,Really well made beautiful sadly it is very short not a tunic at all,0
9156,Beautiful and soft and so well made cropped cardigan by the in house retailer branding the color is more muted in person but will work with many different skirts and pants including jeans i have many ideas for this lovely cardigan the size medium for my dd chest lbs and inches is perfect and the sleeves bellow out a bit which gives this cardigan a nice sharp look i agree with the other reviewer more colors and more of type of quality and character please for seasons ahead lo,1
9157,This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed i bought the white i always buy white it seems but loved it so much i came back for the blue get this and live effortlessly this summer,1
9158,Beautiful material great design get a bigger size,1
9159,I really love this top great colors comfortable long enough always a problem for me light but feels quality fabric and nice details,1
9160,What a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket the swing styling on this jacket is so cutenot too full you still get a nice silhouette from the front with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple it will be a goto piece in my closet the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful as other reviewers have commented it does run large i am exchanging it for a size down i cant wait to get it in and wear it,1
9161,Im always weary of v necks but this shirt is great the fit is true to size and while it is a v neck its not such a deep plunge that you need a cami underneath great material too and perfect for dressing up a bit i bought the blue color and love it,1
9162,I have a love affair with pilcro and these jeans make my heart throb ive been stalking these jeans online and tried them on in the store yesterday im curvy and was concerned that they would make my legs look like tree trunks swathed in denim with miniature cartoon feet protruding from below the hem not so they fit like a glove rested perfectly at my lower calf hugged around the hips and waist and flared without looking like church bells seriously if youre a cropped pants fan,1
9163,Simply awesome wonderful fit and flatters any body type looks great booties flats or flip flops must have,1
9164,I have purchased several pairs of these pants and love them i got two pairs last fall one in purple and one in red i purchased a pair in sand this spring and just purchased pairs in the violet and taupe last week i purchased the violet to replace the purple pair i bought last year stained them then first time i wore them these pants are great but the violet color doesnt quite match the color in the picture which looks very similar to the pair i bought last year in person the violet,1
9165,These leggings are a quality product at a great price i ordered these for my daughter and she loves them warm and comfy she wears them all the time,1
9166,I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter great buy,1
9167,I love this duster i got my usual size and it fits exactly as pictured the color of the fabric is a perfect neutral and will look good with anything the knit is open and fairly seethrough this avoids the bathrobe look that a long length sweater can have bought at full price and im not sorry because i bet it will be gone before long,1
9168,I ordered my usual size from retailer and it fit perfect for reference i am and pounds unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest i really like this dress i think its beautifully made is it my favorite dress ive purchased from retailer no but still a nice dress,1
9169,This sweater is buttery soft and warm it is long and you will want every color i bought the sky blue and it looks fabulous with so many outfits i had to get the gray color also the sleeves are a soft fitted rib material and the body is long and roomy love love,1
9170,This blouse combines two things i love swing tops and bows just received this and am very pleased the blue version is very pretty i recently purchased another top by the same brand and ordered a for this i ordered a small and am glad i did i would suggest ordering your regular size the top is fitted the bottom is very fluid,1
9171,I bought the white in a m one size down from my normal i could have gone with a s given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen it is very light and comfortable the length is a tunic on me at so keep that in mind if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two if they get black or grey i will def buy another one,1
9172,The fit on this skirt is flawless i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me the buttons are so adorable and the color orange is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer will wear this a lot,1
9173,Get creative with the neckline or let it fall where ever this is a purposefully slouchy uber casual super soft,1
9174,Cloth and stone never lets me down awesome quality comfort and versatility i imagine myself living in this dress this summer soft fabric easy breezy fit pockets machine washablewhats not to love go buy it,1
9175,Im glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one i bought this in a medium usually wear a and it fit perfectly the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeanspantsshorts the lace detail is just gorgeous the bottom flows more loosely but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans,1
9176,Lovely dress comfortable fabric and great cut the combination of the alignment of stripes works beautifully and is very figure flatteringversatile to keep casual or dress up with a great pair of shoes,1
9177,This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag i am b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline love it,1
9178,I agree a few others it may be a little bit boxy but i dont even care because its so beautiful definitely a top im going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade,1
9179,This runs super big and it just wasnt flatteringway too much fabric i wanted to love this dress,0
9180,This dress is so cozy and soft love it the cowl is big in a flattering way absolutely adore the buttons that run down the back of the dress such an unexpected detail which makes retailer pieces so special i would layer tights and tank underneath anyway so the see through aspect other reviewers mentioned wasnt apparent to me and also wasnt as big a deal,1
9181,This tank is not very flattering there is a lot of fabric its very boxy the holes kind of remind me of a high school basketball jersey i even sized down and its still just wide im returning,0
9182,I saw this in the store and decided to try it on it is so pretty the fit is perfect i didnt think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front when i put it on i didnt mind them at all it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors dry clean only is the only drawback to this one,1
9183,Such a pretty fall sweater nice fit wore it once out shopping and it snagged had to return sadly,0
9184,I am and pounds and wear a p i ordered the size with the willingness to hem them my goal was to get this true highwasted style which is extremely flattering when the pants arrived i was first struck by their high quality fabric and the top notch tailoring the fabric is substantial yet it drapes beautifully the true high waist flatters but the buttons and slant pocket details further whittle the waist i am so happy with my purchase,1
9185,I was debating getting a large in this top but went for the medium boy is it huge the jersey fabric is quite thick which makes the sleeves bulky and uncomfortable even the small would be giant for reference i normally wear a size my chest is e and this was just so so huge it hung so badly of my chest that it looked frumpy and made me look bigger than i amthe colours are true and nice and vibrant definitely size down with this one,0
9186,This skirt is perfectit can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it it is a thick fabric so it keeps you warm being a freeze baby i really like that while the fabric is thick it is soft and it is moveable rather than being super stuff it is not at all itchy it is a little longer than i would prefer in a pencil skirt but i ended up keeping it anyway this was somewhat compounded with the fact that i did end up sizing up on this dress my normal size tending to stay at my,1
9187,This sweater is the best sweater to throw on over a buttoned blouse tshirts long sleeves tanks i always get comments on how comfortable and adorable this sweater is a worthwhile buy,1
9188,Unbelievably soft fabric that doesnt feel like it will pill i ordered dark grey im just after baby and size m fits well superflattering doesnt smash my buns the seams are in all the right places to flatter styling is between ballerina and badass as i think the ankle wraps look a little tough i highly recommend,1
9189,I usually get a large in tops that dont come in tall due to my long torso thanks to the reviews on this one i got the white top in a medium the medium fit perfectly it looked just like it does on the model and not like a maternity top at all the material is thick enough that the white wasnt see through i paired it with some crop skinny pants and a statement necklace and received many compliments on it the top is a little bland and needs some kind of jewelry to really make it oth,1
9190,I have quite a few of these tiny henleys because they are unique and comfortable the color and details of this one are beautiful if you are a fan of these too you wont be disappointed with this one,1
9191,This coat is very soft and flattering in design good quality and very comfortable i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well if anything it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath go up a size,1
9192,I tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section couldnt stop thinking about the dress though so checked reviews online from homemany said to size up i ordered a medium and it is perfect fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good,1
9193,I am tall lbs i bought the in the honey color they fit perfectly there is some stretch and they are super soft which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes the length is good since they are capris also they did not have my size in store so they had them shipped for free to my home received them within business daysi would very much recommend them for a casual fun look the honey color will look great with navy grey and white for summer,1
9194,I love this sweater i ordered the xs petite it fits perfectly it is soft i hate itchy sweaters the peach color is actually more pink but i love the color great buy im ordering another one,1
9195,Strapless dresses can be so flattering so when i saw this on retailer i had to order it this dress did not disappoint for reference i ordered a size and i am lbs b chest in the chest area it fits perfectly while the ribcage area is a little snug but not uncomfortably so the pockets are great the denim quality is great and i like the frayed bottom of dress i got compliments straight away on the beauty of the dress from two men which i thought was quite interesting because i,1
9196,Great that its hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets,1
9197,I have always liked this look so ordered my usual size s fit is good looks pretty much on me as in the pic even the arm length works not too long i dont care for the placement of the top buttons which are just cosmetic they dangle downwards showing more of the loop than the button itself placement is not directly over the bottom buttons which puts it in the lower breast area mmmmm not the look i want looks unattractive if i keep this i will have to move the buttons more in lin,1
9198,I love this top but make sure to size down i am usually a small in blouses and the size s was like a tent returned for an xs overall the fabric is a great quality and the colors are stunning the orange isnt too harsh a keeper for sure,1
9199,This dress fits beautifully the fabric is thick enough to feel significant and not flimsy but the dress doesnt feel heavy at all the detail is gorgeous but still subtle its a little too nice for me to wear to work but the perfect special occasion or party dress,1
9200,I originally got this for myself but it was just a little bit more snug than i liked i ended up giving it to my daughter it fits her nicely and she wore it to her holiday party at work and it was a hit,1
9201,I love this top i have all colors in size large im lbs with a large bust its a loose fit that is very flattering do not dry i wash in cold water and hang dry first one i bought i dried and it shrunk quick a bit if you are tall size up,1
9202,The best shirt to throw on with a pair of shorts and its effortlessly adorable,1
9203,I wanted to love this kimonoit is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabricnot a soft touch and because it runs small i bought the ml and usually wear a but i couldnt bring the kimono together in the front for a belting option,0
9204,Love the muted pattern in the blue and spots of gray front and back i wore this with my gray leggingpants the pleats allow for a relaxed fit very comfortable over all,1
9205,Really love this blouse for several reasonsit fits pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it not too much of a difference between a or it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it now my favorite part is the tie in the middlefinally not a boxy waist its up to you to pull it in or loosen the length is perfectnot too long so it works over skirts too it is soft my only concern is how long will it last will require careful washing and ironing may end up pu,1
9206,Wore this dress recently on a work trip traveled very well cut and fabric are super flattering,1
9207,I am a huge fan of ag stevie ankles and own at least a dozen pair i am so this style is perfect for me this particular wash is a fantastic and flattering fit it hits right above my ankle and fits beautifully through the hips and legs i am going to buy a nd pair as i know i will be wearing these all the time,1
9208,I absolutely love these shorts i wear a in all pilcro and these are no exception i would not have grabbed these to try on but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me first they are definitely short when rolled twice and i do not have skinny legs in fact i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them for some reason these shorts make my legs look great i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer but i still like them at home,1
9209,Loved the flared style of this cardigan i first choose the yellow and returned it for the navy the knit pointelle design is interesting and the cardi is so soft have used it many times already always makes me feel great,1
9210,Beautifully embroidered dress its loose fitting not meant to be tailor fitted so it would run large to you if thats what you were expecting the colors are gorgeous and the skirt has a really beautiful flow if you are hoping for a fitted look size down one size there is plenty of stretch to this dress and plenty of room in the bust and waist i generally go between p and p and got this in a p though either would work it comes to just above my knees at,1
9211,Looks like a pregnancy top a lot gathers in front and back added pounds to me not flattering on much longer than on the model and the color is not white its white with a weird tan taupe stripei returned it same day i received it which was disappointing,0
9212,I love this dresss gentle blue lace the silhouette is just as seen in the pictures i found the dress tight in the chest and had to size up one size to,1
9213,The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious order one size up this line runs small i read the reviews and ordered a medium i am normally xss in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out trust me youll want another pair after trying these on,1
9214,Its a cute topper it fits nicely through the shoulders and arms and because of the aline through the bottom but the chest is sizes too small and i dont have a big chest the fabric is very scratchy and mine arrived unbuttoned and unzipped and i suspect it had been worngoing back not tracy reeses best piece,0

9216,I love this shirt it is soft romantic and flowy i love the material it is probably one of the softest things i own great quality and lightweight,1
9217,I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale definitely worth the wait the quality and designs are superb true to size,1
9218,This cute top is made in the usa yay it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric the black and white was cute but hung strangely and felt stiff i am size smmed c and went with the small cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm,1
9219,This is the ideal easybreezy sweater to throw over leggings when you just feel like being comfy cozy but still stylish i love it,1
9220,Got this in the sky color returned it because the top is way too sheer for me if you know what i mean i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids no can do also for the price material just felt flimsy cheap it does run small the medium was good on me and im b,0
9221,Ive been looking for a black offtheshoulder dress and found this baby in store today for reference i am b and took a small this dress is a shiftswing style so if youre looking for something fitted this isnt your dress as another reviewer mentioned ladies who are busty may not like this as the ruffle at the top could add unwanted volume if you are extremely thin or petite i might size down but i like my clothing loose vs fitted so i kept the small the fabric is g,1
9222,I ordered the moss green color i love it the color is really cool the length is longer and the fabric is soft great summer option,1
9223,I was so excited to try these on at my local retailer im so glad i did before i ordered them online because i found the fit to be totally off the pants bulged around my hips and looked very awkward they were also not as soft as i expected them to be,0
9224,A fun dress to just throw on go nice details in the bodice mix of blues in the prints little longer in back is nice detail for those of us who want a shorter dress but not the worry of flashing from behind,1

9227,This dress is so comfortable and looks so good i love the low back and the swing in the skirt i ordered the tangerine which is really more red than orange this is a simple slipon dress perfect for traveling as it doesnt wrinkle i will wear this often when the warm weather arrives,1
9228,This skirt is gorgeous drapes beautifully the color is vibrant get it youll be so pleased i sure am,1
9229,The photo does not do this dress justice at all its a light lavender and extremely flattering im athletic so have broader shoulders and hips and this is an amazing fit for me also the front has a small button to make it more modest which is closed in the photo of the model but if you leave it open vavavavoom so to summarize beautiful spring lavender fabulously feminine fit get it,1
9230,Maybe i didnt read the description correctly but i was surprised that this skirt has two front slits thighlevel rather than just one as shown in the photo above its gorgeous silk the patterns are vivid and the pleats are classy giving just the right balance of form and flow however when i sat down very little coverage which means i wouldnt wear it much i considered taking it to my tailor but too much effort and however its beautifully crafted if youre looking for som,1
9231,I love this top i ordered it in a large thinking it would be a tight rib but it is not so i reordered it in a small i am lbs g chest the small fits perfectly and probably could have taken an xs it is stretchy but fits wonderfully i bought the black i love how the neck snaps and adds a little pizzazz to a simple black turtle neck im wearing it today with straight leg jeans and my leopard print ballet flats i feel like audrey hepburn i will not be dry cleaning it i will wash,1
9232,I spotted this pj pants in the store tried it on and love it the material is very soft and comfortable the fabric is on the thin side thus one star off the quality the patterncolor varies the one i got has more pinkish flowers i am lbs and size s fits nice i could probably go down to a size xs but i like my pj pants to fit a bit roomy therefore size s fits better the length is more like ankle length on me since i am petite it is very cute on and perfect for a chill summe,1
9233,I didnt notice this dress online but it jumped out at me at the store i sized down to a small as the bust and arm area seemed very loose in medium b its very comfy and beautiful i tried it with a belt but quite honestly it doesnt need one and it looks so much nicer without one not sure about what bra to wear likely strapless or as one person said none,1
9234,I have loved ag stevie ankle denim for awhile now and have never been disappointed with the fit or quality this pair is no exception to that i am and about slender with athletic thighs and the fit great buying them online i wasnt able to check how distressed the denim was the pair i received in the mail was indeed slightly different in the distressed locations from the online image mine had no distressing on the upper thigh and one medium and one small spot on each leg onl,1
9235,This dress is gorgeous well made lined and tts i get compliments each time i wear it and find it unique yet classy and appropriate for work unlike some of the maeve tops i have purchased this year it does not run big and if you are banking on a little stretch i would order the next size up you wont be disappointed,1
9236,I fell in love with this dress two years after it sold out so im so lucky to have gotten my greedy little hands on this eye catching retro modern number my mom adores the fit on me as it reminds her of her youth in the s and s i originally sized down to a not realizing my bustwide rib cage would make the fit difficult wish i could have found an but settled for p and will have a tailor finish it im also going to remove the tulle layer since i want to wear as more casual frock,1
9237,I didnt go with the intention of even looking at a dress but decided to try this on once i did i knew that i had to get it its so cute i got the one listed as green motif which is actually a royal blue bodice the colors are vibrant and its so comfortable,1
9238,I love this shirt it is very soft and the lace on the sleeves adds an extra element i liked this shirt so much that i ordered a second one,1
9239,I saw this on line this morning and was hesitant to order one size smaller so decided to visit local anthopology store with fingers crossed they would have it in a size im and a size usually in retailer clothing not only was the size perfect the fabric and quality are excellent nice flowy pant legs and the top has a one button adjustment on the shoulder if you dont want it too low either way worked for myself dress up or down this is a must,1
9240,This dress is so flattering and just beautiful in person love it,1
9241,This top us flowy breathable and feminine the fabric is light so it doesnt feel like youre wearing a swing dress with heavy fabric it is sheer so a cami underneath is best with flowers less structured tops i size down to a small or some other tops id go to medium or,1
9242,Love this dress very flattering material is thinner and more lightweight than i was imaging but it is great it really does run small like the other reviewers said glad i ordered one size up fits perfectly,1
9243,I tried this on in the store because i have had my eye on it for a while and i want to be sure i get the correct size as other reviewers have said it does run large i normally wear a s and the xs was big on me i could go with the xxs but of course it appears to be sold out now the lighter colors look like they would be slightly sheer but the navy blue and red are not i thought the material was good quality not sure if it would shrink top is rather long on the back but the picture does,1
9244,I like flowy tops because i have a bit of a belly and i like to camouflage it but this top was really flowy the fabric is great and the embroidery is beautiful i was hoping for this to be a holiday staple this year it has to go back though just too large i dont love it quite enough to order a size down,0
9245,Love love this top its flattering shows off your shoulders soft and has delicate embroidery i typically order a xxsp in antro tops as im very petite but decided to order both xxsp and xxs just to see the difference the xxs worked better as the xxsp was too short in length and kind of looked like i was trying to fit into a child size top the xxs is a perfect length its my new favorite and i can see keeping this in my wardrobe for a long long time,1
9246,When i wore this dress i got tons of compliments the quality is great along with the style,1
9247,I was really hoping this dress would work because it looks adorable on the model i ordered my usual size but when i put it on the cross part in the front was way too high on my neck and was super uncomfortable i also had a lot of room in the back of the dress so it wasnt as form fitting as i would have liked i ended up returning this dress,0
9248,Got this dress for a party it was a last minute purchase and i was nervous if it would fit it not only fit it looks great and is very comfortable have to love an aline skirt and a top with short sleeves it covers everything while looking sexy and i didnt have to spend a second worrying if something was showing that shouldnt be got compliments all night i got it in red and black but went with the red based on feedback from husband and bff buy it now its perfect for holiday p,1
9249,Pretty cut out design it is a great length for work but it is also unique enough to get compliments the skirt seems true to size but the waist does not have a lot of give in this regard it may seem a little small,1
9250,I saw this top in the store and wanted to try it on but my monthold son was getting cranky so i had to leave i kept thinking about it and was planning to go back and get it and then i checked online and it was on sale i purchased the pink and im ordering the blue as well its very comfortable and i received several compliments when i wore it i havent washed it yet but the fabric seems to be sturdy,1
9251,This sweater coat is perfect ive been looking for one i loved for years in my opinion it runs true to size i ordered my usual xsp it is fitted in the arms and loose on the body i love it,1
9252,Material is strange triangle top is funky this is just not awesome in any way,0
9253,This wide leg pant gives the perception of a skirt that is feminine comfortable and moves beautifully when you walk can be used all year round,1
9254,Stunning sweater for cooler weather i think it runs a little small so returned first one and ordered one size up which fits perfect,1
9255,I had such high hopes for this top the colors the peplum the ruffles the price point the fit was terrible unflattering and laughable please try again with this one retailer you could have a real winner with a little tweaking,0
9256,I cant get enough of this dress this dress is everything from the flattering fit to the colors and pattern to the design and to the quality this dress really has it all this is worth every penny and in my opinion a great price for a versatile high quality dress the material is that super comfy stretchy material which is perfect for everyday it is a no brainer and easy to throw on im so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect it hits at the perfect length for a,1
9257,I love any bow tie tops but most have the bow too high up which looks dowdy i love the layered look and the contrasting colors i am lbs and got the regular xs i wanted the petite xs but it was sold out unfortunately the regular was a little too big but it still works looks great with jeans or dress pantseven a skirt very versatile and classy and creative styling,1
9258,This dress is beautiful and delicate so flattering runs a little big slightly looser fit got the size small usually a and it is perfect the slip included is very sheer however so i am using a different black slip for mine,1
9259,This color is gorgeous this could be dressed up or down great buy,1
9260,I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for springsummer weather i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration i am normally a size in dresses and found this to fit very true to size,1
9261,Love the length and long sleeves so comfy to sleep in great purchase i ordered the navy one too,1
9262,I love this for a casual winter day the fabric is so soft the draping gives it a unique look so cozy and nice its a bit big though opt to size down,1
9263,So first off yes these are almost mindnumbingly expensive however i think the design and quality are absolutely there the label lowrise always makes me wary as someone who is curvy low rise often muffin top danger and bad early s flashbacks but the low rise design of these is actually great they are mainly low rise in the front angling down slightly toward the button and in the back they are not super high but more of a mid rise so you wont have to be really careful ben,1
9264,I loved the cut of these pants and the button accent on the pockets however the material was quite thin and the quality was not great there were multiple snags along the seams additionally at lbs i was swimming in the size i would have tried sizing down if the quality was better,0
9265,I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo however upon arrival i was completely disappointed the color is much more drab than the photo the smudged polkadots werent attractive there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen the dress is super heavy the pleats around the waist did not lay correctlyand it adds pounds to your hips super sad i am sending it back,0
9266,I tried this dress on in the store in the mango color but opted to order the blue the dress is beautifully made and the fit is fantastic,1
9267,Aaaaaaamazing tunic it was love at first sight and the detail is spot on the total weight is heavier than expected but that is due to the impeccable quality of the top,1
9268,An excellent going out to dinner to a lounge etc piece super flattering sexy feminine and trendy can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories im only feet and very wary of jumpsuits but this was excellent,1
9269,Great shirt very soft and comfortable the elastic on top to keep it off shoulders is not too tightjust tight enough the colors are pretty its give a rustic city vibe love,1
9270,So cute i get tons of compliments whenever i wear it very comfortable i ordered a petite l and its a little big i usually buy the petite m but due to the under slip i wasnt sure,1
9271,Ive been shopping with retailer over years and this is my first review i almost didnt order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies im and these jeans are perfection they look amazing with a inch heel i dont think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway love these,1
9272,I have always been a pilcro fan and these are so comfortable and fit well in the legs im and and the size fit very well,1
9273,I technically measure to a medium in both regular and petite sizing but i took a chance an ordered the regular small in red it is as depicted and i agree that it is soft and can be clingy but the regular size fits slightly too big on me this is fine since it would show lumps otherwise i bet this would be perfect had the petite size have been available nonetheless the fabric is substantial enough that it doesnt show the fact i carry weight in my upper body and stomach so im keeping it,1
9274,I loved these pants the minute i put them on and was so happy id ordered them but i wore them only times and only at dinners with friends not even for full days and the seams on both legs ripped open i think the faux leather just isnt equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings i was superbummed about this because these pants are so insanely cute but if they cant hold up to a few casual wears then theres just no way thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom,0
9275,Oh my goodness i paid full price for this dress because i loved it so much i styled it with a cream lace poncho also from retailer and it is gorgeous at the sale price you cant lose,1
9276,I ordered this in a but returned for a because the arm holes were a little tight other than that this is a absolutely flattering dress u will be wearing it for an outdoor garden wedding shower the beading around the flowers makes such a different accent just be careful zipping it up love it,1
9277,I am currently loving anything that crosses or ties around the stomach area to hide whats left from my most recent pregnancy this tunic fits the bill the material has the perfect amount of stretch and the length was just right i am very petite and bought my usual size xs i would have liked to try this tunic in a petite size but then it may have been too short i plan on wearing this to work with leggings and for running errands once the weather warms up,1
9278,I love this sweater dress i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews but fear not friendsthis is a comfortable flattering warm dress with a unique twist i love the cowl and the buttons down the back the knit is fairly large so theres some give to it which means pulling it on is a breeze and the buttons dont slip out of their closures unexpectedly which is an added bonus i ordered both grey and navy i stand at and would describe myself as pearshaped typica,1
9279,I bought these shorts in my usual size small around hipsbutt they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way especially given the drapey fabric theyre made out of the print is gorgeous especially at the waistband you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off the red is a true bright red but beautiful the waistband has a functional drawstring i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying i would not put these in a dry,1
9280,Im thrilled with this purchase and looking forward to spending many years with this classic on the subject of fit i generally wear size medium for tops but my broad shoulders occasionally have me in larges since the thicktextured fabric is mostly cotton and minimal stretch with a mix of linen the larger size will provide more room and comfort im honoring my tts choice for folks who prefer a more fitted look overall this piece wears well,1
9281,I had been looking for a jacket like this for months but havent found the right style until i saw this one luckily it was on sale i am weigh ca lbs and i usually wear a size small in all retailer tops tried on medium but it was too big in the bust area then i tried on the small and it fits great the sleeves are long enough too but it is hard to move my arms up to reach something so i just have to avoid that i have gotten a lot of compliments for it,1
9282,Its a light material so it flows the shine is just enough to dress up when i need im a and usually buy xl of any tshirt looking style but the large fit perfectly i am however not large breasted,1
9283,This top runs huge not only in the torsochest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy i am normally between a ml but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work,0
9284,This top is great for layering or by itself over skinny jeans or leggings im and this is the perfect length,1
9285,Ive owned a number of pilcro denim jackets it in my day not because theyve ever needed to be replaced but because im obsessed with the fit the color and the style when i saw this one i knew it would be no exception this jacket is even cooler looking in person the fade on the denim is totally perfect not too dark not too lightand not so distressed that it looks sloppy the denim is soft just like all other pilcro and the fit is a dream what i love the most is the interest in the c,1
9286,This is a beautiful top extremely classy looks great with dressy trousers or jeans drapes very nicely the petite medium fits me perfectly lb love it the embroidery ads so much so pleased with this purchase,1
9287,Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top its a very romantic comfortable top that has a flattering fit im so glad that it has lining so i dont need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone it has a light fabric so its very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida,1
9288,These make your rear look ahmazing i mean seriously good every time i wear these my husband cannot keep his hands off usually im in these i took a perfection i also got them in the black and blue washes i may not be wearing any of my other jeans at this point so good awesome price point too,1
9289,Love this skirt super comfortable yet nicely tailored roomy pockets always come in handy the dark mustard looks great with the black and white tops that dominate my closet this will be my goto skirt for the fall for both my businesscasual office environment and weekends out and about running errands etc i agree with the other reviewers re sizing because of the stretch if youre between sizes you should size down im usually a medium or size or so i got the i may have been,1
9290,Very cute dress but fabric is very flimsy and seams were very puckered which couldnt be pressed out,0
9291,Amazing they are like those cozy wool socks they are true to size they dont stretch out at least yet even after i stretched etc i am going to get another pair since i envision wearing these often in the cold house,1
9292,Love this top pretty colors and dont forget to notice the black lace at the bottom can easily be dressed up or down with jeans or cigarette black pants and heels everyone looks good with bare shoulders so this is a definite for my fall winter season,1
9293,This color came out after i had purchased the same in the gray motif when i saw this one though i simply had to have it it is such a happy print and different color scheme from anything else in my closet i had purchased the gray one in regular only because the petites were all sold out but i was able to get this one in my usual small petite size it is most definitely a better fitlength for me i dont usually like to pay so much for a tshirt but i will splurge for something like this t,1
9294,Im disappointed in these pants which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets in person the pattern and colors arent as nice the fabric is too thin and the pants look cheap the pockets are pretty shallow the fit isnt good either i ordered up im between sizes and theyre still not as flowy as id have liked these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them so theyre going back if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit they might wo,0
9295,I went back and forth about buying this jumpsuit very glad that i decided to make the purchase i wore the jumpsuit to a holiday party and look forward to pairing it with a blazer for work the material is very soft yet durable i wore with flats but it would be cute with a colorful pair of heels,1
9296,This is an awesome tank top comfortable great fit casual but with ruffles a bit dressier than an ordinary tank top i loved it so much i came back and bought it in the cream color this runs a bit larger and i typically take an extra large but bought this in large and its perfect,1
9297,I cant wear this without getting dozens of compliments plus its comfortable its very soft it is perfect with skinny jeans and boots with pants or with skirts i have paired it with pretty much everything in my wardrobe everyone wants to know where i got it its very well made and the embroidery is well done it doesnt look like it is going to come undone anytime soon,1
9298,I took this into the dressing room for fun and wow so glad i did i got the regular m and it fits perfectly it is very slightly roomy but i think thats the design and it still looks great as a petite the regular m fit perfectly heals or no heals its comfy and lovely,1
9299,These are such a great alternative to actual leather pants they have the perfect amount of stretch and breathability ive always found leather pants to be too hot got the holly color unfortunately the p size was sold out but as another reviewer noted these are easy to roll up i noticed some of the complaints about quality and these not holding up but given the use of two different materials pu and a stretchy material i think its only natural that these would tear along the seams aft,1
9300,Love this sweater comfy and trendy cant wait to wear with my new retailer knit leggings,1
9301,This top is really cute but the threads underneath the shirt scratch your torso i suggest wearing a tank underneath to protect your skin,0
9302,I absolutely love these tees i have them in almost every color i find i can wear them with almost anything can dress them up or downi feel like they are true to size i purchased the small but i probably could have worn an xs too i wanted a looser fitalso they wash and dry well toofor reference d,1
9303,Adorable skirt the eyelet part on the bottom is cutout so see through but cute and subtle found it fit a little snug on me could just be my build but i ordered it in normal size and size up the size up fit best,1
9304,I am so glad that i ordered this top it is kind of shimmering and looks so pretty in person it is nicely lined and i love the sweetheart shape at the front i am b broad shoulder ordered size s and m and they both fit quite nicely the size s is more like a trailered fit on me while the size m gives more room for my arms and shoulder also extra length that i can tuck it in my lowraise demin i ended up keeping size m since i like my tops to fit a bit more flowy i can see myself,1
9305,This is an awesome blouse it is well made the fabric is thick and soft it drapes beautifully i love the tie at the top i wish it came in other colors other than the denim offered i am pounds flat chested the xs fit well,1
9306,This sweater is super cozy and comfy and my new favorite sweater the green is a dark khaki and really pretty its long enough to wear with leggings but not boxy or frumpy,1
9307,Seen it online so i ordered it is so cute great fit patchwork is so pretty very vintage looking runs large would be cute with some skinny jeans and some booties,1
9308,This is a really unique jacket the suedelike darker fabric is so soft and brings great character to the jacket i love the neutral color and the fit is true to size the only minor complaint i have is that the band at the bottom of the jacket flares out a little making it wider and a little odd looking but i have learned to ignore this because all of the other features are so awesome would recommend,1
9309,I was so excited that retailer finally had some bermuda shorts for those of us that are older and dont want to show off that much leg anymore and are curvy on the bottom and really cannot wear the shorter shorts i ordered these immediately in the navy i usually wear a in pilcro jeans and like the other reviewer observed as well i was floating in these not only in the waist but everywhere the legs are big but its supposed to be a boyfriend cut so i get that but they just are,0
9310,I should have listened to previous reviewers but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures when it arrived in the mail i realized this is a mistake it has no shape material is poofy and feels cheap it is going back,0
9311,I just love this well made nice fabric and looks just great over pants or jeans im very pleased with this quirky piece and got it on sale too,1
9312,This is adorable lots of compliments on color great fit,1
9313,This is so pretty it was beautiful in white but i bought the blue because the fabric is a little bit see through im and weigh about and this shirt fit just like on the model in the picture it was a nice neat loose not sloppy at all,1
9314,Super cute very light and flowy i ordered the black packs well wasnt wrinkly when i took it out of the suitcasei ordered the black so happy with my purchase,1
9315,Beautiful and different material like it a lot very happy with the purchase,1
9316,I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and was so bummed to see it on backorder online until may i went to my local store and they had it in stock so i immediately tried it on im not usually a big fan of maxi dresses but this dress is so pretty and the quality is amazing the fabric is light and airy but not too delicate and the subtle beading on the top adds an extra special touch the waist is a little high its similar to the picture online but im also so it mi,1
9317,This top it is so simple but so great at the same time it does run large and im not a skinny girl but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesnt take away from that i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft washedjean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather its casual but so comfy its great for loungin,1
9318,Love this topgot it in both orange and white and always get compliments especially on the orange color beautiful and vibrant color very comfy top and washes well with no problems the style does swing but not too huge,1
9319,I ordered the xxs because it seems like a flowy top and glad i did it fits perfectly love the blue color very rich material is super soft cut is very flattering and i love the back i tried it on with my strapless since that is what i was wearing but not sure if straps show on a regular bra dd for info,1
9320,I am so crazy about this dress i got it in the mail today and just love it no its not lined but its not see through so no big deal i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price,1
9321,This dress fits true to size and is great to wear around on a warm day you can dress it up or down so there are many uses for it this brand has always provided great quality too im excited for warmer weather,1
9322,This dress is simply unique beautiful i said it runs large but that only because the bodice is a little looser than anticipated i decided to stick with my normal size though so i could have a little extra room for those wishing for a tight fit size down i love the colors in this dress i typically shy away from bright colors and pinks but paired with the muted yellowbrown,1
9323,Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details soft and not baggy a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier im pounds with an athletic hourglass shape dd i bought the which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt im normally an retailer small but i dont think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted great comfy weekend piece,1
9324,This top is really cute the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size love the back detailing and it is really good tshirt quality,1
9325,I am and curvy and purchased this dress in medium petite and it fits to perfection i love how light breezy it is for those hot muggy summer days the tie front makes this style very flattering for all body types and the skirt is lined so it is not seethrough plus the pockets this dress is a winner,1
9326,This dress had so much potential the top was absolutely gorgeous my issue was with the bottom half of the dress the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead,0
9327,Recently bought these on sale though they were still a bit in the expensive side im and typically a size the xs fits perfectly the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model but im fine with that the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy as sometimes happens with this style,1
9328,These pants are wonderful they are very flattering the color is gorgeous and they are incredibly comfortable got tons of complements,1
9329,I got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package one side is see through so i wore a camisole underneath its lightweight and not at all clingy i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me perfect sweater for a fall day in new england,1
9330,My new favorite i purchased the ivory in a medium and the lilac in a large when it went on sale medium was already sold out im and about pounds c give or take the medium fits great and i found the large only slightly bigger but it does not look too big i usually wear a small or medium in most retailer sweatersas was previously noted the back is cut higher than pictured i actually like this as it gives the sweater a unique look i tend to layer with a button down for the,1
9331,I have been searching my entire marriage years for the perfect christmas and valentines day dress it had to be red it had to be the right red and it had to be my style there were several i saw over the years that were either too burgundy or too matronly when i saw this dress i knew my year search was over this is the most beautiful and elegant red specialoccasion dress i have ever seen i cannot wait to wear it for christmas i think retailer should have reordered thi,1
9332,I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy anotherbeware because the color names are confusing i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the red thinking id get the red colored tee however the red tee is actually a light orange color the orange tee is actually a burgundyred colori ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color because i really do love the quality of this shirt,1
9333,I knew i would love these pants because of the cute sailor styling but the unusual green color i am and thought i would be stepping on them but i am fine they are longer than the picture with the model on the website which i expected but they are fine the fabric is beautiful and i cant wait to wear them with my whiteonwhite sneakers i will also mix it up with sandals i wrote below that my style is bohemian but truthfully i dress in all the ways listed belowclassic romantic,1
9334,These jeans are extremely soft to the rich as well as stretchy and flattering they do not lose their shape after a whole day of wear i am and the ankle length fits me as full length i am a big fan,1
9335,Fits well and appropriate for work or going out love the pop of red in the beads could easily be worn with a jacket well into fall i typically wear a and a small fit perfectly not too short but hits above the knee this will get lots of wear,1
9336,The top is cute but when i received it it did not feel like cotton the tag says viscose i hope retailer can be more accurate with fabric content in the future on the plus side the return was no problem,0
9337,I bought the top that goes with the pants live that its comfortable to wear at home yet looks good enough to to go anywhere easy to care for very happy with this,1
9338,Very comfortable to wear you can wear it any season it runs true to size nice fabric itamps a simple black dress love it,1
9339,Love this top its everything all the previous viewers saidexcept that the white isnt white but a creamy whiteit has a yellow under tone this restricts my over all plansbut i still like it,1
9340,I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too super cute with jeans can dress it up too the only slight negative if i had to find one is that i feel like i have to pull it forward at the neckline every once in a whileit doesnt choke me but just feels like its heavier in the back so pulls a bit worth it though,1
9341,This is a great sweater it can be worn wrapped as on the model or open like a cardigan it is a lighter weight knit perfect for how warm this winter has been i love the deep purple color normally between a small and medium and went with the medium in this sweater,1
9342,Didnt like the dress look pregnant in it this dress is going back,0
9343,This picture does not do this blouse justice the material is velour where the flowers are and theres a bit of sparkle im generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased its true to size im and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all i wont have to shorten it the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion its gorgeous,1
9344,This shirt runs true to size im an xl and it fit perfectly that is my first reason for loving it it is super soft and so comfortable i dont want to take it off the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots which i love the ruffle of the shoulders im not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different the color of the photo is very accurate i love the muted pink in the plaid,1
9345,It is hard to believe that this is called a chemise it is a fabulous dress this dress caught my eye in the store and i had to try it on i went with the navy which is beautiful and has a great pattern i had to order a petite xs because the regular xs was loose in my shoulder area i am petite and narrow and the petite xs was perfect for me it is quite form fitting and does show curves lumps and bumps so i wore my dress with spanx tights it was such an easy dress to wear looked styl,1
9346,I was looking for a simplistic dress because i am graduating in a few weeks but did not really want to purchase anything i strolled in the store and this immediately caught my eye i tried it on and fell in love it fits perfectly and it is the right length i love the bust line and the detailing of the straps in the back i dont think i feel as though i am going to a weddingbut i will feel beautiful especially since this is really big deal and accomplishment i am an older adult so i want,1
9347,I agree with the other reviewers the fabric is beautiful although i wish they would start making blouses again that didnt require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness i mean for the price shouldnt it be lined or something when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i cant really complain too much plus they are so loosely sewn on that after minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off i gave up at that,0
9348,I love these pants they are beautifully made and appear to be very comfortable now if i could just get them buttoned i am a size medium i bought the large after reading other reviews im not joking when i say i cant button them i am in such love with them and still hoping to lose some baby weight that i am going to keep them in hopes to wear them,1
9349,Love the distressed look and linenlike texture the back ties cinch in for a custom fit the knit hood is a nice touch the length is great fits tts exactly as depicted if not slightly roomy which i like absolutely fabulous,1
9350,Well made color is great goes from summer right into fall looks good with sandles and will wear with boots later on goes well with classic tee denim shirt or plaid blouse has a retro classic look,1
9351,This is online exclusive so i ordered both sizes xs and s it runs pretty large so i kept size xs the material can be stretched but i like the feeling of it and very comfortable to your skin i am so happy receiving so many compliments wherever i go,1
9352,So stunning i had to have it for my spring wardrobe fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom the model weara it just as it fits on me if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isnt stretchy,1
9353,Very comfortable and easy to dress up or down i get tons of complaints on this dress its a definite win,1
9354,Runs small arms very short and hits in the wrong place across your chest would not recommend,0
9355,I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides be creative and wear it different ways,1
9356,I loved the layered look without all the bulk the different textures make it so interesting,1
9357,I bought this dress in the print and the moss color and may very well return for the dark gray for reference i am lbs i have been more recently wearing size but a was perfect so i do think it runs a bit large this dress has a drawstring that ties in the back and cinches the waist up nicely and is very flattering the waist actually hits at the natural waistline and not up on the ribs the fabric is lightweight and washes well i washed and immediately hung dry it was slight,1
9358,I waited patiently for this dress to arrive in my local retailer store and loved the design immediately the green motif as others noted it is on the flowly side for this reason i went with a size s i wore it on easter and cant wait to wear it again i did not have any issues with wrinkling or putting on the dress it is a simple over the head no fuss kind of dress you get to be supremely comfortable and look like a goddess this is one of those retailer pieces that you will have for years,1
9359,I was so excited to receive this dress i got a petite as i am it was very hard to zip up the side zipper but not impossible it didnt look good on me the waist line was a bit too highmaybe a regular would have looked better also i thought it was a cotton dress but it isnt also i looked like i was going to a nordic folk festival to do a traditional dance i had been so excited to receive this but sadly it just didnt work for me and i had to send it back,0
9360,This has instantaneously become my favorite sweater in my closet the fit is great a little oversized which makes it very cozy i purchased my usual size xs the shade of red is perfection i wished it was a tad bit softer but would buy again and again,1
9361,This is a beautiful well designed top the pattern is laid out to match on each side the back has a narrow center insert of sheer fabric for an interesting detail with wonderful construction this sheer fabric is also added to the bottom as an edging this measures only wide and lays flat and finished off well the sleeves have excess fabric for comfort but do not make ones arms look heavy the unusual neckline shape in the front is well sewn and lays flat nicely i think this top is,1
9362,I bought this top in lavender this top is light and smooth on your body and true to size im dd lbs m fits well it hides the imperfections in the tummy area and i find myself going for this top a lot its a very easy to put on and take to it off,1
9363,I really love these jeans they are so comfortable and are very flattering i am and a size i bought the regular and they fit perfectly i have high hips so i appreciate the mid rise in these the length was perfect too so im glad i did not purchase the tall the length was the same on me as in the picture the jeans arrived uncuffed and they look just as cute without the cuff as they do with i will definitely wear them with and without a cuff for different looks i am very happy,1
9364,I purchased this in the light red and love it this top is so incredibly soft and ridiculously comfortable definitely worth buying the material is high quality and can easily shift from season to season wear alone with shorts and wedges for summer or put it over a long sleeve top or even a holding horses jean shirt with a pair of black leggings and boots for fall absolutely love the softness and the consistency of the fabric,1
9365,I ordered this in a b lbs because it looked like it would run big and it definitely does the fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about lbs heavier than i am i am pearshaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy so i returned it that said the material is gorgeous as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person if i had a straighter silhouette and a larger bust this dress would have been a,0
9366,I bought this on sale in black it doesnt look like much online but it is very flattering and super thin and airy which is great for warm weather tts im an c and the fits just right,1
9367,This blouse is adorable very flattering wrap design especially on my small chested body also the black and white is very appealing cant wait for warmer weather so i can wear it,1
9368,Based on the two reviews on this skirt and for the sale price i purchased the smalli m usually a largeextra large i carry my weight in the middle and this skirt stills works very sofisticated striping slimming i havent experienced any slipping but i havent worn it for any great length of time yet there are numerous ways to create chic looks,1
9369,Love this blouse i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs which fits perfectly not form fitting but flattering washes beautifully too i highly recommend this blouse,1
9370,I loved the print on both but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel i went ahead and ordered the cat one today the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit size down for myself m was perfect since im built larger and broader on top the top is a bit long covers my hips and some of my bottom its a mixed fabric design so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types,1
9371,Absolutely love this jacketinitially wanted to buy the melita draped jacket which looks similar to this one and tried them both on in store the latter just didnt drape properly and looked more like a bathrobe on me but this piece is amazing it falls nicely and the pockets jut out a bit giving it a unique look the fabric is fluid and soft and it has a tie waist with another tie in the back of the jacketmiddle bottom which is a bit of an added but subtle flair the color is a bit more t,1
9372,I bought this top in the black with the dobby shorts in grey and wore them as a set of the days last weekendmind you i am tall but the neckline is lovely the smocking creates a nice close drape and the length and the fullness in the bottom perfectly offset the shortshort concept got lots of compliments with the i generally wear a and ordered a medium which was fit nicely with enough room for a wash and dry going forward,1
9373,I have these pants in a larger size but recently lost some weight and wanted a smaller sizethey are so comfortable and soft and go with everythingkeep in mind that they run a little large and do stretch a bit once you wear themjust wish they would be available in tall,1
9374,I purchased the navy color of this dress not only did it look good but felt good as well since it is for a wedding i also purchased a white crochet cropped sweater to wear over as well making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom could not have been happier,1
9375,This dress like all byron lars dresses is a work of art it has true quality of workmanship and fits like a glove i always get compliments when i wear any of his dresses and i have this one is somewhere between casual and dressy perfect for a dinner out on a saturday night order a petite if you are under,1
9376,I have a hard time finding jeans that fit and these ones are just right i am ish lbs and the s fix perfectly they hug in all the right places and they are the perfect length i will be wearing them uncuffed there is no effort required to uncuff them theyre not sewn or anything they have just the right amount of stretch and love the little cute details throughout them thank you retailer for always helping me find great jeans,1
9377,These are the perfect dressy jeans they are super soft but have the right amount of structure they sit higher on the waist which is one reason they are so flattering the other reason is the flared long leg very long in fact im lbs and ordered a size they fit me perfectly but i do have to wear them with my tall heels which makes them perfect for work with pumps as well as for casual outfits with tall wedges if my size wasnt sold out id order another pair they are,1
9378,I am really into this jacket the fit is nice although it does very slightly large however not enough to go down a size for me all of the different textures are really cool and the details do seem to be pretty slimming which is always a bonus i am a bit worried that the wool will pill like crazy though lets hope im wrong and that it lasts,1
9379,Cozy and beautiful everything dreamy sleep pants should be great for gifting make bedtime feel a little more pampered,1
9380,Love this tshirt i live in miami and have a month old so i practically live in shorts and tshirts and this shirt fits beautifully and adds a little extra pop to your everyday t love the material too,1
9381,I love love love this print and had to have it when retailer had their off sale i think regular price is way too much for this dress as the dress isnt even silk or a better material but once i got this i was so disappointed i ordered my usual size and it was just a balloontent on me i felt like i was wearing a maternity dress plus the ruffle at the top which i thought was a sweet feature felt really awkward and like it was grazing my neck and chin in an annoying way i dont even want t,0
9382,dd size top and bottomthese tank tops are literally the best thing i have ever purchased from retailer the colors and patterns are gorgeous i have four of these yellow green navy birds and the white with navy flower the top layer and middle liner are heavy high quality polyester the bottom layer is a comfortable knit the extra layers make this top warmer than most tanks its perfect for layering under a sweater or jacket its very loose and flowy i could have,1
9383,Love these jeans fit great ive had other colored denim from ag that stretched out too much were too thin but these are a nice thicker fabric i ordered the red and the moss and the red fit a little better than the moss in the same size not sure if the dye process affects the fabric but the red pair seemed a bit more substantial the moss is great too though so i may keep both,1
9384,This dress is beautiful even my husband complimented it several times true to size due to the button closure in the back you might have to size up if you are larger in the chest,1
9385,Beautiful fabric unfortunately i had to return it after just one wear it had pills all over the side fabric is too delicate sad to return,0
9386,Great shirt the material is lightweight without being see through i didnt find the cut to be all that flattering but it was a cute enough style and comfortable enough that i wanted to keep it definitely see it becoming a staple in my closet,1
9387,Loving this top feels comfy and casual like a sweatshirt but pairs great with a pencil skirt or dress pants to wear to work easy to dress up and down and i get so many compliments on it its fraying a tiny bit on the front but i think that adds to the notsoprecious vibe im and the m works great,1
9388,This vest is perfect i live in florida aka where it is hot almost every day of the year it makes a great layer piece but isnt too warm,1
9389,The black band seemed to cut across the widest part of my hips emphasizing them the pants are sheer the fabric was not comfortable against my skin overall the pants were a miss,0
9390,Beautiful beautiful beautiful goes great with pilcro stet big rise grey jeans and deep green hei jeans i wear this on shoulders vs off so lovely beautiful rich earth tone colors and live the lace bottom can dress up with black skirt or black skinnies and heels highly recommend,1
9391,I found this as a return in the store i tried the xxs i was so excited because it looked really cute on the hanger it was so huge looked like i was wearing an xl,0
9392,Once this caught my eye i couldnt let it go i kept revisiting itthinking it was too expensive probably itchytoo bulky a problem if you wanted to eat somethingbut the color looked yummy so i finally ordered itand im so pleased i did the shape is actually easy to wear its not chopped it drapes nicely over my hips and it isnt itchyi would not wash the dishes with this sweater onbut you could dress it up with velvet pants for a party or more casually with jeans,1
9393,I studied this dress for weeks before i finally bought it i am soooo glad i bought it much more fabulous than the picture soft quality denim that is not too heavy for summer very fitted on top love the pockets and the torn hem,1
9394,Fit is perfect body slimming im glad i purchased it,1
9395,I ordered a pair online they came today and i am in love the fit is great i love the high rise waist i will have to hem the bottom i am a tad short and it is rare that i dont have to hem my jeans they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit i am very pleased with my purchase,1
9396,The pattern is pretty subtle almost looks like one color so it is more versatile as i would have originally thought the fabric is so soft the collar is removable but i love the look with it on the way it closes is lobsterlike clasps so you can wear it closed or open sizing is a bit big as in the xxs p fit me perfectly didnt even try on the xs p this will keep me warm and looked nice with a pant outfit i tried on as well as a dress recommend sizing reference lbs dd,1
9397,Skirt has lots of stretch and comes up to waistline so i am not sure yet how i will wear it but tucked in or out it looks very stylish and the dark denim is of course slimming,1
9398,This dress is really beautiful and high quality the pattern color and fabric are great the fit is flattering im hourglass to pear shaped and the size perfect for me in petite please keep offering high quality clothes in petite sizes by higher end designers,1
9399,Super cute and comfy pull over sizing is accurate material has a little bit of stretch,1
9400,I just received these sweaterscouldnt decide which color i liked bestblue and green are my favsand so i ordered them boththey are a wow i am totally in love with both of themthey are sooooooooooooooo beautifulbeyond my wildest expectationsi wear a size and ordered the size and it fits perfectlya is a size medium per call to retailer before i orderedand is small ad is extra smallthis is a bulky cuddly winter sweater with a touch of glam w,1
9401,This skirt is great to wear to work nice medium weight being cotton it doesnt get to hot skirt is lined nice flattering shape my normal size fit perfect love the godets comfortable doesnt get all wrinkled from sitting nice royal blue color,1
9402,These pants are great the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater another great find from retailer,1
9403,Cute top agree with other reviewer that it is really nice in person the colors are rich and the embroidery is beautiful it is a very full swing top but be aware that the sides are a few inches shorter than the front and back this isnt evident in the photo shown i usually wear a sm in retailer tops and the small looks larger on me than how it fits on the model in fullness and especially in the arms its still cute enough to keep but i personally probably could have gone down a size,1
9404,I love these pants so comfortable and can be dressed up and dressed down love them,1
9405,I loved the star pattern of this top but the cut was odd it is very big in the chest and full at the bottom for anyone who is petite on top it tends to look sloppy,0
9406,Fit great with moving room colors very vibrant just right for a house with lots of cool air conditioning,1
9407,I ordered this top in xl in the navy print it fits true to size its made of two very soft materials the printed part looks like sailboats to me it doesnt wrinkle or have a static problem the solid knit portion is a good quality too i love the styling details of the ruffled neck and the middle pleat its flattering i like how the details make this a dressy version of a tshirt while being very comfortable too,1
9408,Flowy comfy plaid dress perfect for the fall or winter front is much shorter than the back at the front is nearly too short on me but works with a pair of tights dress has a cami slip underneath which is needed as the blue detailing across the chest and down the center is sheer adding to how special the dress is can be made more or less casual based on accessories and footwear,1
9409,These jeans are so comfortable they are wellmade they are the perfect pair of jeans the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing i am going to order these again in the next smaller size,1
9410,The jeans look so different online the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut the rise is not as stated and is actually inches also im a true and the waist is like a but the legs are super skinny im so disappointed and im not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size these look more like mens cut jeans,0
9411,I love the style of this top theres good stretch to the fabric so its very flattering the length is good for me as the previous review stated its a little long but for me its lengthening the lace is lovely too ill wear it with some white jeans for summer,1
9412,One of pair of leggings ordered and the only pair to fit properly size l was perfect for me they stretched nicely going on and the beautiful floral design on the legs didnt get distorted or faded looking from the stretch wearing these makes me happy,1
9413,I was in trouble when i saw this dress in the new arrivals section this month its one of those dresses i had to have for the holidays i didnt want to risk it not fitting so i ordered my usual size and also a size up lbs size well the was entirely to tight i couldnt even zip past my rib cage the went on but it was very body con looking hugged every curve this might be the look some might be going for but not me im so disappointed that i cant have the dress f,1
9414,I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own this one is no exception i bought it in black last week size s for my birthday treat and it was so wonderfully light during the week of f heat in the district its feminine and delicate in appearance yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable its awesome just a perfect summer and probably fall dress,1
9415,Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,1
9416,This dress is so flattering on i was astounded often the waistline in the petite dress are very high even though im only tall but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring would be great for work or church but unfortunately doesnt really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price i highly recommend,1
9417,Great shirt the neckline is super flattering the fabric has some weight to it right now i am in a fat stageand it still looked good it will look even better without the midriff bulge i bought the shirt in black im thinking of ordering it in redits that good,1
9418,This print combination is like an arts and crafts wallpaper sampler and is simply beautiful size down and tuck it in for the best look but wear a highwaist bottom with it since it runs a bit shortin the torsoi didnt find the same transparency problem of which other reviewers complain,1
9419,I love this shirt so much i ordered the gray a day after i received the sage color this shirt is soft true to size comfortable and extremely flattering it is one of my new favorite goto shirts retailer great job at finding a stylish casual top that can take me through all the seasons,1
9420,This dress is beautiful and fit exactly as pictured im lbs and a size fit perfectly,1
9421,Saw these at my local retailer store and almost didnt try them on so glad i did they made my legs look long and lean they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips butt and thighs the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable i love how i look in these,1
9422,The details on these capris are adorable the stitching and side ribbon detail the fit weight of the fabric everything is fantastic i got the taupe and moss green because i couldnt decide i wish they came in more colors fit for me was true to size i usually wear a to a size to in denim and got the because i wanted them to be more fitted they stretched a bit after wear but not so much that they were too baggy i will live in these this summer if you want a more fitted,1
9423,I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured id try it anyway this dress is to die for the xs fit me just fine though the snap at the chest wouldnt stay closed but i thought it looked ok i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it im contemplating purchasing it still because i cant stop thinking about it,1
9424,The quality is there these pants are just as pictured very wide leg romantic pants the pockets lay nicely inside so as not to be bunchy like some pants do these fit perfect and look great,1
9425,I am an retailer employee i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store they both loved the piece before they tried it onthe jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives the lining is to short makes it feel awkward i ordered the xxs petite and it fits perfect except the inside l,1
9426,As the other reviewers stated it does run large i sized down size and its perfect great dress to wear so many ways,1
9427,Hi i would have to agree with all of the reviewersi unfortunately had to find out for myself mistake its huge i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it wouldnt help,0
9428,I ordered a petite small im lbs and b and the length was perfect and the fit was great like the previous reviews love you can wear a bra with it,1
9429,This is a great dress both in design and comfort the material is very soft and warm yet it is also very stylish and can be dressed up with big necklaces a belt and boots the stylist in the store mentioned wearing it with a vest it is a great piece that has so many possibilities i bought it in navy thank you retailer,1
9430,It has been a long cold winter and springbut it is going to get hotand this is a perfect dress for julyi tried this on and did not feel the need for a slip or a cami yes it is lightweight no i would not consider it for work but when it gets hot in the summer i feel like this will be a perfect slip on and go dress for days or casual eveningsi wear a and the medium fit perfectlyi considered ordering the small since i had some extra space but again it is going to get hot,1
9431,I dont buy many jackets retired but i think they are still useful i had my doubts about this jacket like could they really get the trim straight at this price but they did the jacket is casual but sophisticated i got the grey and the color is just as pictured i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet i am pleased and i think you will be too,1
9432,I saw this dress in the window at the roc center nyc store and knew i had to have it the one i chose has muted earthtone colors of tan green gold looks stunning with my complexion the blue one was nice too but the earth tones were more flattering on me the fit is loose and flowy very comfortable but not baggy im c ish and i took my usual xs i plan to pair it with a muted green leather jacket and brown boots for the fall cant wait,1
9433,I dont have anything but raves here this is a perfectly proportioned jumpsuit of high quality fabric in a neutral color which is like a denim looking blue color with a beige starburst pattern much much nicer in person than in the product photo and has a really neat slightly nubby texture that adds interest its easy to get in and out of the back of the waistband is elastic and stretches so the only thing you have to do is tie the back which is really easy the top as someone menti,1
9434,I got the dress with the boat pattern such a fun dress and very flattering it is definitely a coral but i am able to wear this with my fair skin and will probably look better with some color as springsummer finally arrive i am only so the length is great for me i can wear this to work but it would be pretty short for a tall gal definitely recommend,1
9435,I got the black in an xs and it fits wells its a bit warmer than i expected i love the design of this sweater perfect with leggings,1
9436,Guess i shouldve looked at the pictures more closely i ordered the white version and in the pictures you cant see that the sleeves are split and it barely shows in the picture for the blue version it also wouldve helped if the detail of the sleeves were noted in the item description anyway i will be returning this top because i dont like the way the sleeves look each time i bend my arms looks a bit piratelike to me,0
9437,This colors and fabric of this dress are beautiful and i really wanted to love it but from the chest to the hips there is too much fabric and it give you no shape at all it had to go back,0
9438,Beautiful sweater perfect length surprisingly warm,1
9439,Bought this in pink for a wedding this summer the dress detail is noted as a swing silhouette should be perfect for twirling on the dance floor the bit of orange under layer peaking out from underneath is just the right amount of contrast to the bright pink a pair of heels will make this dress look perfect,1
9440,Tla got it right this time love the fabric the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green exactly as pictured the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons exactly as it looks on line i certainly recommend this top love it,1
9441,Quirky tunic length top has a windowpane print on the inside and the grey plaid looks like flannel but is cotton the red burgandy embroidery adds punch and it has a boho flair size down one size runs big,1
9442,Awesome fabric wonderfully flattering cut love the blue and green colors,1
9443,Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges im a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesnt make the wearer look big it falls elegantly and in a flattering waygreat versatile shirt,1
9444,I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it it shrunk so much it became unwearable when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened,0
9445,This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho it is very flattering and i always get compliments when i wear it must have,1
9446,Retailer has great designs but sometimes they use cheap fabrics and are not quality made this top is quality made and super soft its a little thicker than a normal cotton tshirt but thinner than a sweatshirt i normally wear medium dd lbs and this was tts i got the blue and its a little bit darker in person one big plus imo is that you can put it in washer and dryer no need to line dry i am going to buy the natural colored stripes one too also i bought the normal size,1
9447,I just received these denim joggers this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning i like the decorative band i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe the possibilities with these joggers are endless,1
9448,Again maeve knocks it out of the park with this skirt great quality style and comfort i love that its machine washable so great and versatile for work or a night out this is not a con but might be a bit long for short ladies im and its below the knee,1
9449,To sum up my review at the beginning i walked out to my best friend and two retailer employees and all of them stopped and said whoa its an understated stunneri tried this dress on a whim and boy am i glad i did im lb b with weight carried on the bottom usually wear a size in fit and flare dresses the size fit like a glove hereim shocked at just how incredible the lace is thick well laid on the base dress fabric gorgeous without being too lacy the base fabri,1
9450,I love this dress i dont have many pink things but saw someone in this on instagram and had to have it it is as comfy as a nightgown it has pockets i tried it with brown sandals as well as with a dark jean jacket and taggart grey booties and looks cute both ways also looks great with a blingy necklace tts got my normal med and its roomy but not too big,1
9451,this looks so cute on the model doesnt it i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants but it looks cute that said keep in mind the model is probably feet inches tall im feet inches tall and this jacket came down to my knees im not kidding the length sleeves were at my wrist so more like sleeves im normally a size in cartonnier jackets but this only comes s m or l the medium is really a size which was too tight across the shoulders and,0
9452,I ordered this online having never seen it in person i loved it as soon as i touched the soft material it fits me perfectlyi almost invariably wear a size in retailer dresses and tops which gave me the confidence to order online and this dress is true to size the detailing at the bosom is so flattering the fabric is supple and hangs gracefully without clinging to my notsoperfect waistline i have worn this twice already having received it only a week ago the blueblack combi,1
9453,This dress is super bulky and unflattering the knit is loose and seethrough looks like it was knitted by a fiveyear old if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you back to the store it goes,0
9454,I just bought this cardigan in black at the store and i love it the tie at the waist is flattering and the fabric is soft and stretchy the regular size fit me perfectly as far as where the waist and hem hit although the sleeves had to be turned up im with more length in torso than limbs i was so happy with the fit other than sleeve length that i bought the regular small rather than coming online for the petite because the fabric is rather thin and the shape trim i can fold the sleev,1
9455,I have another sanctuary vest similar to this one and decided i needed to snag this one in the moss green its so pretty and its extremely versatile im months pregnant and its been a fun vest to wear over a tank with a necklace i can see this piece working for all seasons if the other color would have been available i would have grabbed it especially at the sale price you cant beat it the only downside to this vest is that compared to my other medium sanctuary vest this one is a b,1
9456,I didnt think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold yes it is seethrough but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work the best feature even though its silk and the tag says dry clean only you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles i took my usual small im c and lbs and love how versatile this blouse will be,1

9458,Cute style cute color cute cut and i got it on sale,1
9459,Love it it does run big so i had to return for smaller size fabric is nice very true to picture,1
9460,Cloth stone has to be one of the best brands at retailer they consistently produce versatile comfortable and quality pieces time and again off the shoulder is back and here to stay and without a doubt this is one of the best ive tried on the denim is a perfect summery shade but will transition well into fall with some darker denim or black jeans i am shoulders that are neither narrow nor broad and a little busty i got a size m and it fits great i absolutely love my shir,1
9461,All i really need to say is this is the perfect layering piece i love that you have a choice in the neckline that you want to wear form flattering and is true to size,1
9462,Dress is much different in person thin ribbed cotton a little tight for xl it looks like a throw back dress from contempos returned and would not recommend,0
9463,I like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice the length of the sleeves adn the subtle cut out at the neck the cut is very flattering adn i am glad the daker color is at the top hte bottome color would wash me out i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me petite would be too short for my liking regular hit just above the knee,1
9464,I tried this on in the store the embroidery is very nice and the shirt is very flattering however because of all the stitching the shirt is a bit stiff on top there is not much give i am also concerned that after washing it it will look terrible so i passed,1
9465,This is my second jacket from this brand cartonnier and i am thoroughly pleased i love the quality and texture of the fabric of this coat i think the styling is super classic with a little bohemian edge i am and lbs and the size fit me perfectly,1
9466,I love love love this dress it fits perfectly it is comfortable and can be dressed up or down i get compliments on it every time i wear it,1
9467,I grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress and it left me puzzled the print was pretty but no amount of tailoring could save it for me it was wearing me maybe it could wear three of me i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners by making a garment without details no installing more time consuming zippers buttons or snaps and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it,0
9468,This is a fun cozy sweater i feel you can dress it up and use it casual too i bought the ivory in size s im although i put it runs true to size its is a tad tight around my upper arms not uncomfortable i have normal to somewhat skinny arms so i dont think it was my body type i didnt check other sweaters in the same size to see if it was an isolated case it is to be worn loose it has quite a bit of material all around mid to lower part just fyi,1
9469,I have several of these tanks from last year and bought new colors this year i have found the fit to be easy and relaxed but not baggy they are very flattering i wear them thru the fall and winter as layering pieces under sweaters and flannel shirts as well i was them in cold water delicate cycle hang to dry and they are good to go they have held up well even the ones that are years old are still going strong with no holes or tears,1
9470,Just received and tried it on right away really flattering fit and comfortable unusual neckline that you can wear plain or accessorize im so happy i decided to take a chance on this one,1
9471,This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear i thought this looked whimsical fun and a welldesigned piece when i saw it on lineespecially at this high price i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today it is not expensive looking at all and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail it is a bit juvenile too even if you wore it and were going for ironic it would be difficult to,0
9472,This dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly,1
9473,I liked the look of this online but its even nicer in person just the right length on the hips a medium weight and with enough interest and exposure on the shoulders to make it feel like a stylish option for a slightly cool night without falling into the tooheavy and makesyoufeeldumpy category of sweater like the slightly short sleeves too,1
9474,This dress is amazing i have it in almost every color it is incredibly comfortable and versatile you can dress it up or down love it,1
9475,I ordered this in the plum color which in real life just looks like a very very dark brown that would probably be okay but the dress is actually about inches shorter than the listed measurements i ordered the regular length but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thighway way too short i am for reference lastly i think the fabric is just awful quality especially for this price point the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself worn ou,0
9476,I ordered this skirt online in a size but returned for a so it could sit a bit lowerthe fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year longso glad i made this purchase,1
9477,The top is just as shown in the picture and it is tts lots of detailing with beads and lace im lbs and purchased a petite just as the other reviewers noted the side slits do come high high waisted jeans or leggings works perfectly,1
9478,This is a beautiful sweater it is not too heavy and the variation in knit from front to back makes not the same old boring sweater the color is gorgeous,1
9479,This dress runs a bit small in my opinion for reference im a c and usually a the medium is tight at the bust the material is beautiful but it looks like a petite cut on me the sleeve and overall length are too short and im going to return it,1
9480,Ive been looking for a nice affordable robe for awhile and this is the one its so soft and the design makes you feel fancy when you wear it perfect for lounging doing my nails or wearing a face mask,1
9481,I have been on the hunt for a black pencil skirt so i decided to give this one a try based on the previous review i love it i didnt size up went with p in waist lbs ish inches hips the waist is fitted the stylist said when she tried it on it pooched but i didnt feel that way on me i had a simple tshirt on and it looked so cute the petite length was also perfectly on point the lace part hit me above the knee and the lining a little over that perfect and flattering,1
9482,This dress is even better in person i am usually a size and i went up to a it is my favorite dress this spring it is so cute with booties or sandals i would say that it runs slightly small so you should get the next size up if youre busty or have hips it has been selling fast you should get it while you can,1
9483,This dress is seriously gorgeous and even more so in person the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy pear shaped and hourglass shaped women i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering love the fabric fit and style of this dress,1
9484,I love this top the neckline is so unusual and so flattering i am normally either a small or xs but this fit great in the xs i was also able to wear a regular bra which is always nice since i am large chested great tophighly recommend,1
9485,Very flattering tee nice details qualitymy first time purchasing this brand but will look for similar items from them,1
9486,These pants are really cute and comfortable the fit is very nice,1
9487,Love this cardigan the quality is beautiful and and comfortable i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch,1
9488,Love this top yes it is a swing top so you have to be prepared for the extra fabric fits true to size thru the shoulders and chest body of the top then flares for the swing effect great top plan on ordering it in the other colors,1
9489,Just got these and they are greati ordered mine online and took the advice of many reviewers to size down i usually wear a sometimes a but got these in a and they are perfect the material is soft and stretchy would highly recommend these to all,1
9490,The romper is well made and just plain cute i bought it the second i saw it and dont regret my impulse buy one bit and the small fit perfectly,1
9491,I really like this shirt and have gotten plenty of compliments the first time ive worn it,1
9492,Possibly my favorite retailer purchase ever like wearing a cloud fit perfectly if youre busty not sure about it but otherwise wow told my husband hope you like it because youll be seeing it all the time he not only agreed but wanted to know if they made pajamas for men,1
9493,I honestly have to give these jeans stars i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them i got tons of compliments they are super comfortable too i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe,1
9494,I love this tank the colors are great and the fit is flattering the fabric is lightweight but not cheap or so thin that you need to wear something under it i am and the length was fine for me,1
9495,This is more of a cover up than something you would wear out,0
9496,I was so so excited to get this sweater in the mail unfortunately the sweater is lined with the same material very soft and warm btw as the polka dots which sheds like crazy i wore a white tshirt under this for the first time and my shirt was covered in black fuzz by the end of the day so much so that i was gathering balls of it to be thrown away very disappointed a lint roller cant even clean up the tshirtin terms of sizing this fits tts i normally wear a l or xl got this in an,0
9497,Very nice but thin materal very sheer i paired with the palmarosa wide legs loved the way it looked i do think the sale price is a bit high for this shirt though,1
9498,I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it even though the design is adorable the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear after a month and a couple washes it looks horrible it may be the worst case of pilling ive ever seen in a fabric so so disappointed it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time,0
9499,I own many retailer dresses but the sizing can be odd i usually wear a size and i have a floreat maxi dress size that works well i am c and based on the reviews i decided to order a size the dress fits well except for he bust area that is very snugcouldnt even get the zipper up i will probably have to order a size to be able to close the zipper on the bust area but it will be huge everywhere elsethe fabric seems very delicate and may develop runs easily its a shame because th,0
9500,This dress is perfection great quality fabric bright vibrant color the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down i sized up a size because my normal wasnt available and it fits perfectly,1
9501,These joggers are amazing they fit true to size if not a bit loose i purchased my usual small size the seams are sewn perfectly and the fabric is dreamy i wore these to work with sandals and was so comfy and appropriate all day in the hot weather the color is a deep gray and goes with everything the front panel makes them a bit more fitted and there is even back pockets,1
9502,I tried this in store and fell in love im usually between a and a in tops and took this in a because of how flow and lose this is the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in,1
9503,Ordered this coat in a small it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect im and weigh around the sleeves are slightly longer than the fabric is so soft the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child she referred to it as her car coat i believe that was a style then worth the,1
9504,I saw this top at my local retailer and instantly fell in love i didnt even try it on first because i just knew when i finally got home and tried it on it didnt disappoint ultra feminine and sexy at the same time the delicate high neck coupled with the exposed cut in shoulders really sold this for me then you come to appreciate the beautiful sewn in flowers loved this oneso much prettier in person than online,1
9505,Beautiful design and soft warm wool warm enough to have on outside in the fall i live in pdx and also stylish enough to keep on inside buy the right size not too big because its meant to fit on the waist and the skirt swings out from there,1
9506,The tee looks longer on the model i am feet and this tee is showing of my belly which surprise me a bit i thought it would hit the waist line still very nice tee i love cotton it simply is the best colors are nice too,1
9507,Not at all tapered at waist as suggested here by photos i have wide shoulders and am slim and this made me look big all around i am doubtful a smaller size would correct this i am and ordered a medium also it curls under a bit at the waist one nice thing about the cream is that it is not see through anyway i purchased this to go with high waisted skirts but am returning,0
9508,Originally i bought this in black and white recently purchased several more in different colorways why its just perfect to wear as an under tankcami im a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders this is soft smooth and provides just enough coverage very flattering fit on its own as well great under loose knit or low cut sweaters love,1
9509,Im d this dress did nothing for me the seem on the side with the knot doesnt look right its almost on the side but not really theres a seem down the center of the butt from the waist it looks weird from the back because its such a fine striped print not flattering at all the dress is comfortable due to the stretchy knit and it has a stretchy knit lining hit me just a bit lower than on the model,0
9510,I ordered this item before seeing the july th review i ordered in a s and need an xs now the xs is sold out unfortunately my waist measures hips and i am the material very nice has elastic for movement and comfort i would wear this all the time if i had the correct size it would be cute dressed down or up,1
9511,An impulse try on that was immediately moved into the yes im buying right now pile the tunic is so soft i have worn as a shirt dress with booties and knee bootsknee socks the fabric while not the most forgiving if you buy this tight is so soft and cozy i am lbs c and the small hands nice and loose all around the body when this goes on sale i am buying more colors,1
9512,Bought this dress online in my usual p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress surprisingly they had p as well so i reordered that one and love it keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the,1
9513,I love this dress its so flattering and the length is perfect for me now that above the knee dresses are no longer flattering,1
9514,When i saw this blouse online i thought it was so cute i love the floral detail unfortunately it looks much cuter online than it does in person it has no shape so it is not flattering to the figure it might look better tucked in or partially tucked in as shown in the picture but it did not look good completely tucked out i was also not a fan of the fabric in the picture the fabric looks dressier than it is the front is more polyester and is a little dressier but not what i envisioned t,0
9515,Its hard to tell how jeans will fit when shopping online i was very pleasantly surprised they are super soft very high quality and look even better in person im lbs and i ordered the p and may have to get them taken up an inch but they fit perfectly through the hips and come in at the knee im big in the hips and small in the waist and they fit perfectly highly recommend for petites out there,1
9516,Just buy these i bought the olive green color and loved them so i bought the navy blue they fit true to size im a size and bought the they are comfortable and make your bum look good i prefer skirts dresses and shorter pants like these gauchos instead of shorty shorts during the summer and these will be something i wear all the time in warm weather you can wear them casually or dress them up,1
9517,I saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream i have worn it every chance i get it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans the length is perfect the design is flattering and the material is soft and comfortable the sleeves are snug but i like this feature especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse this will be a go to item thanks retailer another gem,1
9518,I received so many compliments on these pants these are not only classic they fit amazinglook great with heels andor booties match both black and brown,1
9519,I love these jeans but be advised that they run a little small in the waist they work for me but i think theyd work best on those with an hourglass shape im and about lbs with a small waist and i wear a in these but i have hips the fits perfectly since it has a small waist but accommodates my hips i love these jeans great fit good fabric great price,1
9520,I was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round it is absolutely stunning flattering comfortable and unique i am and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has,1
9521,I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color these are less flattering and i may not keep them,0
9522,I saw this dress in the store loved the print so much i had to try it on i definitely do not own anything like this i tried on a m i agree that it runs large on my petite hourglass frame it was a bit overwhelming however i was prepared for that paired it with a brown belt absolutely loved it the belt made the dress a little shorter definitely accentuated my curves in a good way such a beautiful casual dress that is actually comfortable i cant wait to wear it with tights with,1
9523,Ok so who likes to buy bathing suits apparently i do because this one arrived today in the white and rust and im buying the black one in a second i cant pass up such a flattering suit the ruched bottom gives just enough extra so its not skin tight to your bottom and the top has just the right amount of cover the whole suit is easy to wear nicely made and flattering through the roof,1
9524,These are great pants i love the fit and the taper of the leg these will be my go to black pants for the fall season,1
9525,This top wasnt an eye catcher off the bat but i love nothing more than a dressed up tee so its why it made it to the dressing room with me it has elbow length sleeves a slub texture super soft awesome texture and detail the slight vneck is perfect and the overall fit is great im typically a lover of black but the wine color was gorgeous too so i took both into the fitting room with me the other colors werent available surprisingly the black was not even close to a favorite but t,1
9526,I was surprised by the other reviews expected to live in this all winter but found the style bulky and awkward the hilow cut with so much bulk just wasnt flattering i wish the armholes had been larger so that the body of the shirt would have fallen closer to my body the armholes are the size of a fitted shirt which pulls the shirt wide rather than allowing it to drape a bit more it is incredibly soft but just not as comfortable as id hoped it went back,0
9527,I bought this originally for my daughter but fell in love with it when i tried it on and kept it for myself it is a cottonpolyester blend so it is very comfortable to wear the length fits nice as well i have received so many compliments wearing it with dress pants and also with jeans thank you for making an item that is both pretty flexible and meets the needs of young women and their moms,1
9528,The top fits nice but after one wear didnt even washed it the fabric was all fuzzy would not recommend it,0
9529,I love this suit the bottoms ran a bit too big on me im usually a small but an extra small would have fit more comfortably the small wasnt huge so i kept with them and im still very happy with this purchase,1
9530,Love the color cedar love the style sleeves are long and wide but that is the style biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped the length given in the product info is very short but when i received my normal size l the sweater comes to my hips just right the fibers are manmade acrylic so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s,1
9531,Love this shirt got it in white and it will be perfect for spring very flattering fit,1
9532,This is even nicer in person than it is online i absolutely love it i am and lbs and ordered my usual size small i probably could have worn an extra small but dont feel like the small is too big this could be my favorite purchase of the season,1
9533,This blouse is so pretty i love the neck tie which gives it interest and wont look boring on its own ill wear this allyear round i ordered an xxs which fits perfect,1
9534,Love it love the color fabric and buttons really comfortable relaxed fit,1
9535,The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over ones head it contains wool but is not in the least itchy in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric it would be cute with a patterned bottom like a plaid or dotted pants as shown doesnt seem to be easy to snag,1
9536,Did not work for me material was a bit thin poor quality the tie doesnt quite work correctly had a cheaper look to it not the quality id normally expect this is going back,0
9537,I loved this purchase the dress is beautiful its classy very feminine and richlooking the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture it is tailored and nonstretch so size has to be right i am between and and my size m dress fits well had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one gorgeous dress,1
9538,I took a leap and ordered this top in both colors my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a h i knew i needed then to run on the larger side i love both colorways equally but that said the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse the fit and fabric even feel different the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei,1
9539,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides it is terribly quality and gets worse with every wear and wash possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item ive ever seen like the design and fit immediately relegated it to a weekendhome shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so cant be shaved off,0
9540,I have somewhat sensitive skin and this fabric is awful in addition to it having no give feeling like it will stretch out and being slightly seethrough it is super scratchy it has little bits of what look to be tree material in the fabric awful,0
9541,Fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and ordered it right away however i was sadly disappointed once it arrived while the cut is cute the fabric is just all wrong i was expecting a nice heavy knitlike material but this feels and looks really cheap especially given the price of the dress sadly it is going back,0
9542,I have these shirts in the blue and green and they were great im c chest and athletic build the small shirts fit pretty good and i love the fabric so i kept them i really wanted these dresses to work but the cut was different even between the gray and burgundy there was tons of room in the chest but it was tight in the shoulders i really wanted to love this but theres just too many cut issues it is a good length for work though,0
9543,Cant wait for the weather to cool so i can wear this the split back makes it very flattering the green is definitely more brown,1
9544,These pants are the perfect weight and comfort they are cozy enough to wear around the house and sleep in as well i highly recommend these dreamy pants,1
9545,I love this jacket i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting it fits tts i am typically an xl and i ordered that size i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me the pictures on the website dont do it justice it looks much nicer in person,1
9546,I love to shop at retailer for tops that i can wear everyday they always seem to have pieces that are comfortable casual and quite different from what you would find in most stores this top is exactly that it fits true to size and is washable all you need are jeans boots and a neutral necklace and you are good to go you cant go wrong if you purchase this top,1
9547,This dress is gorgeous i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect it is light flowy and comfortable but the details make it special the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love the quality seems to be extremely high as well if you are looking for a white dress that is casual but still unique and beautiful please give this one a shot i cannot wait to wear it on my special day,1
9548,I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy i bought my usual xs b lbs and whilst it is looser on me than the model i would still say that it is tts maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like but i will wear mine partially tu,1
9549,I dont usually write reviews but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white it gives the appearance of a separate crop top i would usually wear a small and lbs im wearing a small in the photo but ended up going back for an xs the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf or dressier with heels and jewelry i think ill get a lot of use out of it,1
9550,Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i cant wait to wear it it is a perfect springsummer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt so if youre ok with this look you will love this shirt i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable a great addition to my wardrobe,1
9551,This sweater is light gray as shown in the photo not dark gray as the description states i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl,1
9552,Oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit i am so glad that i bought it it is beautiful and fits perfectly classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color the design is slimming as wellthere is nothing that i would change about it i may be wearing this for my th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future i love it,1
9553,The dress is true to fit and very soft you can dress it up or be casual with a denim jacket,1
9554,This skirt is worth every penny it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color it is a creamblue gray making it very versatile the crochet work is beautiful and cream it is not too bright to show every dirt mark the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color it is a classic elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come for me it is tts mostly i am usually a and the six fits perfectly it has an,1
9555,I was so excited to buy this coat since i missed out on buying the last one i snagged it quickly before heading out on a trip because this is the perfect plane jacket ive borrowed my friends i immediately noticed that the fabric was lighter and softer than the original and after a few days noticed a lot of pilling on the coat and a snag on the seam of the shoulder where the arm connects to the body its disappointing considering the price you pay i would return if it still had tags on,0
9556,im tall lbs and and the size s fit me perfectly i love the hyphen chinos and these fit almost the same just a bit trimmer they are not tight and just skim my body perfectly i love all the colors the red is darker than the two hyphen pinks the pants are comfy enough to be really casual and dressy enough to wear to work,1
9557,I got the honey colored and love the color they are very comfy and soft i look forward to wearing them all summer,1
9558,I bought this for my girlfriend with the hope that my presumptive intuition about her style preferences and the fit itself would prove successful fortunately she loves it and looks amazing in itthe colors are vibrant and the unique texture really lends itself toward a clothing item that is special even for retailerrecommend it highly,1
9559,I love the unique style of this dress the bell sleeves and the rather fitted body that poofs out at the end put the focus on these details as for fit im a standard xs petite and the xsp fits to a tee,1
9560,Im a rather small person about lbs a bust i typically take a ppxxs knowing how retailers sizing is a bit all over the place i ordered this tee in both xxs and xs planning to return the size that was less preferred imagine my surprise when i try on one of the tees and i barely can get it on imagine my further surprise when i realize that the xs is the tee that was so clingy now i realize that this is supposed to be a bodyskimming tee but even as petite as i am i coul,0
9561,I love this top i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when its warm it is delicate however so i try not to wash it too frequently the front is a bit boxy which the model demonstrates the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt the flow of it and the length,1
9562,Love this coat it fits very well im and typically wear an it is a bit broad in the shoulders like the other reviewers mention but thats part of its tailored look this gorgeous coat breaks up any boring winter outfit so happy with this purchase,1
9563,This skirt is so beautiful its a bit small but only a tad i can still wear it and it encourages me to lose lbs haha i get compliments everywhere i go,1
9564,I loved this jacket the minute i saw it saturday sunday is one of my favorite brands even cuter on than the photo short back at natural waist long in front great quality fabric thick and warm fits very narrow in sleeves so i went from small to medium to have room for a top underneath the medium is perfect back is stylish solid tweed grey with front pattern wrapped around from front sleeves and collar a black diamond pattern and ribbon trimmed edgeoverall very interesting grey black c,1
9565,This is such a unique piece and could be dressed up or down i can see myself wearing this with skinny jeans and a tee and adding a statement necklace or wearing over a dress i tend to get hot so i like how light weight this is even though it is lined it is of excellent quality but may run slightly small or at least smaller than other items i have purchased through retailer the drape is extremely flattering and i think that would be true for every figure my favorite feature is the oversized,1
9566,I am and the arms of this sweater run at least inches past my finger tips if the arms were not quite so rediculously long then i would definitely keep it but unless you are tall it just doesnt work also i felt the length of the waste was a little shorter than what is pictured online sigh,0
9567,Saw this online my size out xss p online did have xs checked store saw how great the dress looked at store able to try on only one avail at store m ordered xs online fits well with ada belt and cardigan until straps altered will keep cardigan onvery comfortable and cute lots of compliments worn to work,1
9568,This top was a great purchase even though its a bit expensive love the colors and the fit,1
9569,I am so pleased with this midi dress ive already worn and laundered this dress multiple times and i cannot express how comfortable and cute this dress is to wear best of all the fabric is just substantial enough that there are no posterior lumps or panty lines that are visible and the vneck is just low enough to provide a subtle sexy dcolletage i love the length of this dress as i really dislike my knobby knees and this exposes enough leg from the sides and disguises the ugly knees for me,1
9570,This is so pretty and s like i tried on a return size and it really fit i am usually a zero so i was surprised the regular size fit me really well length was perfect pretty heavy and substantial though love the d effect lbs dd in waist,1
9571,Look carefully at the pics of the back if this style and the color suit you just go ahead and order this one it looks just like the pics and is light comfortable and true to size the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great however because the back is sheer from halfway down maybe not for work if you work in an office moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easypeasy i am c and ordered the regular s,1
9572,I absolutely love each this dress it is shimmery as others have said but the design looks so beautiful that way and i dont agree that it mages it look cheap love the neckline and the length is perfect unless youre a petite size i would snatch this one right up if it werent for the price point im hoping itll go to sale but its so beautiful it might be sold out by then the fabric seems delicate like he threads could come apart easily,1
9573,I love the overall design of the top the embroidery is very nice as well i would agree with the past reviews that it runs large i am between a small and medium so i ordered the small,1
9574,I bought this a little ago in the denim color it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white,1
9575,I ordered the orange in size xl the fit on me matches the model other than being a little shorter in lengththe quality is bad i ordered two of these sweaters and both arrived new in the packages with one having a small hole the knit is so thin as is the base material the arms are basically seethrough it doesnt offer any warmth because of the thinness i layered a longsleeved white tee underneath which helped the edge of the sleeves stretched out within an hour i also had two area,0
9576,This is such a fun pullover sweater im not much for sweaters so i thought this would be a neat alternative im between a small and medium so i went with the small due to the swing style it fit wonderfully im even happy with the length which completely covers my behind im i choose the gray and its a great neutral but now im contemplating going back for the red as well hopefully a promo will come along soon,1
9577,I love this shirt so much i bought it nearly full price with my birthday month discountget it i purchased the red and also like the blackwhite polka dots hangs beautifullyfeels heavenly and polished and fun at the same time i bought the medium am generallya medium,1
9578,I bought the red motiff in my usual size of xxs petite and it was huge at first i thought they had mistakenly sent the wrong size but this was sadly not the case the fit is definitely sacklike as other reviewers mentioned i had to return,0
9579,I love these jeans i came on here to see if they were here on sale and they are but alas not in my size i probably wear these three times per week to work going out with friends all over i got the gray and i would say the color on the site is true to how they look in person i bought mine in the store and i will say that ive been on the fence about whether theyre gray or purple but the site says gray if you want a true gray that is a more blueish gray then these are not it because,1
9580,These are so comfortable its like wearing jammies outside i love the pattern and you really cant be the comfort,1
9581,I am b lbs and the fit me perfectly it comes just above my knee so i could also have worn the petite and would have been fine if it was shorter too i rarely wear green but this shade is so pretty,1
9582,I like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel or just for everyday i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces i am not a fan of dry clean only items so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily it is a tad boxy but it actually works for me c lbs i can wear it with a c,1
9583,Unless you have the body of the model tall and very thin and wear a really small size dont even think about getting this dress its literally a heavy sack it hit right above my knee in the front and basically midcalf in the back the material is nice but its an awful shape,0
9584,The photo does not do this top justice the design of this peplum is very slimming and the colors are complimentary to any skin tone i usually wear a m but purchased the l based on other reviews it fits perfectly would highly recommend,1
9585,I wanted to like this top so so so so badly so badly in fact that after the first size didnt fit i ordered two other sizes to make sure xl l m none of them worked i really wanted to like this top the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just notat least on me the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing the beaded work is very beautiful but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos,0
9586,I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer said with one notable exception probably because she and i have very different figures i am able to wear the sweater fully snapped with the belt cinching my waist creating a peplum effect i wore this jacket to a party as a top over a black band aid skirt code for tightfitting and tastefully short with black semiopaque tights and black booties the look was classy but edgy having paired a delicate floral pattern and unusually feminine n,1
9587,Im not sure why its considered a blue motif i think its more on the black and cream side other than that this is a great silk top for warmer weather its lightweight and airy and youll probably want to wear a nude bra underneath looks great with jeans and heels for a fun night out as well as trousers for work im and almost lbs with a a bust and a small fit great,1
9588,This is one of those you can tell from the hanger that its not going to work too boxy too short and the girlish ruffle makes it look like an oversized childs shirt that got all messed up in the washing machine,0
9589,These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs fit is true to size i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed it did so im stoked,1
9590,This is adorable and unique ive tried shawls and ponchos before they usually swallow me up this sweater has that type of feel but isnt so much fabric goes with everything,1
9591,Cool color great feel to this sweater nice with jeans skirts etc very cozy to wear i just want to keep grabbing it every morning,1
9592,I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach coverup the waist does not have elastic or any structure the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open the fabric is nice quality but i am returning,0
9593,I adore this top the fit is amazing the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring i think it looks great with skinny jeans i am built small up top size m and the fit perfectly the buttons did not gape at all,1
9594,I am busty and have a difficult time wearing stripes because they are not that flattering the stripes on this top are narrow and the material is thin which makes this great to wear under a jacket if you want to dress it up i am feet tall and ordered both the regular small and the ps because i wasnt sure which sleeves would be best on me as far as the length goes if you want the sleeves to look like they do on the model order the petite if thats what you usually order you can also get,1
9595,I am so glad that wide leg pants are coming back i love this style so flattering the color on these blue is rich and unique and the fit is exactly what i was hoping for i wanted them loose and low waisted and they are perfect i am lbs and ordered petite the length listed at is spoton with flats no tailoring needed i previously ordered these in white in r they also are good but a little too loose and will need hemming def recommend and hope retailer keeps this st,1
9596,I have the marrakech vest from the summer and really liked the quality and fit of that so i ordered this one fit is very similar this one is made of a lightweight cotton and has a similar cut will be a great fall transitional jacket and looks great with lots of thingsmaxi skirts skinny jeans long tops with the hems peaking out etc i found it tts i got an xs and am lbs i dont plan to wear more than a thin top underneath but dont think i could fit a sweater under the sle,1
9597,Ordered this dress online and hoped for the best because there wasnt a size chart to reference im usually in between a size small and a medium i ordered the size small and it fit well for a more flowy look i would have gone with the mediumeverything about this dress is soft i love it even the ribbon is delicate soft and made of quality material the lining feels like heaven this dress goes to the floor on me im i was expecting it to be more mid ankle length but i sti,1
9598,This was a lovely skirt the colors are beautiful and the style is not too poofy like other ball skirtsit is very high waisted and at the length was similar to the model,1
9599,I at first only intended to try this jacket on and get a feel for the fit and style as ive been looking for springfall inbetween weather outerwear but i unexpectedly and maybe unfortunately for my bank account fell in love instantly the fabric is very soft and the cut is cute stylish and flattering the quality seems good and the fit is perfect i ordered an xs regular in the moss color,1
9600,This tank i am in love with the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe it works with skinny jeans culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles my gladiators summer booties and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the degree plus summers that we have here in texas the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not,1
9601,Im and lbs i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasnt too long i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses if youre less busty b cup or smaller a s petite will fit you perfectly snug but not tight i love that i could dress it up for a party or down for work i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath,1
9602,I love these jeans cant believe i never purchased them earlier im always a in paige and ag and this was no different i will say that i did fit into the so it could be that they run slightly large the fabric is amazing and the white is perfect love that it is not see through and fabric is substantialthe length for me at was at my ankle i loved them so much that i bought them in white and beigecream highly recommend,1
9603,This beautiful blue sweater was exactly what i wanted,1
9604,This came in the mail today i wasnt sure of my size so i ordered a s m i tried on the small first and it fit perfect i never tried on the medium fyi im lbs a in the chest this jacket is a keeperit is so soft comfortable on i love olive as it goes with everything it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what youre wearing i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf i will use this jacket a lot,1
9605,I loved them on when i got them but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them and i had them on no more than times it was not a fit issue or a seam issue they literally just frayed apart in two areas while flattering and incredibly comfortable the fabric was not at all durablethey are not your typical denim they almost kind of a knit feel them,0
9606,I loved this top on the mannequin so i had to try it on i am a c and normally wear an i tried on the medium and it fit great i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier but you can always take to a tailor to have them removedi just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look ive already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well,1
9607,This is such a cute top ive learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big in a sloppy way i ordered the xxs and lbs and it fits well itll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans i definitely recommend,1
9608,Ordered a l and xl the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt both sizes had to be returned,0
9609,Awesome flares and very flattering a wardrobe staple,1
9610,These run very small they are also short almost like a crop pant the fit was so weird that i wont even exchange for a bigger size,0
9611,I would have never purchased this jacket based on the photo displayed here it looks like something my grandma would wear in person however this jacket is so versatile the fabric moves with your bodyand the ties at the bottom in the back and inside at the waist can be cinched to give it the look you want i purchased this to wear with the weekend widelegs which i also adore and its absolutely perfect color goes with everything ill wear it with boyfriend jeans in the fall too great,1
9612,I have wanted this dress since i first tried it on in april finally got it as a birthday gift and after looking at it closely there was makeup on the collar i checked the instructions and it says cold water wash so i washed only the collar part by hand and every part that got water on it bled looks like the popsicles are melting im so sad because this dress is adorable im buying another in hopes retailer will make this right by taking back the first one should be dry clean only,0
9613,It is a little roomy so if youre between sizes go with the smaller i think its flattering even if you have a larger chest love the details and the fabric is a good weight and quality,1
9614,I ordered this beautiful sweater skirt in petite because im too short for the asymmetrical hemline i love the geometric pattern on this skirt and the gold flecked waistband and the light sweater material make this a perfect skirt for my california fallwinter,1
9615,This is a great cardigan to wear buttoned or open the fit is perfect it is fitted and looks great with jeans skirts or over a sleeveless dress love the little detail of lace to show skin fabric has lycra so it hugs your bodice just enough love it,1
9616,I read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off i thought they were pretty dead on i absolutely love this jacket but do agree that its more of a sweatercoat than a heavy coat youd wear in the winter but i live in california so this will be just perfect for our winter i was afraid it might be too classic and uptight looking but its so fun the bell sleeves add some extra flair the overall coat has some stretch to it as well making it,1
9617,Got these in and they fit like a dream the best medium wash so versatile for all seasons i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch sometimes i wear or in paige i have a wide waist slim hips flat bumthese jeans help me look shapelier,1
9618,This is a rare review for me i usually love my retailer purchases even at times when other reviewers arent fans but this top is terrible b for reference small frame athletic bought the xs in black the length could have been longer but i could have lived with the length the arm hole area however a different story because its boxy and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape it did not fit snuggly,0
9619,This skirt is really beautiful and well made the color is a creamoff white like other reviewers mentioned it fits mostly true to sizei have a straight build with a wider stomach and no hips and my usual fit a tad tight in the waist but perfect in the hips i just love this skirt,1
9620,These corodorys are considered mid waist but i interpret them as the perfect height for the low waist or regular rise other than that they are beautiful so comfortable not stretchey yet not constricting im lb got a size and i need a belt in the waist but the butt and legs are perfect and the waist isnt too big just not constricting i always get urban outfitter corodorys but this year their quality is bad and these made of up it plus the length is perfect,1
9621,These are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style they look best rolled up for that casual chic look and can be dressed up or down these do run slightly large im and pounds and took the petite size i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out love these and really recommend them,1
9622,The malabar moto vest is made of a beautifully soft fabric and is lined on the inside the added details pockets and epaulets are a plus the vest has snaps and a zipper the length is just right and the vest has a flattering shape,1
9623,These are as comfortable as any other leggings they are thick enough that they are not see through such a pet peeve when i see people with see through leggings the front panel is so soft and i feel like it gives more of a professional vibe they are a bit croppedshort but im tall so im used to this,1
9624,I bought the bluegreen color it was absolutely beautifuli paired it with a green sweater jacket for inside and took the sweater off as it warmed up very comfortable versatile flexible and the color is rich i am and pds and the m fit perfect,1
9625,When i walked into the store this tee instantly caught my eye its light weight not too low cut and longer in the back great with jeans skirts or shorts,1
9626,Love this top,1
9627,Lovely colors and print my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely and worse the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread which showed through the sheer netting layer on top for the price this particular detail should have been addressed,0
9628,I feel like an indian goddess in this dress lots of swing to it,1
9629,I purchased this on sale it exceeded my expectations it is extremely soft and had a very unique construction and details i love it it does shed a bit but that does not bother me as the sweater is stunning ordered my typical size small no camisole is needed if worn with a nude bra,1
9630,I picked this up during the bf promo and very happy to find my size i was watching this coat i call this really a topper because it is not heavy and finishes an outfit i went up to a size because it runs slim as noted in the description and the reviews i find this piece to be a reminder of the old retailer pieces i have collected over the years since my chest is a dd and even then the is snug i cant wait to wear this bold statement piece i purchased the bailly navy p,1
9631,I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size i tried it on it fit so well the front wasnt too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well the fabric is silky but washable the top is very well made and fun to wear,1
9632,This dress got my attention in the store due to the bright color its like a tangerine orange that absolutely shouts summer loved the asymmetrical hem and another plus was the pockets they look completely hidden so the dress does fall flat i thought this ran a little big in the chest area which doesnt happen often a size worked for me cant wait to wear this,1
9633,I love this top it flows nicely and fits perfectly im lbs and ordered the small i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse too,1
9634,I chose the petite small for the shorter length fits perfectly it falls abt below my knees normally i am a small in tops waiting for some cooler weather to wear with some of my swing style turtlenecks i have jeans c looks pretty much on me as in the pic,1
9635,This top is beautiful online and in person i am in no way a large full figured gal but i did order an xl reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size this shirt is horribly tiny in person the xl regular fit looked like an xs have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what will take back other than fit the shirt is very beautiful in every way,0
9636,Very cute and comfortable dress run true to size i usually wear a and the s fits nicely stretchy and soft,1
9637,I used to walk by this dress thinking not much of it but one day i realized it had a bow which im a complete sucker for tried it on fell in love tried on the and went with the runs tts if the dress is too large the bow flips down and you can see too much gaping between your back and the dress somewhere between a shift and a sheath is this silhouette with my hair pinned up in a teased out japanese bun and great black heels my valentine date fell for this dress too he said it r,1
9638,I love the colorblock color combo the colors are neutral enough to go with so many things yet still be unique and stand out the fit was perfect i took my normal size medium,1
9639,Im an xl in retailer tops and the xl in this blouse fit wonderfully i bought the blouse in black but will also probably purchase it in the cream the blouse is made very nicely however i had to deal with about embroidered pieces that were not knotted i had to take a needle and thread the loose pieces to the back of the blouse and then knot them in with the rest of the embroidery some of the individual flowers just came out entirely however this is such a stunning blouse and i feel so g,1
9640,This material is a nice quality but the shirt is boxy and shapeless it was not flattering at all on my shape i dont think it would look nice on anyone with an hourglass shape or fuller chest,0
9641,This style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it however it is seriously overpriced i ordered the white and the material is thin and seethrough the small was even a bit roomy lbs dd going back unfortunately,0
9642,Like other reviewers found leg more flaredstraight than pictured i wore all day at work desk job and didnt see any wrinkling,1
9643,I like this top because it covers the bum it is a little longer in the back than front it is cotton modal soft and it is light enough for summer the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer but classier than a tank top i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility material for comfort and classical style,1
9644,I was surprised i was the st to review this t i got it on black friday loved the fit and look immediately i wear w skinny jeans and boots but also converse or many options and a good price,1
9645,I have to agree that the fit is unfortunate i am using a size in retailer and most dresses i knew to size up based on reviews here i tried the size and i could barely button the top the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body i sized up to a size and the dress was oversized in the top with gaping armholes too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable,0
9646,This sweater has a retro feel to it i like how it hits right at the hips and its not too long or not too short it keeps you warm and its a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter,1
9647,Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed these are the most flatering jeans they give you legs for days while providing amazing shape oh and did i mention their soft as butter huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body they are on the pricier side and well worth it,1
9648,I wasnt sure how this top would look on me but i just love it i am lbs and i ordered the petite small i may even been able to get away with petite xs i did not find this top too full long or tentlike at all i have a bust as well and it looks very flattering on me i wore it with denim shorts and it will look great with skinny jeans i would also wear it on the beach as a cover up very versatile i love the color and pattern on the top and really love the black lace on the bottom,1
9649,I was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter this shirt looks great on its own but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests etc its a little thin so i only gave it stars for quality but it is holding up well so far,1
9650,I love these pants i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels also i like you can wash instead of dry clean,1
9651,Nice quality not too thin like most white tops and the arms are cut just right perfect length too,1
9652,I ordered the xx petite on this one and unlike last years version of a similar sweater this one is a bit longer and looser last year i kept the xs p but it was shorter too the fit is loose not snug or formfitting even as the smallest size available it was loose but not large or unflattering the length was also appropriate love the colors and pattern too the material is soft and the button detail in the back is fun i am dd in waist lbs for reference,1
9653,Love this tshirt its comfortable and very cute it runs a little large i am pounds and got a xs the color is a little brighter than the picture,1
9654,The fit on this is so strange the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price the cups are padded which is nice i suppose but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup im guessing im a dd size in pants and size in dresses and i ordered a medium i also have a long torso which probably didnt help,0
9655,This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt its fun comfortable and has great style the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments im and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees i usually wear a size and the large fit great,1
9656,I just received these in the mail but had to send them back to the store because they are too big i usually wear a and sometimes even a in most ag and mother jeans the in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture i ordered size so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown,1
9657,I agree with the other reviewer this is classic retailer oldstyle quality the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloonfit of the waist i usually choose sm in cardigans for ref lbs b but even the small of this sweatercoat dwarfed me i think it just depends what you are looking for unique it is and certainly lovely,1
9658,I love this dress the fit is incredibly flattering and im currently carrying more weight than my normal size i selected a which is about a size larger than normal and it was a perfect fit i tried on a larger size for measure and the provided a perfect fit and flare ive worn the dress on three occasions already and each time friends remarked on their admiration for the dress itself and flattering style for me i have no issues at all with the cut and to me the bias a,1
9659,I love the tiger print its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit,1
9660,I like this top it provides a nice pop to the fallwinter dark wardrobe pieces the picture gives off a blue hue but the top is black kind of a dusty black the picture also gives the impression that the leaves are turquoise but theyre actually more green at any rate it is nice addition to my very dark winter wardrobe i cannot wait to wear it with white denim like the model and something in the green family i definitely recommend it,1
9661,The pictures of this dress are terrible compared to seeing it in person and i instantly fell in love with this dress when i put it on the fit is very flattering with a touch of s flare the colors are better in person too with the lightest color being pink not white as pictured,1
9662,This dress is lovely the embroidery is beautifully done and with bright colors the material is sturdy the fit is overall true to size but slightly small through the bust the length is several inches above my knees and i ordered the regular even though i am only the pockets are a bonus,1
9663,I ordered these online i usually wear a depending on the brand i ordered the and love the way they fit as i didnt want them tight they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality,1
9664,The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering very happy with this purchase i plan to buy a nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish,1
9665,Do not buy i used my discount on this what a waste my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand i should have gotten a small i dont think that wouldve helped it was so awkward looking nothing like the model it made me look as if i had gained pounds it was waaay longer in the backlike a mullet the material was really thick it is more appropriate for fall i had high hopes for thisto dress up or down it was just so ridiculous,0
9666,I ordered the top from a store to have it shipped it is very pretty but once on it fit the wrong way i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high,0
9667,Dress is silk its soft and pretty its blue so you can wear brown or blue suede bootsi caught my reflection a few times and thought i looked really bottom heavy dress is awesome worth it,1
9668,I saw the neutral motif in the theres only one left hanger in the store and tried it on its very pretty cute and sweet i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a babydoll look but thats just my preference i tried on size and its a bit tight in the chest area im b waist hips so i think size would fit very well despite the pretty flower design in my personal opinion i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric,1
9669,This dress has style and a delicate balance between design and the beauty of the material,1
9670,This sweater is so much better in person it is a heavy soft knit that fits perfectlyi am petite and thin and took the reg xs it is very flattering and drops just below the hips the bottom is a bit flowy i bought the beige and bright pink color the pink is very dark and bright and has an orangy tint to it i wear a dark beige cami underneath super cute with cuffed dark jeans and black booties,1
9671,This top is gorgeous and versatile i wear it with jeans and dress it up with a skirt so happy to have this in my wardrobe,1
9672,Again nope looks chic on the model looked like a floorlength flannel nightgown on me if youd put a bonnet on me and stuck a candlestick in my hand i could double for ebenezer scrooge in a christmas carol i believe the word i used to describe it when i tried it on was shmata yiddish for rags it looked like i was wearing a rag the ruching didnt do anything to flatter my figure the knit did not seem terribly warm for a sweater felt more like rayon or nylon jersey than a knit swe,0
9673,Tried this on and loved it chic lightweight warm cute left as is and cuter belted ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure,1
9674,I bought one size up in these fun cropped pants i am petite but wanted these to fit longer so i ordered a regular size they are perfect there is a nice patterned texture to these pants that is hard to see in the pictures they are worth the price,1
9675,If i could tell you how many compliments i got on with this coat i would end up writing a book this coat is beautiful fits like a glove i got the size went into the store to try it on to make sure it fit right and tried on both the and im typically a so i guess i went a size up this coat is striking and the colors are beautiful,1
9676,I ordered this because i cant resist denim shirts i love the unusual shape for a tank top and the fulllength bronze zipper in the back is to die for it looks great with everything,1
9677,I was worried at first that this dress might make me look like a circus tent but it is actually incredibly flattering also super comfy first day wearing if i got compliments from friends and strangers,1
9678,Noce color as well only gave one less star due to thin you could see my bra quality it was pink and i tried on the grey otherwise nice and soft regular size a little long and long sleeves but sold out n petite,1
9679,So glad i gave this a try looks so much better on than seeing it online i doubt i will ever wear it tied but its very cute and comfortable it will probably be my goto sweater to throw on over summer clothes when the ac is too cold it would even be great to throw on over workout clothes fits tts,1
9680,I wanted this top ever since i saw it online it is so me its a nice mix of feminine and masculine you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely i highly recommend this shirt i would get it before its gone,1
9681,This vest was a musthave the minute i saw it i usually stick to the sale section but this was a worthy exception i love the reversible option i bought the matching leggings as well and have worn them with the smaller floral motifso many compliments i teach barre so i figured i would wear this to and from the studio but i find myself reaching for it to go over all my regular clothes too the only draw back is the zipper im sure its because it is reversible however the zipper hasn,1
9682,I tried this on in the store and i couldnt keep it on my body for more then seconds its extremely itchy which is a pity because i do appreciate the design,0
9683,Perfect for summer nights makes any outfit that much special,1
9684,This dress is very comfortable the fabric is really nice and the dress flows when you move classic and pretty i ordered a xs and im lbs b and the fit was great,1
9685,Wore with leggings ballet flats compliments,1
9686,I love this top it does run big and maybe some wont like it with the elastic waist i think its the perfect weight and very comfortable i love the detail around the neck line,1
9687,I absolutely love this dress beautiful flattering shape with flowing light weight fabric im so in love with this color a great dress for a special night,1
9688,The design is very flattering and holiday appropriate but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used although figure flattering the zipper is so cheap that it runs along the left side it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress and the rough cheap poly is not worth what theyre asking for it maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail,0
9689,Pretty design but when i tried it on the fabric was thin and delicate i dont think it would last long with much wear too bad if the fabric were sturdier itd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets,0
9690,This is such a darling velvet dress understated yet eye catching i am very fond of it the cut is flattering to all and the gathered fabric does not add bulk to the waist there is a fun tulle underskirt to give just the right amount of volume the straps creep ever so slightly toward being off shoulder but fear not because there are loops and fasteners to hold your bra in placei am very thrilled to have found my holiday party dress so early and cant wait to wear it,1
9691,Purchased the blue motif colorway which as other reviewers mentioned is cream mushroom black heavier lines and very dark navy grid part looks good with both my cropped and dusterlength black cardigan print is a nice balance between neutral and interesting a lighter weight knit but still opaque and skims over versus clings to the bodythe fit is very flattering and forgiving the rushed midsection is cut higher and lower on the side seam to give a more hourglass line the scoop b,1
9692,These look nothing like the picture they are super highwaisted longer than they look in this picture i felt as if i was wearing a pair of jeans from the s that just fit terribly i thought they were going to be a pair of cropped wide legs they are far from it the color was also much lighter than shown in picture super unflattering just not for me theyre going back,0
9693,This dress is awesome i actually first saw it on lucy lui on elementary and thought it had to be from retailer sure enough it was and it was on sale i got the blue and would have gotten both if they had my size i am usually a m and found this fit true to size i always love a wrap dress and this with the buttons keeps it from spilling open love it,1
9694,This is a classic well made velvet top it fits true to size is very flattering the on line photos dont do it justice very pretty in real life a lbs ordered the xs,1
9695,Im so bummed i absolutely loved the pair of these i bought in the bronze color great fit great color so comfortable however i just washed them and could tell right away when i laid them flat to dry that they had lost color in areas where they had wrinkled in the wash machine so now they have strange lighter lines running along them not acceptable i will say that the two lighter colors may not have this issue for reference see my stats i bought a,0
9696,I really love this dress it hangs well and clings in all the right places i ordered this online and the store that sent it had left the security tag in i sent it back the tag was taken out and the dress returned very quickly and without cost to me,1
9697,I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge maybe if you size down it would be better xs was not available for me to try also the lavender color is really washed out,0
9698,This is a great dress i feel like it hides any imperfect spots including some armpit fat or belly fat i have gotten several compliments on this dress because the stitching for the flowers is very high quality,1
9699,I saw this at the store today very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through from what i could see on my body it would have been too short in the crotch i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely i gave up cute shade of green though,0
9700,I can wear this top with jeans or a business suit the cowl neck is the best part it gives this garment a little pop yesterday i combined it with a black business suit and white pearls i had so many compliments,1
9701,This is an adorable topper for all these ballgowns when you have no top that said it was a lot shorter on me than i expected i attribute this to the fact that i have a chest the fit is true to size but while not showing much tightness around the chest to any gape in the buttons in the back it became more of a crop top i have been needing a short topper so im definitely keeping this the back button detail is adorable the lace for me is soft and not stratchy or irritating but i only trie,1
9702,I love these pants they are comfortable and dressy enough for work the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional these are also nice and long for wearing heels i ordered a size and they fit great i normally wear a size in us sizing,1
9703,I ordered my usual size s in the purple print this peplum top style colorspattern will go easily with pretty much anything shorts pants jeans skirts wear for casual or dress it up for me the fit is tts armholes provide good coverage length is fine the top has a bit of stretch doesnt feel restrictive the waist is banded a little loose which is fine dont like tight fitting waists on tops i like that the waist seems a little lower than other peplum tops at retailer the skirt,1
9704,This dress is a beauty i am and plan to wear this as a tunic over leggings or straight leg pants the embroidery is really pretty even though it does run a bit big i would have liked a size or less but it was completely sold out except for a size it is so nice with gorgeous high quality denim that i will make the best of it may need to get some tailoring but in my mind this dress is so worth it,1
9705,Easy to wear the fabric is super soft and the shape is very flattering i really like the shirt hem at the bottom,1
9706,I tried the neutral motif one on when it first came out i didnt buy but it stayed on my mind bc the colors were so pretty i got it at sale on sale and am so happy i did it is sheer but i think it would work fine in a casual setting without a tank as long as you have a skin tone bra great buy and tts,1
9707,Disappointed this top has a boxy shape and looked like a mini moo moo on me i have a similar shape as the model and it looked nothing like that on me bummer i liked the quality and weight not too heavy nor too light but shape is unflattering its going back,0
9708,Dont even waste your money even on salebought three in different colors because i loved the loose fit and airyness for hot southern summers unfortunately one of them ripped in the first wash i let it air dry and thats when i found multiple runs and a hole that i could put my finger through one of the other colors was fine yet still pilled pretty bad the third one still has the tag keeping the one that survived the wash because i like the color but will only be using it as a knock,0
9709,This sweater works on many levels for petite frames the length is just right hitting at the lower waist the design is very pretty feminine and with flair,1
9710,I love these laid back causal pants they have a draw string very comfortable and can be an alternative to sweat pants lounge wear etc i am petite lbs or a little less and i got the xsmal size i am pretty proportioned but my upper body is a little thinner meaning i dont have a straight rail body my petite frame has curve to my hips tush so it isnt easy to find pants jeans etc that are automatically flattering these trousers are cut well of good quality and nice n,1
9711,Dont detach the collar unless you like getting frustrated i made the mistake of taking it off just to see what it looks like without it cute but reattaching was the biggest pain i have pretty nimble fingers but stretching the little loops around the little buttons tested my patience to the limit so other than thatbuy this sweater if you get a chance its stylish flattering soft versatile etc etc,1
9712,I have received so many compliments its my favorite,1
9713,I really like the red version of this shirt it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace for the weekend i am lbs a d chest and the small fit me perfectly,1
9714,Perfect light weght sweater for the holidays i love the detail in the back the xs was a great fit for this lb body,1
9715,I bought the here comes the sun version of this shirt i had to have it im a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer she said that you no longer counts the years of her life instead she counts her sunny days i was inspired to do the same so i love this shirt i got it on sale but it still couldve been cheaper,1
9716,Love this i sized up to xl from large great pattern very soft i am thick legged and big booty this romper is the perfect length the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom hard to unzip from the back in a hurry i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down,1
9717,It is soft and hangs great problem i wore it one time and the back balled up terrible it looked like i had owned it for years not worn it one time wouldnt recommend though it is sooooo soft,0
9718,I saw this top online and fell in love with the overall casual looki ordered all colors and they just arrivedlove love love they are soft comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fitthe understated ruffled details add the special something that is so retailerthey are sophisticated yet prettythe orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shadethe plumpurple is a rich unique and pretty colorthe navy is a perfect denim colora fantastic basic,1
9719,This shirt is awesome i absolutely love the style of this shirt its super flowy and is a really breathable fabric ive been wearing this shirt a lot lately with printed pants the only downside is the quality of material it kind of feels like this shirt could have been made myself with a plain t shirt and some basic sewing skills it also feels like its going to start falling apart at the arm seams nonetheless i adore the shirt and will be getting a lot of use out of it this season no,1
9720,This is such a classy elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice i love how it doesnt slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome such a fun and practical extra i thought the arms were a little tricky but you would see the same issue with any cape style top the gray is a nice color but i wish it came in another option a wine color would be amazing,1
9721,I love these shorts they are cuter in person than online they fit perfectlycasual somewhat loose airy feeling i am lbs took my usual size i wear shorts a little lower on my waist and i prefer the looser fit if you plan to wear them up higher on your waist you can probably size down but i didnt want to worry about shrinkage and i wanted them to be easy and comfy they washed nicely machine wash cold laid flat light iron touch up i ordered in moss green nice color,1
9722,This dress is really sweet and flows well i love the fabric and the colors are soft this dress is perfect for hot summ days and is so comfortable you could dress it up with fun sandals or simple wear flip flops i love how the seam around the bodice drops lower in the back its very flattering i bought a small,1
9723,This is a great piece it fits really well and the fabric is nice and soft it is a good thickness so you dont have to wear a shirt underneath,1
9724,This bra is the one i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra and this is it if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps a vneck cut none of that scoop cut nonsense and you dont care about trying to boost your cleavage this bra has it all so comfy too,1
9725,The shirt fits very nicely a little large but very confortable amazing color i got it in green,1
9726,This sweater has instantly become a favorite it is incredibly soft the detailing is delicate and feminine and the fit is cozy and flattering the body has a definitive swing cut while the arms are slim though not tight i find the loose body slim arm combination to be very flattering and forgiving run out and buy this now if you love anywhere where it gets cold foggy or dark its a guaranteed goto,1
9727,I purchased this sweater in black to dress up my everyday cardigan this is very soft and can dress up a skirt or great with jeans,1
9728,This shirt is beautifulits very light weight and great summer tee dont hesitate to buy this you wont be disappointedi usually dont buy tshirts that are quite this pricey but i knew it might not last till it went on saleruns a bit large and since it is linen it will likely stretch a biti have not worn it yet,1
9729,This is a great casual top for spring i loved the covered buttons in the back and the longer back peplum too the peplum in the front covers the top of pants i am tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough so the length sleeves are perfect the fabric is light weight but not sheer and the embroidered dots are well done,1
9730,The linen cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus for vertically challenged girls like me wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs now that theyre on sale im snatching up other colors like white and light khaki already have the seersucker blue pair,1
9731,My yearold daughter fell in love with this when we saw it in the store at the beginning of the summer but it was much much too expensive when i saw it on sale at the end of the summer i jumped on it she loves it,1
9732,Im in love with this top i usually wear a sm or and the size fits perfectly the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down and when theyre down they hit right at the wrist not too long or short its lightweight and comfy but looks really pulled together i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer a great transitional piecei only wish this came in solid white o,1
9733,Another reviewer said it best i love the way this dress makes me feel i couldnt agree more the lines are perfect and effortless with all the different reviews on size i went into the store to try it on i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress i am and have a small bust,1
9734,I love this sweater ive gotten compliments on it every time ive worn it i have the moth color and it is oh so cozy yet not too big or too heavy i pair it with black leggings black booties and a crimsoncolored scarf its nice as it can be great for daytoevening getting the other two colors asap the medium fits me perfectly,1
9735,I ordered xs petite which they are sold out of but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review im feet tall and lbs i am d so busty the petite did not overwhelm me the pockets do open youre supposed to cut the little threads out ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help i like that there is a little stiffness to the cape it has holes for your arms not a poncho your lucky if they have your size,1
9736,Beautiful print however as the previous reviewer mentioned it is very sheer much sheerer than the product shot shows i was expecting to be able to wear a nude bra under this without a cami however my nude bra was completely visiblethe top also ended at the middle of the zipper of my jeans so much shorter than the tunic length shown and the bottom half of the sleeves ballooned out much more noticeably in person the top half of the sleeves are slim and the bottom half are looserover,0
9737,I tried this dress on in store and i realized it is true to size in every way i am and needed a petite for it to land just above my knee this dress was elegant i wore it to a wedding and some thought it was a rent the runway dress ha im way to classy for that for all you ladies who want to look sophisticated in those cooler evening events this is your dress i felt so elegant and danced the night away and had no issues the clasps go all the way down the dress so i do suggest li,1
9738,Fits a bit on the bigger side but also being the style of the top i would order down a bit im usually a on top c and the xs was perfect the wine color is classy its a timeless piece,1
9739,I discovered seea bathing suits last year and fell in love i currently own two the hermosa surf suit and the seea zuma for reference i am pounds c waist dress size pants jeans if you have questions about sizing there is a great reference on seeas website on how to size if you are taller than the reference sizing they provide but still the same measurements as another size mentioned they suggest sizing up as the suits are typically made for surfingpadd,1
9740,Wore it to an interview the color is fantastic its beautiful and artsy highly recommend,1
9741,I absolutely love this blouse it is so soft easy to wear and can be worn with so many things im pounds and got a small regular i couldve gone for the petite but decided to do regular love it,1
9742,This jacket is a show stopper great fabric beautiful embroidery well worth the price,1
9743,This dress was exactly what i wanted great material cute pale blue slip lining the dress i ordered a medium and it was perfect i am about and about i received compliments all day on how cute it was,1
9744,Just recently purchased and think its ok for the price would never pay full on this one thats from an retailer shopper whos purchased plenty at full price design is cute but definitely looks like a sleep shirt esp in the lighter color soso on construction the bottom seams pucker slightly the pockets bunch up weirdly steaminglaundering dont help the shoulders also hunch up oddly could be because of the thicker fabric sewn to the knit but laundering didnt help that issue either,0
9745,This robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model usually things look better on the models but not this one i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes thank you retailer this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly without being too heavy the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed,1
9746,This is a great blouse the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer i am long waisted and lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans it would also be swell with a pencil skirt it will cover any fashion flaws i usually like to shop the s,1
9747,I never noticed this sweater online but when i saw it in the store it was love at first sight i agree with other reviewers that the color description is odd the brown is a very pale gray and the blue is a light mint green the sweater is very delicate looking and fits true to size the sleeves are very long covering my hands and i have long arms it does have enough body to make a large roll at the cuff i do have a couple of issues that arent related specifically to this sweater even tho,1
9748,I waited a long time to get this top unfortunately i will be returning the sides are gathered and stick out a lot on the sides not as pictured the sides should have been pleated it runs smaller in the bust and when closed it was a little snug afraid this might shrink with dry cleaning or washing the design is unique and wish this top would of worked,0
9749,I love these jeans the fabric is super super soft with good stretch and give however they dont loose their shape either they are midrise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over my only complaint and this is just personal preference is that the back pockets are kind of small but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have for reference i am and wear size comfy gotos,1
9750,The red of the cape is a deep garnet really pretty with the beige lining its loose enough that it feels and flows differently than a sweater the boiled wool isnt itchy but keeps you warm on a fall day the one snap lets you easily take it on and off im and lbs the xs fit perfectly without being too tight ive gotten a lot of compliments on it,1
9751,Let me start by saying i am incredibly picky about pants i hate probably of the pants i try on pilcro is the consistent exception and these are probably my favorites of all my pilcros perhaps tied with the cords runs true to pilcro size which i find to be a bit largemost of my other pants are a and a is quite comfortable in these despite being leggings theyre thickstructured enough to wear to work,1
9752,The arm holes are a little large but not to a point i can not deal with them it hits just at the right place on my body and is very flattering i love the print and it is going to be a staple with jackets and alone,1
9753,Great fit runs maybe a tad big but overall great fitquality,1
9754,I bought in the store i usually order large petite but i was in the store which doesnt have petites so i tried a large and it was tight in the bust but i loved the shape i ended up buying xls and taking them up at the shoulders to make it a petite fit gives me a small looking waistline,1
9755,I loved the design and light weight quality reference im i ordered a small its a tad big but i can handle it because of the neck line you must wear a strapless bra,1
9756,Although the material of this top is beautiful and the quality is nice as well it really did not lay right on me im a d and i got my usual size in a small the arm holes were a bit too big the waist was too wide and it overall looked like a bib on me,0
9757,I thought this dress would make me look washed out but absolutely doesntbeautiful pop of color and unique design ive received many complements this one is a keeper,1
9758,I absolutely love this top it is soft comfortable and perfectly flowy this is definitely my favorite go to casual summer top,1
9759,This could worn with anything tank top long sleeves gloves jeans and pants very high quality material will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall,1
9760,I really wanted to love this shirt the colors are gorgeous very vibrant and just as shown the fit was all wrong on me i ordered the petite xxs and it was still too boxy and it kept shifting so the front collar of the shirt would ride up into my neck it looked like a sack on me for reference i am lbswith a small frame,0
9761,I loved this dress as pictured online and when i received it i fell in love with the look as well as the fit it is such a perfect dress for the day or night i am so happy i ordered it,1
9762,Gorgeous dress perfect for something special paired with black heels runs a touch large i normally wear a small and pounds but im expecting so i sized up to a medium and its very roomy the sleeves do cap out a little too much but its just so pretty i dont care def a keeper,1
9763,I love this sweater i bought the grey and the neutral one it is very soft has great color combos and seems to have minimal pulling even though its lightweight it keeps me warm,1
9764,This is an awesome vest so soft cozy and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did ill mention the one flawno pockets still totally worth full price in my mind though,1
9765,Just bought this top in the black at my local retailer and i love it it fits well not too large and tenty it actually fit me under the arms too usually retailer tops tend to run huge not this one i love that it is easy to layer with a long boyfriend cardi or a more structured jacket im pounds and took the xs i would definitely recommend this top,1
9766,This is a beautifully made jacket i ended up buying the cream color as the yellow had sold out the cream goes with everything so that was probably the right decision the inside of the jacket has a silk lining with a scotty dog pattern the jacket fabric has just the right weight to hang properly without being too heavy,1
9767,Love this poncho plan to take it to europe this fall warm and cozy yet not constricting great neutral color,1
9768,I love this dress it has a beautiful european flair and more beautiful in person i dont agree with the other reviewers that its see throughthe fabric is a good quality and thicker than you would think the variable length is the best part of the dress the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow,1
9769,I thought these were pretty on the website but in person they look like a work of art the colors are vivid bright reds pinks greens blues yellow with flora fauna houses writing type and so many other things on a white and cream background they are very soft mediumweight flannel for me they run true to size i wish they had pockets though,1
9770,The fabric is too sheer also looks like sleepwear just not my thing,0
9771,This was a rare fullprice purchase for me i do think that it runs slightly large but that is part of the look of this dress i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist but they didnt have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering but i also think it will transition well with tights boots and a cardigan when temps start cooling off,1
9772,This is my favorite kind of neckline it is very flattering cool for summer my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it its super cute will be great for vacationing next summer,1
9773,I would have loved this top if it were the length pictured on the model but it was a cropped length on me,0
9774,Ive been wanting to try the cropped pleated pants style and i like these the material is nice comfortable and the bow adds whimsy compared to other brands ive tried these pants fit the best the waistband goes up higher in the back so theres no gapping a big plus for me just one thing i find cartonnier to run small so i would suggest ordering one size bigger,1
9775,This top is gorgeous this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing i just love how unique this top is its a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves im a ddd i ordered the large and its perfect it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways its a must buy,1
9776,This is a pretty tunic but it just didnt look right on me the colors are nice and you can easily hide body flaws,1
9777,The quality of this sweater is excellent it is well work the money i am d and purchased a medium fits perfectly for a fitted look and hits right at my natural waistline,1
9778,Love boys and arrows make amazing suits i wear a in jeans and a size small in this bikini bottom it actually fits true to size which seems impossible in swimwear cheeky for sure but so cute fabric is super super soft i want to wear these all day long,1
9779,I fell in love with this top in the store and ordered another online it is very soft and comfortable the petite tend to run a little short in the front but the regular is perfect its oversized without being frumpy or boxy on my petite frame,1
9780,Absolutely love everything about this dress im lbs purchased a small hits just slightly above the knee has a fun flow to it absolutely love the chest detail cute buttons and the embroidered detail is amazing,1
9781,Love love love this dress the color is a beautiful blue grey and the peach embroidery has just a tiny bit of sparkle can be dressed up or down,1
9782,When i got this skirt i figured it was a muted sweater skirt what i got was a much fancier sparkly sweater skirt the blue is more of a bright sparkly teal and gold thread is woven throughout oh my its spectacular really beautiful,1
9783,I liked the understated colors of this dress so i decided to try it on i did not expect it to fit so well im with a large bust and large hips the dress was super slimming and flattering it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me the only thing id have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long but im used to that with my height the straps are positioned perfectly my bra straps didnt even show the material is very thin and light,1
9784,I love these they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe and just like all other pilcro jeans they are a great fit and true to size,1
9785,This is a beautiful blouse great colors and detailing i absolutely love the design in the back will look great with white skinny jeans it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works i waffled between the and am usually an and a full b cup in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast so i was considering the but ultimately decided the did so with a bit more comf,1
9786,I saw this in the rockefeller store and picked it right up i dont wear red so this shade or burgundy was more my color the fit is perfect sometimes buy a m at retailer but the small was perfect which is what id wear at in most brands i was slightly shocked it cost more than the other tops i bought but it was too pretty to put back wore with dark flare jeans to dinner that very night,1
9787,Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending i am dd and usually a sp i tried on a regular s and xs in the store and the s was huge i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the off sale hit because i liked the extra length great bra coverageit is not too long at the armholes or too low in the back i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesnt have quite so much decolletage but it is wearable as is this is much more of a ro,1
9788,This is a simple lightweight tunic top the construction is fine overall im happy to see a basic executed well,1
9789,I purchased this top in the oatmealbeige color i love it the material is very soft and it fits true to size i would have purchased the black color too if it was still available,1
9790,Way too big and had a granny like styling was very excited but ultimately took it back,0
9791,Ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick,1
9792,This sweater i bought to go with a navy dress it is not ivory it is sortof a blush color not at all what i had in mind the sweater itself is pretty the back is shorter as someone else described which looks slightly awkward when wearing it definite return,0
9793,I live abroad where there is no retailer so i rely heavily on reviewsi took the advice from others and ordered a size up glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you luckily for meit fits wonderfullyi love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets its linedbut not too bulkyits a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin,1
9794,I bought this on sale and at the sale price it is a steal great style feel and fit maybe wouldnt feel as good about it at full price but wish i had one is every color,1
9795,Great top super cute runs a little big i usually purchase l but the m fit better its thin but not see through so it lays well,1
9796,I find these to be nearly perfect the quality is ideasoft yet sturdy the stitching is unique based on the colorwhich i love and while theyre super machinewashable i never need to iron them for a businesscasual look i tend to like things on the baggy side so as a gal with about pounds on me i wear a but im sure a fitted look would be more appealing to most that said i often get larger because theyre a tiny bit shorter than i like so i wear them kinda low and if i,1
9797,It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while i wasnt sure about the color then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers which i had just purchased and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it i love the fit and feel of this top i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice my only wish is that t was a touch longer,1
9798,I bought this dress in a sm for a cruise im taking soon i dont have much of a waist kind of straight like a board and this dress is very flattering on my figure the skirt fits snug and the top drapes nicely over my waist very pretty and flowy i bought the multi color stripe dress and the vertical stripes enhance the beauty of the dress,1
9799,I loved this but hesitated to order since im petite and busty and assumed it would be an awful mess in the chest area too tight gaping etc but it is great it fits perfectly there is plenty of room in the chest and the dress is not too long i ordered a pm and its wonderful the dress is not see through at all love it,1
9800,This dress is even better in person the base color of the fabric is a very light peach and very lovely as you can see from the photos the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress but i found the front on mine was very similar to the st photo the bright green flowers are a light mint green which plays beautifully with the light peach there are more details in the print to discover in person which is a nice bonus the silk is not stiff li,1
9801,I love maeve dresses and have always gotten a lot of wear out of them while still looking great this dress does not meet those standards on the nd wear of this dress the zipper completely broke i had to take it to a dry cleaner to get replaced at a pricey cost for a pricey dress im dissapointed,0
9802,I saw this online and loved it then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i couldnt resist the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i didnt think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular sm but it was super comfortable and very stylish it wasnt too big or too small it fit me just right without any awkwardness,1
9803,Love the color ordered the plum it is very nice in person not quite as burgundy more purpley i dont typically go for the plain dresses as i feel at the price it should be a statement but i dont have a dress like thiswearable as casual or dressed upsolid plain colorsoft fabriclong sleeves yet sexy enough without being too muchflirty it is on the shorter sidei decided to keep it as dolan makes a similar dress every year and i pass every year this is the year,1
9804,I was obsessed with this top i ordered my normal and was bummed about the fit in the shoulders the slight puff was too far in it didnt hit on my shoulder so i returned it to a store and ordered a it came quickly but it was still too narrow in the shoulders i took it to the store and held it against the and the seam was the same length between the neck and shoulder as the both returned i had no hope for an,0
9805,This top is so fun but more importantly it is sooooo soft and comfortable,1
9806,I had my eye on this one for awhile and decided to buy it when it popped back on my wishlist i can see why someone returned it the sweater top hits at the worst possible spot and made me look ridiculous like a mushroom top from the side i saw the potential but not enough to save it probably one of the worst things i have ever purchased from retailer,0
9807,I love this short i normally wear size this short just bit larger than average it is not to short not to long just perfect,1
9808,I purchased the red color in august after seeing it in the store it is cozy and stylishlove the coordinating pattern in the cowl neck i am and lbs and the s fit great noticed that it is now on special promotion and would advise you purchase now it is completely worth full price but if you can save and buy say a coordinating pilcro pant all the better right,1
9809,The picture onlin does not do these pant jsutice it makes them look wide and short well that might be why these are percect for me but on my body type muscular bottom they are awesome the material is stretchy soft and thick enough to keep shape and not show dimples lvoe the blue and green color so rich i am keeping the green as they are more unique at lbs i ordered p the yfit perfectly but my styllsit keeps insiting that they wil lstretch and made me order the p we shal,1
9810,I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it is not as pretty or flattering in person the yellow looks dirty in real life not pretty like the picture it is also a strange fitshape when it is on i tried it on in the store and did not like it at all,0
9811,I love these tla tees and i buy them often i find them to be very versatile and super soft i have several colors and they hold up well if you wash and hang dry i am a small in most retailer tops and these are no exception they wear well under jean jackets or even a longsleeve buttondown shirt,1
9812,Very pretty and comfortable it was not obvious at my store that this was to go with swim suits it was located next to regular pants but once i tried it on i realized it was somewhat see through i still got it as its very lovely im going on a beach vacation so i know ill use it over bathing suits honestly i may use it with nude underwear or long shirts anyway since its so different and pretty i bought a large as im a and its still pretty loose,1
9813,Based on the first persons review i ordered a l at first then i got it and it kinda fit like a maternity shirt and looked a bit too baggysloppy not as flattering as the picture i tried using the measurement guide below based on the bust measurement and im at the low end of the m size so i ended up ordering the m and s just in case the s size fit like the picture im glad this isnt slim in the waist and fitted nicely in the shoulders the blue color is beautiful if you are more of,1
9814,Hands down most comfortable bra ever,1
9815,I absolutely love this sweater it is a great quality sweater dress and a beautiful color so comfy and warm too i never want to take it off definitely one of my favorite purchases from retailer,1
9816,This dress is so gorgeous it fits perfectly is stretchy wonderful comfortable and the fabric is nice and thick with beautiful texture i absolutely love it im lbs with a pretty athletic build and it fits like a dream i love the color the fabric the fit the stretch the comfort the sexyness of it its my new favorite highly recommended,1
9817,I love this dress which for me will double as tunic over leggingstights the fabric is very comfortable for fall into winter for southern california and looks super cute with booties or boots this will be a mainstay of my wardrobe,1
9818,I ordered this tank and was very pleased with the quality each of the stripe colors has a different knit adding an unusual and interesting look it has a trim fit i wear s and sometimes xs but this fit perfectly in the s i agree with the other reviewers that that armholes are the correct size so nice not to worry about a bra showing in the armholes,1
9819,Very comfortable shirt light weight top with lovely floral colors great for springsummer with white jeans love everything one september makes,1
9820,Love this top its pretty unique and well made i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look,0
9821,Love this skirt i wore it to work after purchasing this and i had at least people comment on how beautiful it is many office ladies asked where i purchased it and one who asked the cost said it was worth the steep price the green in this skirt really pops out as do the gorgeous golden flowers the pockets are a nice addition as well,1
9822,I love the look of this dress but it runs very large i am lbs i ordered the extra small on sale got a killer deal on it i intended to use it as a beach cover up since its sheer but when i tried it on i felt like i was wearing a mumu even for the price for the beach i am going to return it im sad because it is a beautiful coverup and for what it is i think the quality is good,0
9823,I have been looking for leather or faux leather pants for a while and these look great they are more expensive than other faux leather pants but the quality is much higher im glad i didnt buy the cheap leather look pants i keep seeing the only caveat is that they do run small like the other reviewers said i am a pretty consistently in this brand but i got the they fit perfectly because of the material on the back they do not lose their shape either highly recommended,1
9824,This is cuter in person more of a brown than a cream like in the picture it runs a little smaller than i was expecting but thats actually good for me as things usually are a little loose up top im lbs c and an xs fit well for a sexier look but if youre wanting it a little looser i would go up one size,1
9825,After reading all reviews i didnt know what to expect but i really loved the design so i ordered it any way how positively surprised i was this dress has a structure the fit is great just right in all places the length hits right at the knee i was afraid it would be too heavy for a denim dress but it is actually thin and soft not hot at all for better understanding of the fit i am lb and c im between s and m in tops because of my wide shoulders but size in this dre,1
9826,So many retailer coats have gotten away from me sold out before i could purchase i bought this during the holidays when it went on sale i did not want this the be the one that got away so glad i did the colors are beautiful the sweater is really a coat so it justifies the price what a gorgeous piece to wear with all of my retailer clothes length of arms was fine on me i bought a large i am foot six,1
9827,This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love the style and quality are amazing it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting i am saying goodbye to vs forever i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazingit is sexy and classic at the same time,1
9828,This tunic looks awesome in the picture however it is made of an uncomfortable sweaterlike material not left of centers normal skin cotton i was disappointed once i saw this in person not a great material for summer,0
9829,I have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly i am with broad shoulders loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile jeansboots skirtsheels definitely a keeper as a petite gal this was not overly long if you have larger hips this will not hang well,1
9830,I love this dressbut and it saddened me that there was a but the material would wrinkle near the sleeves fit issue and the high neckline was a little uncomfortable i ended up returning it because at this price point i need perfection i would definitely recommend this dress it just wasnt for me,1
9831,I wish it was a little biggeri kept thisfor it will be wonderful for summer,1
9832,Love this tank i ordered a small and it fits beautifully i am and lbs tank is sheer so i wear a cami underneath length is quite long but i wear it with skinny white capris and it looks chic my only concern is the raw hem edge worried about how this will hold up with some washings other than that i love it i received many compliments when i wore it,1
9833,Got the blue white striped in xs fits perfectly the arms are a little snug but it stretched to a comfortable fit its very comfy and good quality fabric,1
9834,The colors are beautiful,1
9835,Great jeans great cut great fit i love the distressed look the rise was higher than i thought but not a dealbreaker i typically wear in most brand of jeans got these in,1
9836,Love love love this dress but if you are not wearing a slipyou should be please wear a slip you can see right through this dress,1
9837,This dress is so short i double checked to make sure i didnt get a petite by mistake im and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck it fit well on top but you could see my underwear in the front seriously i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didnt work out,0
9838,I love this tunic it is so comfortable and looks great with leggings and boots perfect fall look,1
9839,I went to the retailer store to look for an outfit for a wedding i tried on a lot of dresses and the staff was super helpful with pulling items and making recommendations after trying on their pulls i browsed the store for myself and found this skirt it wasnt in my size but i tried it on anyway and paired it with several different tops recommended by staff this skirt looks great with every topblack cream white long sleeve no sleeve short sleeve i thought i had to get it for the versat,1
9840,I love this skirt fits like a dream fabric is soft light and drapes perfectly i bought the skewed pullover to wear with it and the colors are perfect my new favorite summer outfit,1
9841,This is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket but i cant really walking around with a giant bulky blanket this cardigan is as good as i can get its so soft comfy and well made nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kindi like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight warm enough for the breeze but not too thick love it,1

9843,Absolutely love this jacket soft nice amount of stretch and the fit is beautiful im with a long torso and was happy with the length on this too motos are sometimes tricky for me totally cute and versatile worth full price,1
9844,Lately retailer tees have been misses for me but i was intrigued by the reviewers comments about the shaping of the tee to enhance the illusion of a waistline that drew me in because i have a short waist and some shaped tees just cling there and emphasize rolls more than my waist but not this one it is more fitted along the back waist and looser in the front i generally order size large in tees as i did with this one i dont think the fit is too big because its cut not to cling anywhere i h,1
9845,I first bought this top in the dark grey loved it so much that i ordered the navy too the quality is amazing as always and fit is perfect some may say it runs large but im pretty sure it is meant to have a looser fit i love the material of the lighter color blocked back its so versatile and easy to throw on ive worn it simply with jeans and ive also paired it with a pencil skirt and overlapping skinny belt and heels for a great work outfit received compliments,1
9846,I generally wear a jeans fit perfectly skinny but not too skinny,1
9847,I love this shirt great fabric nice quality flattering fit i have gotten this shirt in colors my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color not sure who named these the orange is a lovely burgundy and the white is actually oatmeal,1
9848,This is a skirt i will wear every day in the summergreat greenkhaki color casual fit me like all the retailer sizes doperfect only one thingit is not as short as it looks on this model i am going to have to have it shortenedbut that is not biggy the skirt is everything i hoped t would be and i know i will wear it to death,1
9849,pound year old grandmother cant wear wool and always looking for stylish cottonlinen sweatersordered m based on reviews very tight across back and sleeves too short loved the style the below hip length and color so reordered in a large still waiting for sweater hoping it fits better,1
9850,I l o v e this sleeveless blouse for is soft tranquil print wearability from day to night comfort and fit the design is flirty yet sophisticatedi wear it with skirts for work and jeans by night cant say enough good things everyone should have this beautiful piece in their wardrobe,1
9851,I ordered this in size xl the ivory was as pictured the lace details were welldone but the length was much shorter than on the model im ft in for reference even the sleeves were on the short side above my wrists the main problem is how much it shed just in trying it on there was fuzz everywhere so i returned it i love when retailer mixes lace into the knit of sweaters this one just didnt work out,0
9852,This top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types i am and and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hipswill be returning,0
9853,This sweater is a dream come true for me when i first spotted it during the off sale i didnt place my order in time to receive one but then it came back a few weeks later and i snatched one up needless to say the disappointment and wait was well worth itthe material is incredibly soft the fit is just about right im a size xs at retailer without fail and this was probably the snuggest fit out of all the tops i havea few other reviews says that it runs big because of all the e,1
9854,Dont buy this dress unless you are normally a medium or larger order it one or two sizes smaller than your normal size i ordered an xs and its more like a medium or large,0
9855,This is my new favorite dress its a lovely fall mustard shade the design really accentuates the waistline i would buy the other colors in a heartbeat on my petite frame the dress hits just above my knees,1
9856,I purchased the blue white pattern of this shirt the color blue was bright and contrasted perfectly with the white color in the square design this shirt worn with a white pair of slacks or a white skirt makes a perfect presentation for any occassion during the warm spring and summer months the fit of the shirt was true to size i love the longer length of this shirt because it elongates ones height the cuffed sleeves are perfect in length the classic style of this shirt guarantees many y,1
9857,I have discovered that im really picky about tshirts its hard to find a cute flattering one that you can wear with whatever this one is perfect the neckline is different the sleeves are short almost cap sleeves it fits nicely everywhere i am an and the medium fit well i love that its a dark enough color and not sheer why are so many of your clothes see through retailer so i dont have to layer something under it just to wear it its thin enough that you can wear it in,1
9858,This dress is adorable and professional at the same time i was worried that the print would overpower me but its a nice fabric im and the petite small is perfect i dont like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me plus its hand washable i havent worn or washed it yet but ill easily wear it to my creative professional workplace,1
9859,I was looking for a holiday dress to wear to the nutcracker and what is more appropriate than a tulle skirt the tulle lays fairly flat so its flattering rather than being poufy the top is a thick material but not quite sweater material since the top is warmer it should be fine for winter even with short sleeves and a cute cardigan or furry coat im going to sparkle it up a bit with a necklace or belt but it also looks fine without extra accessories fits true to size im typically a,1
9860,Very cute dress for special occasions or even work dress is comfortable excellent quality but does run slightly large,1
9861,Love this jacket so much so comfy and great for traveling i love the fit and the way it wears,1
9862,Love this top i was worried it would plunge too deep especially because im quite flat chested but it is perfect i think it would look gorgeous on a volumptuous woman too thats the beauty of it and the color is my absolute favorite right now,1
9863,Soft comfortable flattering great for spring summer fall and wear a tight black longsleeved tee underneath for winter not formfitting even if you size down,1
9864,I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews but i should have ordered my own size as theyre a bit loose around the waist the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering so i definitely recommend them,1
9865,I love pilcro script jeans the rise is super comfortable and the fabric stretch is perfectly flattering without being too tight the wash is great from the pictures i didnt realize this pair had the fringed bottom rather than the hem but they cuff easily if you want to hide it plus with boot season approaching i think it will make boots more comfortable without the bulky hem i wish they would make this cut with all of their products would love to see a pair of cords or dress pants,1
9866,Love the fit i purchased a mediumand like the room it gives not snug against my body the waistline cut is my favorite purchased three colors black white and mustard all are very flattering for my age and i wear with my skinny jeans,1
9867,Exactly what i was looking for cozy not too warm fits comfortably and roomy without looking baggy the print is beautiful will definitely be buying more sleepwear from retailer,1
9868,I tried this on in the ivory color because it was on sale and i thought it might be sort of cute a comfy flowy warmer to cooler weather transition top little did i know how much i would fall in love with it i tried it on over like things in the fitting room including a black strapless maxi dress i wore into the store and it still looked great it is comfortable loose and goes with pretty much anything ive tried and still havent found anything it looks bad over its not super dr,1
9869,Super flattering cut and the material is like buttah no seriously its like a yr old tee soft the colors arent even close compared to online though the green is a brighter almost grass green and the pink is more like a salmon color i didnt see the lilac in the store,1
9870,I love this top im wearing it today i bought it to wear under blazers and it works perfectly i knew it would be slim fitting and while i normally buy med or sometimes small i bought the large and im glad i did its still form fitting without strangling me the color is very nice as well nice fabric and well made a great layering basic,1
9871,Very beautiful sheath dress that will be perfect for summer weddings and spring events because of the delicious sorbet pallette its a substantial weight fabric that will nip you in and give the illusion of curves where none exist in a good way pattern is actually knit into the fabric not printed size p is the smaller of my size range so for others who are slender on top may want to size down if you have prominent hips stay tts or size up if you are very busty its tts or size up,1
9872,Lovely top that will be a great yearround staple to my wardrobe peplum and pleats are flattering and not bulky good weight for spring and beautiful for fall with a cardigan looking forward to wearing it with high rise jeans and and pencil skirts,1
9873,I loved this tunic the first time i wore it i ordered it in the red and it was very flattering on my postpregnancy figure and extremely cute with leggings and boots just what i wanted it fit true to size even with a few extra pounds around the chest area imagine my horror when i pulled it out of the wash having followed the directions on the tag exactly and discovered it had shrunk and no longer fit properly in particular the sleeves became incredibly uncomfortably tight and much sh,0
9874,I love this dress so much i got petite and the length was perfect it was so soft and so pretty perfect for a wedding,1

9876,Very feminine fun and if you like this style i highly recommend i am a and both fit the same so i went with the c bust waistshort torso fabric nice and light and i need no cami very attractive blouse and very retailer,1
9877,I love this tee shirt i love the higher neckline and the feminine and subtle ruffle at the bottom it is my favorite tee by far i am buying my second round of it now i have one in coral light blue and i am ordering more the only down side is that both of my current shirts developed holes veyr quickly one on the shoulder and the other in the usual belly area that comes from the granite counter and jeans top button there is no excuse for the shoulder holes in my mindbut i love the look,1
9878,I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it the color is beautiful and i like how it hangsflows especially the sleeves its not warm enough to wear by itself when its really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when its warmer looks great with skinny jeans flares and just about anything including the right skirt im so happy i purchased this,1
9879,This is a great fit and super cute price not bad either,1
9880,The pattern and colors are very pretty and the material is soft and silky i returned it though because it is very lowcut in the front it comes down to between my breasts which is not going to work for me,0
9881,Bought this today cant speak to wear but overall design is so incredibly cute and flattering i am usually a small or medium but went with a medium so different and wearable white is sheer so opted for a denimy blue color that i dont see listed available online,1
9882,This dress is just right for weddings and allit fits nicelythe skirt makes it fun and it feels so comfortableitis just a perfect solution for fun evening dressi always carry a camera to weddings and this will be so great towear while i am taking photosit looks current but easy to move around in,1
9883,I just ordered this top and i love it it is a perfect top for fall days with a cute leather jacket,1
9884,Love love this clever eyeglass print i bought the black background with bright sunglass print perfect for pairing with jeans shorts or a slender skirt,1
9885,The fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders what a pity had to return,0
9886,Im feet and hourglass figure i literally burst out laughing when i opened the package i ordered my usual small petite the dress is so short and small you would have to be feet pounds returning,0
9887,I am so pleased with this top it is slightly fitted i am lbs and have trouble finding tops that are flattering but not too form fitting also it is cotton which is a definite plus as of now it is my goto top looks great with jeans or leggings,1
9888,Love this jacket really wish it came in real leather as well but cant beat this price point great cut fit and love that the zipper is black looks like it is worn in leather most peoppe cant tell that its vegan,1
9889,These pants are super flattering they can be worn to work or on the weekend dressed up or down they are slimming and fit very nicely my only complaint is that they start to look worn the black fades as you wash them over time please dont stop carrying them,1
9890,This is a great top but it is really big i have a similar top from the same brand and the size small fits as expected this top is easily inches wider everywhere i would love to exchange it for an extra small but am afraid that even that size would be too large the blue pattern is beautiful and the fabric is light and airy which is perfect for warm days but the size issue is out of control,0
9891,I love this dress im and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture i have slim hips and waist so that helps i dont think this would be as flattering on someone curvy i wish it came in another color i like i would absolutely buy in another color i got a medium and it fits like a glove,1
9892,Just not cute i dont know how else to describe this top i am a dd and ordered a large it fit and was comfortable but the peplum had way too much fabric it actually made me look much bigger than i am i would possibly have tried a medium but it wasnt in store so i returned,0
9893,Simple blazer with cute details buttons on the back and lining this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties i was able to go with the regular size instead of petite because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up,1
9894,I love this sweater definite classic i get lots of compliments on it,1
9895,This skirt looks great on i didnt even think before buying it planning to wear it all summer so the aesthetic is great quality and design not so much you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates it is not sewn in or built to last then it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it but they said they would have to resew the whole garment not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran,0
9896,This is a great shirt for fall very comfortable and flowy without making you look dumpy tried it on in the store ended up waiting to buy online at the sale price,1
9897,I tried this on in the store in size xs regular in green and i was happy to see it covered my bra everywhere but it was a little too long i usually wear xspetite so i ordered it in the bright red hoping it would be less orange than shown which it was but it was more pink and kind of hard to describe maybe more salmon or coral i went up from my usual size to spetite for fear that the armholes wouldve been too tight on xsp but they probably wouldve been fine and the spetite is a little,1
9898,Beautiful top but runs very small based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up regardless i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an,1
9899,Love this blouse in yellow fit is true to size and it looks a feels great,1
9900,Love these pants also ordered them in blue great fit and style,1
9901,Bought this in the white in the store came home and ordered the blue wish they had my size in the orangemaybe this is enough said this is so comfortable so well made so easy to wear might be the perfect dress ever,1
9902,I ordered this online which is always a gamble when it comes to fit i was pleasantly surprised color is true white and lace is not flimsy which i appreciate good coverage of the girls so i dont have to layer over a tank also arm holes dont gap and theyre not too tight beautiful with trousers jeans or a skirt ive already worn it twice to work i know ill be wearing it a lot fit seems true to size i usually order a medium and i ordered a medium which fits me perfectly,1
9903,I love this top the unique neck detail is awesome i dress it up i dress it casual works for every adventure more,1
9904,So cute modest length perfect with a flowy top and wedges for date night or tshirt and flip flops for a little dressier daytime love the colors,1

9906,Bought this tank on a whim but im so happy i did so flattering comfy and well made,1
9907,I am and c and bought the regular xs it fits exactly as on the model soft and light and comfortable but very sheer cami required have to try this with both a tucked in cami and a cami bra great with midi skirts and culottes and maxi skirts and palazzo and flared pants love,1
9908,These jeans are exactly what i was looking for love the rich olive color these are definitely an olive green and not a brown color which i was very happy about fit is great i am athletic hippy build and a size fits great they are the perfect ankle length jean very soft and just the right amount of stretch,1
9909,The dress was great the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic feminine piece,1
9910,This dress is exactly what i needed its so easily dressed up or down heels and jewelry for cocktail this time,1
9911,Got the coral reef color in a size medium for reference i say i am because its easier than explaining that i am really and lbs c bra sizewise i am all over the place recently i lost weight and have been buying smalls and mediums and anywhere from an to a from retailer i so wanted to love this suit and am still in love with the fabric and colors everything in the medium fit except for the bra cups i am not especially big but there was zero cup room,0
9912,Im lbs im posting a photo one lady was concerned about it being ok for the over crowd i wore it was a cami under see pic it is comfy it has pockets and fits beautifully i ordered a petite its a little long on me buy i still like it and am enjoying wearing it,1
9913,Im so in love with these pants they are so flattering and made of thick material they do run a bit large though so id suggest you size down i also like they theyre high waisted the gold button details are gorgeous as well great pair of pants,1
9914,I purchased all three colors this sweater is gorgeous i love it its made well all three colors are beautiful and it fits great its definitely true to size im thrilled with this sweater adorable,1
9915,Love this top i get compliments on it every time i put it on it dresses up a pair of jeans perfectly,1
9916,I am and most normal size retailer tops are too big on the armpits and neckline for mei dont usually go for peplum but i was drawn to this top bc it was very soft when i tried it on everything fit just perfect and length was also right for me i like slight stretch of this fabric which hugs body nicely i would say you should get a size that fits nicely on chest area,1
9917,This is my th byron lars dress and i just love this designer his dresses all fit the same as far as i can tell i had bought this dress as my sister in law recommended it so much and she was right it is stunning,1
9918,I waited for this dress to go on sale and when it did i bought it right away i am disappointed the lace fabric is very stiff i should have listened to the previous reviewer i feel like it is poking out on my arms and neck although i appreciate the careful placements of flowers on the dress had the fabric been different i think it would be a great dress,0
9919,I just cant get past how different the blouse i got is from the photo mine has dark colors really dark colors this top fits a bit large and the neck is quite wide i thought it flowed well and fit nicely in my regular size large i liked the length and the fact that its shorter than shown it still covered my bum the back has a cute peplum ruffle and there are little bronze colored beads along the bottom edge in both the front and back i would have kept it had been the blouse shown in t,0
9920,I love baseball tees and this looked like a more refined version but it was huge and shapeless nice material and fabric but this one is going back,0
9921,Im so glad the other reviews were so good i couldnt agree more this top is very well made lined im dd and got the ill have to take up the shoulders a bit since the v falls a little low on me what can i say im modest i wish they made more colors this top is awesome,1
9922,Classy tunic can be worn with jeans or leggings neckline is small but stretches so it goes on easily color is perfect for spring my only word of cautionthe design can add a bit of bulk around the middle so probably not your best bet if you are tummy conscious,1
9923,Knitted midi skirts are part of my daily uniform so i was drawn to this one its high quality showcases intricate details the pattern on the front is different from that on the back the hem is asymmetric and is reverse highlow the flat waist means the skirt is not too voluminous the colors and pattern are reminiscent of missoni it should be easy to coordinate with solid tops wonderful quality and machine washable im and the petite medium fits me as pictured since i want the back t,1
9924,I love this dress i wish i had ordered a size bigger because now its out of stock if you are between sizes order a size up im in between a and a petite and ordered the size and the dress is too tight in the bust the dress has no give so it has to fit perfect it is so lovely i dont want to return it i will try to find a seamstress to help with the fit my favorite part of the dress are the side pockets theyre big and adorable,1
9925,So cheerful and colorful love these cozy pj pants,1
9926,I love this dress its super comfortable and can easily be dressed down with a jean jacket and some sandals or dressed up with leather and a good pair of heels the fit is spot on and very slimming and i like that the length isnt too short as well,1
9927,Saw this in the store and immediately liked it when i tried it on i loved it colors are muted and the style is very flattering the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south length is perfect for me it does look great off the shoulders but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more workappropriate look it does run slightly large i wear a large but went with a medium in this one so it wouldnt be to,1
9928,This top is amazing its a little stretchy but doesnt cling and its surprisingly flattering on my curvy figure i have a large chest and the shirt fits perfectly with or without a cami underneath the material is very soft and the print is vibrant and fun the shirt does run a little large the only slight issue i have is that it is a little shorter than i usually like on my long torso other than that its pretty much perfect,1
9929,I was pleasantly surprised when i received this top in the mail i expected the top to be more of a tee shirt but it is very soft and more like a light sweater i feel the sizing is truetosize but the design is not meant to be close to the body for me the shoulders and length were perfectthis top is all about the sleeves matador perhaps but it was the sleeves that attracted me to this sweater i will wear with with a vest skinny jeans and booties,1
9930,I had to return my original order to size down the bottom half was fine with either size but the medium was baggy in the back torso area im i bought the tangerine version which really is more red than orange its versatile and can be paired with various third pieces and shoes i do have a long torso and this waist is a bit short on me however,1
9931,I bought this in june on a sale and am so glad that i did its so pretty and classy the neck has stretch so its not tight at all its styled like a swing top but it really isnt there isnt much of a fabric abundance to this although it is loose and cool i bought an xl which is my usual size and the fit is finethere are layers of fabric i do not think a cami is needed at alli bought this in black and the floral embroidery just pops im just not a white fan due to cleani,1
9932,Love this vest fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket the fabric is softer and not too heavy the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture maybe half a shade darker can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses skirts and pants a very versatile piece that will go into fall i usually take a and the xs fit perfectly,1
9933,I am and athletically built and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length it is very flattering the weight of the dress allows it to move with you it is formfitting but loose at the same time so your body doesnt look lost in the material you can dress it up with heels or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual,1
9934,This jacket is so great ive gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket this one wins the color is nice and saturated the fabric is soft and drapey so its still flattering to my shape its slightly relaxed and i think it creates an easy look ive already worn this with a dress and it will finish off many other looks in my closet yea im lbs and took a medium,1
9935,I was excited to get this romper but it just didnt work im petite with a large bust and the blousy design of the top portion just hung like a bag on me returned,0
9936,This is so cute and i love that it is not heavy or bulky,1
9937,Love this vest i bought the red color and absolutely love the feel of the fabric you can wear it over a variety of clothesdresses turtlenecks long sleeve shirts perfect staple for the winter and fall,1
9938,It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint but its totally worth it this is a fabulous sweater coat i receive compliments on it wherever i go so cozy warm delicious not too hot to wear indoors either its breathable love it bought in green during black friday sale highly recommend,1
9939,Wore it a couple of times it is cool and comfortable washed it and the raw edges are starting to fray i might get one or two more wears out of it hand washed and hung dry,0
9940,I bought a petite medium and the length was right but it fit like a potato sack it was quite comfortable and didnt look completely terrible from the front but from the side it was terribly unflattering when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie i dont do formfitting clothing but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way its got to go back,0
9941,This sweater jacket is beautiful i wasnt going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy but i am so glad i did its super soft and looks great with jeans and a tshirt i have a petite frame and it doesnt look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do totally recommend this one,1
9942,This dress is so soft and comfortable i love shift dresses and find them flattering this one did not disappoint in that area it is long enough for work and hits just above my knee finally the colors are great the shades of blue muted red and peachy pink are lovely,1
9943,This runs sooo big i normally wear a large lb dd but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together i loved the pattern color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent lol also the back is slightly longer than the front something i couldnt see from the pictures online,0
9944,I love anything orange when i saw this coat online i ordered it as i loved all the features the features of the coat are fun however the coat came all bunched up in the package i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away i tried the coat on the buckles were poorly made i ended up returning this jacket,0
9945,Love this top runs true to size looks cute with in style army green cargo pants great buy at sale price,1
9946,I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering im sending it back,0
9947,Love this medium weight wool cape it is so much prettier in person the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk not itchy either the photos dont really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und,1
9948,I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive i love finding returns so i can see them in person i loved the soft colors right away my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too it also looks nice belted left slightly open i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely it doesnt need to close since there are no builtin fasteners i will wear it with a long button down shirt o,1
9949,These are my favorite jeans the fabric is soft but has a good amount of weight to them all the details reflect a high quality jean i usually have a very hard time finding jeans that fit my backside and thighs well without a huge gap at the waist these sit lower on my hips no gap and plenty of space for my butt they do run a bit large though i have a natural waist and think a would have been even more perfect,1
9950,I love this dress i purchased a size down from my normal dress size after reading the reviews im lbs dd and the size fit perfect the attached slip is a tad darker than my very fair skin color but it still works cant wait to dress it up with some nice heels,1
9951,This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully i am and the medium fits perfectly i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too seethrough which ruins the visual lines of the top bummer but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbsup,1
9952,I loved this blouses when i saw it online but when i saw it in on me it looked totally different it runs really large and i didnt like the material of blouse,1
9953,Perhaps i should have gotten two sizes smaller but the knees on these were baggie by lunchthey are very soft and comfortable but i wouldnt buy them again,0
9954,This is a gorgeous blouse the quality is exceptional beautiful soft silk the pattern is lovely the shape and design is spot on finally a lovely tie neck blouse that fits well and is made well im a busty mama and my the size fits perfectly thank you retailerpolgie for a gorgeous piece of clothing,1
9955,I saw this dress on the girl working the fitting room at my local store she had it knotted in the front with some cute cognac sandals i immediately fell in love i tried on the xs my normal size and it fit like a dream so comfortable it was a little pricey so i held off but couldnt stop thinking about it i went back the next day caved purchased its one of my favorite dresses for summer now i love this brand so i wasnt surprised,1
9956,Caught a sale in oct and purchased the gray beautiful light gray i am normally a med or lg and the small in this sweater was perfect i am larger in the bust so it is not boxy on me added a delicate pin to the shoulder and it was darling for our casual christmas dinner,1
9957,I usually pass on ruffles but this top is great luckily i walked by this in the store and had to try it on the material is very soft and can easily be converted from work to a night out the vneck is flattering and the ruffles lay nicely i purchased this in the taupe but the green is beautiful too and will purchase it as well,1
9958,This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger the material clings to all the right places and feels really good i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves try it adorable,1
9959,Ive been buying from retailer for the last years and this is the first time ive ever posted a bad review first of all the fabric is scratchy thin and looks very cheap second of all there is no v back its more of a slight scoop and lastly im so i ordered the petite small and its still comes inches below my knee i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup,0
9960,I have been eyeing this dress for months and finally a sale the pattern is beautiful and is a great quality the fitit is a swing dress so if you are a bigger girl this may not be flattering try a belt though the high neck could be a bother for someit does fit close to the neck but not tightalso size downtwo sizes i do usually a medium and i went with a petite smallfinally this dress can be worn in summer and winter i do a belt and a blazer for office and a light sweater for,1
9961,Love love i am thick in waist and have thinner thighs and legs and these fit beautifully size down one size very comfy no muffin top or tummy rolling over and nice boyfriend look without being too baggy very cute so happy i found these worth trying on,1
9962,Three tops for the price of onei fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would not too short just right then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked this can be worn waysback buttoned front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts recommend this highly for just about any body type,1
9963,Thought i would splurge on a tracy reese coat i got a size small felt huge on me and i looked like a wooly mammoth very unflattering another reviewer also mentioned on how it flairs slightly at the bottomadding to the overall bad look i had it on for about seconds and put it back in the bag to return dint have to ponder about it at all,0
9964,Love this tank prettier shade of yellow in person love the strap width and length wish theyd bring back more in lots of colors i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself but its an easy alteration and is totally worth it especially good at sale price i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors great find,1
9965,Love these pants retailer please sell more colors and patterns of these i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right dont have to be hemmed im and arent boring this is just enough pattern to be interesting but still neutral enough to pair with other things i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern,1
9966,Well i just love this dress great material beautiful coloring perfect length true to sizei love the pleated neckline i feel like an old hollywood beauty in this dress great one retailer,1
9967,This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thingit sheds everywhere i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you if you like dark jeans dont purchase before i walked out of the store the salesperson had to use a delineator on me it was hysterical sheds so much,0
9968,Id seen this in the store presale and was delighted to see it on sale im lbs and prefer a looser fit so went with the medium as i expect that it may shrink a bit but i appreciated the creative take on a classic look good quality of the fabric and this will go with everything in the summer or even beforehand with a cardigan,1
9969,I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant cool tone not orangey i fell in love with this one in person it jumped at me in the store but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice if you like to cover your assets you will love it,1
9970,So happy to say this dress was built for my body type im heavier wider in my upper body so the cut of the bodicehalter fits perfectly and comfortably going in at the waist and flaring out to a soft aline the skirt pleating lays just right since i have no hips or booty yes the fabric is heavier weight so i wouldnt recommend wearing in hot humid weather i love the unique print colors i do not own anything in this color combination the retro vibe is strong in this one so i,1
9971,The top looks exactly as pictured and i liked the fabric the fit is classic and i will be able to wear this top many different ways i was hoping that it was long sleeve but it is actually sleeve,1
9972,I splurged on this dress still a bit pricey even on sale but so far its the best purchase ive made all summer the terry is a somewhat unusual choice for a dress that otherwise would have been on the fancier side but it makes it sooooo comfortableits even more breathable and lightweight than the super thin cotton sundresses that usually dominate the summer my only real complaint is that the cut is a bit out of whack the medium just barely fits my hips but its pretty loose on topy,1
9973,I tried these on in the store today and fell in love they fitdrape beautifully and are incredibly comfortable while looking stylish im and lbs and the a i guess fit perfectly sadly i cant afford them full price so will keep my eye on them in case they go on sale,1
9974,I was looking for a dress for my engagement pictures and once i saw this dress i knew it was the one i ordered the white in a small size i am lbs it fits perfect and the length is just right some reviews said its boxy and has too much flow to it but if you have the right size it wont be an issue yes its a lace dress so its going to be delicate and youll need to handle with care but its worth it absolutely stunning,1
9975,I loved the design and look to this shirt but it ran way big for me i loved the forgiving fit but it just wasnt flattering at all i even went down one size and it still was huge sad to send this one back,0
9976,Gorgeous get these while you can tts has a lot of stretch these are so much fun and will sell out so happy,1
9977,Great tights with good color and quality i got a lot of compliments on my head to toe retailer ensemble,1
9978,This is a wonderful cheerful spring dress the material is slightly thicker than expected i suppose i thought it would be a little thinner or more summery but it really works for both seasons the fit is exactly spot on as i would expect for tracy reese im and ordered the p colors and fit are just like the product photo highly recommended,1
9979,Runs big but the fabric is nice and comfortable i had to return first order and order the next size up it is short in the front but a nice length in the back it will be a great dress for fall and the color is unique more brownish orange than red it will look great with boots,1
9980,Love these crops fitted through hips with full legs at and the fit perfect these look great with block heels and wedges denim is lightweight perfect for fall,1
9981,Super cute dress online on the model what you cant tell from the picture is the slip underneath is not true to size of the dress and the outside layer of the dress is more sheer than the picture shows so you can tell the slip underneath is very tight it might be my body type otherwise its super cute in person and i wish it wouldve fit better,0
9982,The shirt fits true to size the length of the top is great not too short wont show your midrift when you raise your arms not too long this is a shirt not a dress this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up,1
9983,This jumpsuit is amazingi ordered the small and it fits perfectly loose and flowy with room for boobs im a d and hips perfect for humid summers when youd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs in a very flattering way when i have it on i would say that if youre shorter than the petite is the way to go however i am and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model i lifted the leg a,1
9984,I have featured two pictures below one is size s the other is xs petite im feet and a d i highly recommend this dress i definitely could have gone either way but felt sizing down would be more flattering,1
9985,I love the tiedye look i ordered the blue color in my usual size small fit is tts love it just a fyi on mine one arm is a darker blue tiedye the other is very light color variation the white band on the mockneck doesnt give much so be careful when putting ontaking off i think its pricey but ordered during the promo so that made it better it came yesterday put it on w my washed blue skinny jeans out to dinner we went,1
9986,If i could sew id take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape after ordering a bigger size the fabric is just as it appears online totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it however this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear its also too small in my goto skirt size and i order a lot at retailer the waist and hips are small making the skirt too short as well but the bottom flares out ridiculously i ordered two of,0
9987,Warn and super soft love it,1
9988,The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it its a top i can wear now but only indoors with ac the regular small fits fine a little oversized sleeves a little long as in the pic the colorstyledetaling is exactly as in the pic no surprises soft comfy a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine i dont see the need for a tankcami under it i,1
9989,This dress is perfection and i bought the blue one please make this in black or other dark colors,1
9990,This dress is gorgeous it is somewhat fitted but i didnt find it to run small i am top heavy d and usually wear a size but i bought this in an and it fits me great i will say the zipper is a bit tricky at first i thought the dress was too tight but it turned out the zipper was stuck after fiddling with it i realized the dress fit but the zipper was a bit tricky i wore it to work and got so many compliments also the picture makes the background look burgundy but it is mostly blac,1
9991,The color of this dress is just so beautiful somehow both rich and airy i believe this is meant to be a more relaxed fit but that isnt quite my style so to achieve more of a silhouette i was lucky enough to stumble upon an xxsp petite in store i normally would never even try something on in this size but it looked pretty generous so i decided to give it a try so glad that i did it gave more figure and i liked the length a bit shorter with this dress i think you can achieve the lo,1
9992,I bought this dress online after a long search for the perfect dress to wear to my daughters fall wedding i did not want something full length or too formal after modeling several dresses for my boys this one got the thumbs up i do love the design and that it is different enough from all the other motherofbride dresses out there i will wear this with black nylons and wedges since this wedding is in a meadow im completely satisfied for reference i am years old lbs with,1
9993,I originally purchased these in a size and they were big i returned them and got a size and they did stretch out after wearing them once to the point where i could probably have gone done to a size the cut color fabric and distressing are great i am and the pants are a tad too long for me to wear them with ankle booties without looking odd overall i love these jeans and wear them a lot,1
9994,This jacket is perfect for fall lightweight and easily worn over other tops or layers looks great with jeans,1
9995,I wear cardigans pretty much every day since my office is chilly and i need something a little dressier to be able to wear that will keep me warm i love the design of this cardigan which makes it very flatteringthe longer in front is a style i gravitate toward and i like that the back isnt just straight but it has that little flairthis is not something that is commonly seen in a cardigan unless it is short all the way around and it was great attention to detail by the designer i like the,1
9996,Nice fit and flare style not clingy at all i got the grey color petite large fits perfect will wear with tightsboots or booties lots of color options to accessorize with,1
9997,I was hesitant based on the reviews but im glad i ordered this dress in blue the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured i had no issues with the fit its appropriately just a little oversized the styling is very mod,1
9998,This top is gorgeous and i exchanged it times hoping it would work i originally got the size a would normally wear a and the arm holes and top were extremely tight and the top was short so i sized up and still had the same problem i then went all the way up to a size in order to get the length of the shirt log enough but now it is quite large around my hips i love the detailing of the shirt but unfortunately if you have any chest at all it will not fit,0
9999,I usually wear a and ordered two other skirts at the same time the other skirts fit perfectly and this one was more like a size very disappointed for i really liked the idea of it,0
10000,When i received this dress i was surprised by the weight of the fabric its not as light and gauzy as the photos appear and it is fully lined its more substantial in a good way also i had thought it would be more of a straight cut but its definitely a swing which i prefer with the lining it does stand out a bit from your body so its not a clingy look at all i like it a lot but i dont think it fits the way you would expect from the photo its roomy i could probably have sized down i,1
10001,This is one of the best purchases fi have made at retailer recently i got this in ivory in my usual xs the pictures do not do it justice it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back looks great with black cropped trousers as well as skinny jeans,1
10002,This romper is so dang cute i normally wear a ml or i took a medium in this though either size would probably have worked depending how loose you like it its not too sheer and the shorts arent too short im my only complaint is the front toe came off on one side as i was trying it on an easy fix but still it should come off that easy,1
10003,I just bought this and really think it is a great dress it is conservative and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes yet i do not like to look frumpy this is cute and chic yet conservative also j got because it is black friday thank you retailer,1

10006,I ordered this tunic in xl and it fits me true to size its such a fun piece to wear i like all of the embroidery which was done in beautiful colors and stitched well the different fabric and the cut make this a very flattering top i tie in the green and pink in my jewelry and sweaters when i wear this its so comfortable too ill get good use out of this top for winter i like the uniqueness of it,1
10007,This is my third dressthe first one was the right size but the plaid fell on the dress in an awkward way the second one was a size too small but this one is perfect i am wearing it with a belt and loving it,1
10008,This dress looks very beautiful on the model shown unfortunately when i tried it on it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to i also didnt care much for the waist ties on the side an elastic waist might have been better,0
10009,I dont normally write reviews but this shirt was so terrible that i felt inspired first off the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo secondly there is no shape whatsoever unlike in the photo it bells out like a tent it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not overall this shirt is an insult to the female form retailer what is with all of these shapeless frocks in cheap f,0
10010,This top is really comfortable but dressy enough for a businesscasual office the fit is nice and loose without making you look larger than you are i get a lot of compliments every time i wear this,1

10012,Excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy i was worried when i saw online that is cotton i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store it is a substantial weight cottongauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery id say it fits tts,1
10013,I snapped this up under the off top sale and free shipping because it looks so pretty i ordered a large because i usually take a large or xl in tops it is huge i could have taken a medium if not for the lining which is tiny the lining does not cover the chest and bra area and hits the belly button area while the orange part falls down to the hips and it looks like a block and makes me look wide who needs that like i said a medium would fit better and would not be so wide but i fe,0
10014,Hi there if you are looking for a shirt you can wear all summer long this is it soft a little darker than shown in the picture which i like better and super comfortable it also keeps me cool in these hot june temperatures a great blouse to throw on with shorts or white jeans and it can easily be dressed up for casual fridays at work it is definitely oversized but no more so than all clothes these days i stuck with a size small and usually wear a size in tops so if you are ti,1

10016,Very unique shirt you will get a compliment the material has a great feel and weight beautiful color it runs true to size,1
10017,I love jumpsuits but this literally feels like pajamas it doesnt look like pajamas but it is soft and cozy and isnt too big or too tight anywhere i am and and i purchased the small and it fits just like the model the button in the back at the top is a little hard to close but the whole thing comes off and on easy which is such a bonus in a jumpsuit this is a winner it can be worn casually or dressed up,1
10018,This dress is perfection so pretty and flattering,1
10019,I love this shirts color which is a lovely yellow the fit is nice and flowing i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings my one issue is how transparent it is i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it however some women might be ok wearing it alone,1
10020,Yes these are a true clear red not neon red or orange red but a classic shade of red these pants are so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch they are a nice weight for springsummer without being too light or flimsy they remind me of j crew martie but i like these better id say they fit tts if not slightly on the large side for reference my waist is and hips are the size fits very well but the p were too big i also take a in the martie but those are slightly m,1
10021,Great skirt can be dressy work or casual love it,1
10022,Im a fan of yumi kim dresses and consistently wear size small so i ordered this in a small and the top was a little loose but it was way too short theres no way i would feel comfortable wearing this in public im and the hem was higher than midthigh on me the waist is also billowy and has no defined shape,0
10023,I loved this dress when it came out last spring in gray this year i got the red and sand color it wears so easy and can be dressy or casual depends on how you want to wear it i would say each color fits differently try them on the dress is worth the price,1
10024,Prettier in person so pretty im lbs and the xxs fit well i normally wear a,1

10027,I wasnt sure about this top when i saw it on line but it is actually nicer than the picture it is very flattering and the color is perfect for the summer,1
10028,Beautiful floral print and while i like the concept of this dress it was a total failure for me where the knit meets the print hit me at the top of my bust truly a disastrous look for a bustier figure since the fabric just drapes down and made me look much larger than i actually am same with the arms if the white knit had carried down to the elbow it would have elongated the arms instead of cutting them off mid biceps to make them look like giant hams im and a classic size and this,0
10029,I just purchased this velvet top in my regular size small so id say it runs tts and i couldnt be happier the designer moulinette soeurs is one of my very favorites here at retailer and always seems to come through for me when i need something really special its is a vintage style top that reminds me of something miss fisher from miss fishers murder mysteries the downton abbey ladies or the designer sisters from the house of eliott would wear and thats a major compliment,1
10030,This is the most beautiful dress i am so happy that i got it it is very comfortable and the colors are brilliant its completely appropriate for a holiday party which is what i got it for and ill be wearing it to a wedding in may also,1
10031,I love the tie dye and the accent stitching back detail is fun,1
10032,This material is quickly becoming a favorite of mine i have two other dolan dresses made of the same material i do wash mine cold water delicate cycle i hang dry it i am broad shouldered and heavy chested and the cut of this dress is extremely flattering you can dress it up or dress it down too love that,1
10033,I am not really a print person but cartonnier gets it right every time modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options the charlie trouser which they do every season is a great fitting pant going up a size is a must as they do run small with details stitching buttons pockets that make their pants look more expensive than they actually arei bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store the blue combo has both blue and black as well,1
10034,I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit,0
10035,I was returning something to the store before i stepped out of the store when this skirt caught my eyes its such a nice skirt with the gorgeous red color beautiful buttons and material that is heavy and thick but soft i paired it with a white shirt that is currently on sale and fell in love with both matching together it is tts im and lb and i usually get in size size was sold out in the store so i tried size and it fits me very well the length is great it falls in,1
10036,Love this top im pounds athletic build and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips it is quite low cut so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment but its fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting i really love the back as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders the material seems to be good quality and i would order this in more colors if it were available,1
10037,This dress is great if youre very skinny and have no chest otherwise it makes you look dowdy the colors are also quite washed out and do nothing for my complexionthis one is going back,0
10038,I love this top the seam does go across the bustling but if you are small chested like meit is perfect very bohemian and an almost classic look with a very contemporary twist there are splits up the side that show off a great pair of leggings i wore this today with some lysee black and grey patterned leggings a long grey camisole and some cute short free people bootiesi may have gotten compliments love it,1
10039,These leggings are awesome quality especially for the price they are warm and form fitting they are thick and the design is nice i plan on wearing them all winter,1
10040,I love the pilcro pants and so when i saw these level shorts i just had to order they arrived and are as good as i hoped the fit is great the length is great i dont like shorty shorts and i love the color the photo is very true to life in regard to color i will definitely get a lot of use from these this coming summer,1
10041,Well i wanted to love it and it was just too much i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be i also feel it should be fully lined it was not the exterior wool and pattern is very nice maybe if it was lined a smaller size would have worked better but for the price i needed more i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up i realize this isnt in the picture so no expectation but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines,0
10042,One of the worst shirts ive tried in a long time i dont know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model in person it is sleeveless huge short and wide,0
10043,I ordered this dress in the blood orange and have a few complaints while it appears to be made with quality it runs really large also in the picture the fabric appears to have a sheen and be somewhat dressy the actual fabric is just flat cotton its a very casual dress not as dressy as pictured its also quite shapeless on im returning it,0
10044,This didnt work for me it looks better unzipped the piece made me look extremely top heavy and i am by no means overweight but i do have a larger chest on a small frame c feet honestly it just made me look fat the design is cute but this is going back,0
10045,One of the best retailer pieces i have ever purchased high quality and fits true to size i have a large chest and this minimizes and creates a really nice silhouette i highly recommend got so many compliments i bought both colors,1
10046,You must have this vest for your fallwinter wardrobe the design is extremely flattering to the female curves i love the feminine ruffles the pockets are a bonus the vest is veganfriendly a hundred percent polyester i normally wear a medium but the small size fits me better as an artist i like to wear with my red plaid retailer shirt hurry and get this vest before they are sold out im sick i missed out on the museum district vest all the smalls were sold out i hope my experie,1
10047,Love these new jeans they fit perfect and are extremely flattering they look great with a crop style top and flats,1
10048,I originally ordered the white in this cami but after receiving was absolutely obsessed with it i ordered the other colors the fabric is so soft and the buttons are perfect as i just had a baby and will need easy access for nursing love this cami,1
10049,Love these im about and they fit right at the ankle the slit gives them a little more detail than regular jeans ive worn them several times and they havent stretched out at all perfect for spring,1
10050,Just bought this jacket on sale and i love it its like a soft compfy sweatshirt love the longer length i feel like it runs pretty true to size i usually buy an xs or small and the small fit fine the sleeves are a tad long but not too bad the model has them scrunched up but i find they are too snug to do that i would highly recommend this jacket just love the feel and look of it,1
10051,This is a gorgeous dress great print comfortable fabric very wrinkly though runs very small im usually a or even sized out at retailer and will need to size up to a,1
10052,I love everything about this dress the patterns are gorgeous and the mixture of fabrics and textures are so unique that they make such a beautiful statement i got this in a p after reading review and am usually a pp the dress fit a bit baggy on me but if i can find some way to tighten the belt it would definitely still be wearable i agree with other reviews that the top is larger my measurements are and i felt like the bottom fit comfortably with some room but the waist and,1
10053,Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape looks great on the tie in front adds to the dress i love to wear with tan kneehigh boots,1
10054,This dress is perfect for anyone with an hour glass shapeit is true to size i am and b the petite fit perfectly the fabric has a little give to it so if you have hips and a chest it will stretch a little without feeling tight and dress sinches in the waist creating a beautiful silhouette its the structure of this dress that makes it elegant and sexy this dress is so figure flattering i could not believe how many complements ive received on it,1
10055,Love this dress the color is beautiful runs large so size down,1
10056,Love this top tried it on in storeso glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium the color is a beautiful camel and the material is softvery grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool lol therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wearthe price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i dont mind spending the extra,1
10057,This blouse has too much drapey fabric and its just not flattering in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit sending back,0
10058,Super soft and comfortable runs a little large very cozy,1
10059,This dress is amazing i love the collaboration with rifle paper it has a nice boho swing look i sized down from my typical small and took an xs both fit well but i wanted the shoulders to be more fitted,1
10060,Hi i bought this top for my daughter she absolutely loves it the fabric is very substantial it flows really nice if i was younger i would buy one for myself lol,1
10061,Im lbs and im usually a smallmedium depending on the vendor i bought this shirt in a red medium and love it yes its boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think its meant to be a bit big ive worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it this shirt washes well per instructions didnt shrink or loose its shape and ive washed it three times now ive had many compliments on how cute this shirt is love,1
10062,When i saw this blouse online i thought it looked like a great combination of casual with the elegance of an intricate print i was so disappointed when it came the print is not centered in the front or the back it looks like they were trying to save on the material and just cut it out wherever with no thought to symmetry for this price the detail of centering the design was expected especially because this is how it appeared in the picture loved the blouse but i will be returning it becau,0
10063,Love the fit perfect for accomplishing the dressy jean look i always take the same size in pilcro and this is true to size but not stretchy as in some of the other pilco styles,1
10064,I didnt pay much attention to this shirt on the websitewhen i was in the store yesterday though i grabbed the green color because its so pretty i went back home to see which shirt this was on the website and was surprised the picture here really doesnt do it justice its very soft has a beautiful and flattering necklace and the flutter sleeves hang nicely rather than puffing out like snow whitewhich isnt my goal also because the sleeves drape nicely you could wear it under s,1
10065,I am really happy with these jeans fun fit high waisted great detail and have just the right amount of stretch i have worn them times and havent washed them yet i find this helps shape my new jeans and they still fit like a comfortable glove a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color love them i normally fit a ordered in these and they are perfect,1
10066,The material on these is super lightweight but still strong perfect for summer so hard to find great loungesleep clothing in summer for a house without ac illustrations are beautiful in person i wish they still had more in stock i want to buy for my momalso i am tall and i like that they are long,1
10067,I ordered this in xs im around lbs and it fits perfectly the material is very soft but not seethrough and the romper is wellmade i wish it came in other colours id buy more,1
10068,I loved the look of this dress online and its everything i hoped and more in personim and pearshapedwhile the bottom of this dress is voluminous it definitely did not have a pregnant fit on my body shapethe length was absolutely perfect it wasnt scratchy in the least i got compliments on the dress all day long wore with a pair of cowboy boots while wine tasting in napa,1
10069,Such a beautiful and unique design i only wish it fit it is so so boxy im thin but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right and i dont mean making it super tight the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately so i had to return this despite really wanting to find a way to make it work,0
10070,Love these pants love the fit i cant wait to wear them but i have to find the time to hem them first i am kinda tall at and i wear a lot of heels even tall heels but these pants are even too long for my heels and i dont wear taller than that to work every day only on very rare occasions so they do need to be hemmed they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer good fabric and a nice fit,1
10071,I ordered this in xs and s they both fit very well and i couldnt tell much difference between the two i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it i am about i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns the taupe and white stripehint hint hint too its just perfect i am in my mid s and have young kids so its great for my life right now comfortable too,1
10072,I love this dress picked one up in store at offeven better im lbs and and i did find the waist runs a bit wide because im tall i think the length was a plus but a shorter person would definitely want to go with a petite i usually wear an but bought a in this dress so i think it runs a tad large the fabric is weighty enough to hide minor lumps and bumps but ill be wearing shapewear anyway the pattern is perfectly aligned just like the online images and,1
10073,Beautiful summer top and so versatile its definitely worth it,1
10074,I hesitated to buy this skirt even though it was love at first sight i was afraid it would be to heavy and add weight im so happy i ordered this one itll be a closet staple for me i love skirts and am blessed to live in a mild climate in california i can wear it all year long right now i can pair it with a slim turtleneck tucked in with high heel boots or heels later can pair with crisp white button up tide at the waist and strappy sandals or a tank top and sandals it goes with,1
10075,Im glad i saw this item in stores otherwise i would have passed it right by online the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp and the fabric quality is great i had to size down for this dress its comfortable and can be dressed up or down its a great versatile piece,1
10076,These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not like the description says which is the only reason i gambled on these it is,0
10077,As other reviewers have pointed out this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos i can wear it with just about anything the fabric is soft and lightweight and drapes really nicely my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peachmauve but in person its a pretty standard beige i would have liked that hint of color,1
10078,My favorite shirt i wear it when i dont want to be in the sun too long it has breathable material in the armpit i loved so much ordered in other colors i wish they would make in more colors,1
10079,I loved this top the cinched in waist is so flattering or ill leave it uncinched for a super relaxed fit its comfortable and light weight so ill be wearing this into late spring early summer ive worn it with the green pilcro slim pants ive worn it unbuttoned over a basic black knee length jersey dress ive worn it over a bathing suit in west palm beach i cant wait to find more fun ways to wear it,1
10080,Really like this dress butthe dress is lined in a heavy fabric and weighs a lot for a summer dressworst of all there is no chance at all of getting the buttons through the button holesimpossiblehas to go back,0
10081,I purchased the coral version and the color is wonderful and vibrant it fit my daughter beautifully and she is i think she will be wearing this coat often she loves it she is years old and has a professional job so she will look the part,1
10082,Id been eyeing this skirt for quite some time so when it went in sale i took the plunge i hover between a size and though lately unfortunately its usually a haha the fit true to size perfect silhouette i will say it was more of a midi length on me than as seen on the model and im a near so for more petite girls the length might be tricky for me it was fine i liked the slightly longer length it made it even more elegant the quality was superb no missing thread,1
10083,I love this top i ordered it in a medium and its perfect im years old lbs for reference the detail on this top is beautiful can be paired with so many things love it,1
10084,This sweater is a nice addition to a fall or spring wardrobe it must be layered as it is sheer i read a review about snagging but i have not had this issue as of yet,1
10085,I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich deep green quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely its a great outer layer in the warm northern california fallwinter im wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for prechristmas eve cocktails and feeling classy festive cozy and warm,1
10086,Im anxious to wear this dress with boots i love the colors and print perfect for work and evenings out,1
10087,I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm they get the job done and for an incredible price they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside im not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but its subtle and i dont mind it they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots the length not a problem my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg retailer kindly sent me a new pair for,1
10088,Im in love with this print the fabric is very soft too as others have noted it is small in some odd spots and a little big in others but overall my usual size worked out great i wear it with a cute belt to enhance an hourglass look because its pretty drapey really versatile lovely tunic,1
10089,This shirt makes me feel stylish without trying i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying it is comfortable and fits true to size it is flattering at the bottom without too much widthpeplum,1
10090,Great spring colors that you really can wear just about any time of year with the right foot wear the fabric is a fluid jersey that drapes well the neck line is a substantial scoop which is very flattering i am very happy with this online purchase,1
10091,This is a beautiful dress but the fit was strange i have a small waist and larger hips i generally wear a in a fit flare style but styles like this i generally wear a for my hips even in a this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top halfi really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips it really is pretty,0
10092,Im at pear shape the pockets really opened up when i put them on and didnt lay flat loose on leg opening which i liked but the pockets sticking out around the hip area made my pear shape even wider i got a medium,0
10093,Love this top so soft fits perfect,1
10094,I decided to order both the black sand colors in the ml very soft fit is perfect has adjustable straps wore under my racerback tank today for my usual walk the bra straps were not exposed it did not rub or irritate at all it will work well under other tops i have some dresses that are racerback style i have other racerback bras but they just havent worked out either too uncomfortable or the straps show anyways this one is perfect its soft lightweight it has some moderate,1
10095,This is not even a dolman style sweater because its loose fitting everywhere around the arm the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wristforearm but this is not the case with this sweater its super loose around the wrist area i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve,0
10096,This is a great sweater that i know ill get a ton of use out of ive already worn it three times and ive had it a week i typically wear small or medium in tops and sweaters and ordered a medium in this one to ensure the arms were comfortable the nude color is perfect,1
10097,Bought this dress for easter and the compliments were relentless the quality of this is superior hence the price the fact that it can be worn year round i will get my moneys worth out of it my only complaint is the belt that little sucker was way confusing to me so i just went without it i needed directions to figure it out or a phd,1
10098,I am a size or long i need a inseam woman i bought the sm and they fit perfectly with all the excess length bunching at my ankles as designed im thrilled i bought the light color one thing wear nude underwear and lighter or just short socks these are definitely seethrough however i only plan to wear these with long tunics and sweaters anyways something always reaching down to my upper thighs at least so comfy and cozy,1
10099,Love this crinkle cotton top for spring the print is great and i cant wait to wear it,1
10100,I got this top in the brown color although it is really more of a burnt rose or light sienna shade and it is just lovely i love the color the fit is just right comfortable and a good length it feels very wellmade and has beautiful details from the pleated collarneckline to the slightly sheer upper back panel i have only one tiny issue with this top in the very front where it buttons there is no lining or fabric behind the crocheted lace panels in retrospect i can see this slightly,1
10101,I love this top it is easy to wear fun and very comfortable i was thinking about it for weeks and kept coming back to it after i read a review about going up a size i decided to go for it and i am very happy i did my new favorite,1
10102,The shirt brings back the s look of appliqud patches on shirts it is a quality piece with a bit of humor the length is shorter than usual for chambray shirts but also very comfortable it could be left open as a light jacket over tees and tanks fabric feels good on skin,1
10103,Love everything about these they are super fostering and comfy i am a busy mom and need comfort these are a great addition to my closet super cute with booties wedges and flats,1
10104,After seeing an influx of this dress in my instagram feed i decided to go ahead and purchase it last weekend im usually leery with the length of swing dresses for instance the endora swing dress paper crown is a touch too short for my taste in petite sizing either way i decided to go ahead and purchase this dress in petite considering no previous reviews mentioned the length of the dress to be an issue typically i take a size or xs in retailer clothing i ordered a size petite and,1
10105,Really unattractive shirt nothing good i can say about it horrible fit i cant imagine this would look good on anyone,0
10106,I think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring im and its a great tunic length on me its really pretty and i love it snap it up on sale,1
10107,The jeans are the perfect highwaisted jeans they do not stretch out and fit perfectly the perfect length for a heel love them all year round,1
10108,I wanted to love this jumpsuit it looks adorable in the product photo i am about lbs and thus was overwhelming on me i tried everything pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line wearing a variety of heel heightsi couldnt seem to make it work there was just so much fabric on me it felt like i was wearing pajamas and not in a cute wear your pajamas out way i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut on me this jumpsuit was just,0
10109,I am truly heartbroken that this dress is sold out in my size its is incredibly flattering glamorous and interesting and it has sleeves this is such a hard combo to find and i wish more than anything i can find my size to wear to a wedding retailer please please make more dresses like this one that flatter all figures and are classics,1
10110,I really like this piece the fit is great the double zipper falters and cinched waist and sleeves flatter i will say its pricey for what it is a cardigan but its a great versatile closet staple,1
10111,I dont even know where to beginthis is a dress for all seasons but especially the holiday season i bought it specifically for the guise of a holiday part i cant tell you what a black velvet blazer and black patent leather heels did for it the amazing part is that i wore it to work with a cardigan and booties with no problem my coworkers were amazed but its transition i have a slim velvet belt with a antiqueish looking clasp that i wore all day with it too and that was the cherry,1
10112,Iordered hte petite after trying the rregualr size in the store and i will have to wear heels with the pants or get them hemmed the color choices are all great i wanted navy but i have a pair of grey ones that look similar so i deciced on the netural if my size is stil lavaialble in yellow at sale time i will be grabbing those as welli went with my typical size lately lbs,1
10113,The pictures of this sweater do not do it justice i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch zipper is cute vneck is just right it is not too low i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot very happy with this purchase i didnt see the pink or navy in the store,1
10114,I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and its stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option unlike other reviewers i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines i received the dress yesterday am wearing it today and have already received compliments from even the most sourfaced coworkers who cant give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway the sunny ye,1
10115,Received the jacket today i love it but because it has no stretch in the material it feels a little snug across the shoulders i have long arms and it fit perfect for the length i tried to order the next size to see how it would fit but it was sold out ill keep looking for it to be back in stock,1
10116,I am obsessed with these jeans i have them in washes and hardly ever wear any of the other jeans in my closet now they are truly the perfect skinny jeans you can dress them up with heels and a cute top or down with a slouchy sweater and boots or even throw on with a simple tee and flats i love that they are low rise as i am short waisted and often find the front rise too long on many styles the backside is also super flattering and the back pockets are the perfect size and shapeno,1
10117,This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting the material is stiff and rough the skirt is also loud you can hear it swishing when you move and not in a classy way it feels like youre wearing a very long tutu also the pattern isnt quite as pretty in person they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos it does not flow,0
10118,This is more of a sleep shirt the fabric is too thin and see through a camisole would not look good under itwill be returning it,0
10119,Not sure why this is considered a topits an open front cardigan also the the maker is monogramhwr not knitted knotted soft knit inverted pleat at back yoke slight flare after the armpits slightly fitted at shoulders but not restrictive pretty much looks like the picture hand stitch elements seem to be the random embroidery sprinkled throughout the sweater colors are dark blueblack navy blue gray blush ivory and turquoise i am d and i purchased size mp,1
10120,Many compliments great color and so comfy most of my dresses from retailer are maeve brand and i have never been disappointed,1
10121,I always go w black but deviated this time so glad i did quality fabric not sheer at all a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe fits tts sm im lbs,1
10122,Got this in white and love the scallop detail the material is also super soft and stretchy i wouldve absolutely loved this in black but i feel like the white enhances my hips a bit too much i think this would be super cute on a taller frame got my usual xs and it was a perfect fit,1
10123,Dont think the photo does this skirt justice its a very flattering fit the kind of skirt youll wear all summer,1
10124,Great quality flattering cut could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps,1
10125,I adore this little sweater the pictures dont do it justice im tall with broad shoulders and small chest the cut and design of this sweater is so flattering colors work with denim or any neutral and the weight is perfect for spring or early summer,1
10126,I am very happy about the jacket i like the material and the cut i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day about f with a thin sweater underneath and it felt comfortable the fit is very flattering i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer lb got size s also i wish the lining was full not just the front detail it would allow more versatility but thats just meoverall i like it,1
10127,Im not sure i understand the negative reviews either the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves maybe i am of an age where i dont always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes,1
10128,The sweater coat is a must try on its a great fall to winter coat that you can leave on all day if you need i bought the dark green which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well i am lbs c ordered the size small and have plenty of room did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers,1
10129,This top was way too short im only and way too wide the cut of this top was so wide it looked like a tent on me i really wanted to love this top because the material and style sleeves ruffle are beautiful unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut ive have several blouses made by one fine day which fit nicely for some reason this top did not i ordered in my usual s size even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong,0
10130,A must for every closet very flattering fit although i think the white is slightly boxier than the chambray,1
10131,I worse this dress to a rehersal dinner and received so many compliments it was a perfect summer dress the colors are true to the picture and beautifil it is also very well made comfortable and flattering i am and lbs and i ordered a medium petitte which fit great it was short but not too short it will be a goto dress,1
10132,Great spin on a basic turtleneck i like it unbuttoned just as must as buttoned material is super soft good length,1
10133,This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i reordered it definitely order it in a size smaller sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid ps im months,1
10134,This shirt feels so nice its heavier weight and so soft i think its lyocel such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering i am lbs and cd and purchased a size found this item to be true to size if not slightly loose but i love the flow of it highly recommend the green is classic and timeless very versatile,1
10135,I am lbs with an athletic body type and i ordered a size small these were really baggy in the thighquadricep area and made my thighs look bulky the fabric quality is very nice and i like the idea of them for curvier body types my son commented that they looked like pajama pants and i agreed,0
10136,This shirt is so great i fell in love with it once i saw the back if youre looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz this is it i have wide hips and this tank if great because its a little boxy without making me look huge its excellent quality and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer,1
10137,I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model anyway i ordered the xs petite for lbs and it fits really nicely not too short the material is nice and soft nad looks like it may not wrinkles which would be a bonus the little gold buttons are super cute but you cant really wear this untied so it is pretty much a strictly tied short sleeves are flattering i think i may keep it,1
10138,This is the best i have the black and striped version and wear them weekly great layering piece and also for fitting so they look great with skinny jeans i love the snaps i saw this at full price but waited for the sale so that i could get more than one now i just need the gray one,1
10139,Love this topit is a full swing top but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectlyi have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of complimentslove both colors and having fun wearing themand after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the picruns true to size and in the arms slightly tight so i went with my usual med and fits perfectif you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size otherwise very true to size,1
10140,Listen up gals buy every color before they disappear this top is amazing so flattering incredible fabric the colors are divine and the price is amazing i am not one who wears peplum tops often if ever a coworker of mine spotted this one in our store and told me as soon as i came in im curvy generally a l or xl on top and i have hips and a toosh peplums can often either sit on my hips in an unflattering way or look like a maternity top on me this one is magic hits a big longer,1
10141,Really like this shirt easy to throw on with jeans black if you dont like the denim on denim flattering without making you look boxy arms are roomy too unlike the what the picture shows,1
10142,Ive been waiting for this to go on sale and just picked one up in store the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint since its billowy in nature a size smaller fits me perfectly,1
10143,The shirt can be a little boxy so make sure to order your size the peplum is a great length in the back,1
10144,What an adorable classic style fringed top this is i recently purchased this in my regular size but i shouldve read the reviews first and ordered a size up when i went up from a size to an d it fit me perfectly and looks so cute on i think this one feels well made and i love the little details of the beads and how the fringe is placed it looks very flapper girl i bought this on sale in the pink color and cannot wait until spring and summer to wear with jeans or a skirt,1
10145,Love this top it has a beautiful appliqu that is reminiscent of many past retailer favorites its comfy yet cute and fashionable,1
10146,Adorable wellmade skirt lined and very slimming i had to size up bc it runs a bit snug around the waist however its worth it bc this will match many long and short sleeve tops,1
10147,I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan unfortunately however i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach the chest fit well though it was very low cut but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes largerthe quality seemed okay but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long,0
10148,These shorts are wonderful very stylish and easy to pair with my tops they do run a bit large i am normally a size or i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small they are machine washable though and im not sure if they will shrink at all so im keeping them i would definitely recommend them,1
10149,This gorgeous dress is what retailer is all about natural fibers like silk and rayon and cotton unusual beautiful prints and colors not your average day to day find i bought this in my usual size l and while i could use a bit more room in the top it works either unbuttoned one button which shows the beautiful turquoise slip that comes with it or i am going to stitch it down the front so the buttons wont open and the top wont gap at the bust i am and the dress is a perfect l,1
10150,This is the cutest cardigan i purchased it in the red i wish there were more colors,1
10151,Im a teacher and am always looking for easy to wear pieces that will also work for my job i also walk in to campus with my backpack so i need something that looks good but is comfortable this dress drapes beautifully is really soft and has a wide flattering neckline im short and chose the regular size instead of petite so that it would hit right at the knee its definitely on the generous side i usually wear an s and i sized down to an xsi can definitely see getting a lot of wear,1
10152,Beautiful dress beautiful color and design as the other reviewer says it has an expose good quality gold color zipper on the back that doesnt show in the picture however it adds to its style and beauty i love the dress and so happy that found it in my size finally,1
10153,I am lbs broad shoulders and normal waste to hip ratio this jumper fits beautifully and material flows just enough to be forgiving but flattering love love love definitely happy with myself for the splurge cant wait to wear it out,1
10154,I cant say enough about this pant the fit is perfect enough shape to hold you in but not so tight you think youre wearing leggings this is my go to business casual cant wait to get another color my store had this in black,1
10155,I couldnt wait to get this dress i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag while the fabric was beautiful the sizing was way off this dress claims to be long and i could tell instantly it wasnt it barely covered my rear i also know its supposed to be flowy but it was really really wide i can see this working for someone around feet tall who is wider,0
10156,I ordered this top from store im and lbs i ordered size fir very nice just front is little to low for me but i wear ten top it will be fine the style and material are amazing love it,1
10157,I find that every year or two at the most i have to find a new favorite black dress or two fading etc and this is definitely one of those dresses for this year almost one to buy another so i have one that looks good in a year or two the dress is all around flattering and comfortable looks wonderful with high heels and flats looks good at work and while out having fun probably wont be able to count how many times i wear it this year,1
10158,So thin and see thru its not even wearable in public extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out going back,0
10159,I had never tried on a romper or jumper the print of this changed my mind and im glad for it it looks amazing on is easy to wear i kind of wish it were lined but its probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer i did end up using double stick take bc the front was so low but it was worth it,1
10160,Looks great on i am and the length is perfect hits above the knee but not too short also room in the chest area,1
10161,Love this so colorful and cute will look great with shorts this summer and will keep me cool in the city in the summer heat thanks retailer,1

10163,Sometimes swing styles dont work on me im on the busty side so they often make me look like im wearing a tent from a side view not so this sweater its more of an aline shape than a swing style and is very flattering i would think on all body types i love that it zips up and has pockets the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling super soft too not an itch in sight dont know why they call this coloration yellow its n,1

10165,Fantastic quality i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices the fit is tts i am smaller on top than the bottom and size fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design i couldnt tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit i rea,1
10166,My preference is clothing made of natural fibers but i couldnt resist trying this on once i felt it the cutout pattern in the fabric the color the buttons the design of the back all add to make a dress im going to wear with leather flipflops during the day or wedges a denim jacket at night its perfect for southern california fall likely much of winter this year weather im a d wont needwear a bra although i usually wear a i bought a maeve i like your style,1
10167,This oversized sweater is lightweight and scratchy i knew it would fit big but the neck is overly bulky the color is a bright blue as depicted in the picture fits a little larger on me than on the model im petite so it overwhelmed me,0
10168,I own quite a few deletta tops and this one nails it a great staple in a pretty color i purchased the green peplum tops can be hit or miss for me and often come up short or balloon out too much this one is so flattering i initially ordered a medium but exchanged for a small when i found the medium to be a little roomy on me the small is perfect the top is made of a medium weight material and is slightly fitted nipping in at the waist the skirt piece falls nicely and is l,1
10169,I ordered the white and the light blue in size xl both are cut much smaller than is typical for my other retailer xl blouses everything the first reviewer wrote is true the photos of the white top show a detailed back when it is plain like the blue the back is just a solid kind of slippery material its strange because its not seethrough in the back but you need to wear a tankcami for the front so it makes the shirt that much tighter since you need to have the extra layer i would,0
10170,And hits below my waist just far enough to make my thighs look enormous i think how it fits depends alot on body type the material is nice color pretty not cheap looking so i will keep it but must wear a topper to slim down thise ugly thighs of mine,0

10183,This was a nice surprise because its a thick sweatshirt type of fabric dont be deterred it is nothing like a sweatshirt its comfy like a sweatshirt though im feet tall pounds i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly what little height i have is in my torso i didnt find that the top was short at all its without a doubt tts order your usual size if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket the description on the fabric details that the other reviews,1
10184,This dress is easy to dress up or down and is very comfortable,1
10185,Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown however this is a thin cashmere for the price returned,0
10186,It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me,0
10187,This top is sold out in my size online but i was fortunate enough to snag one in the store great top that can be dressed up or down the ruching across the front is very slimming tried the top with skirts and pants looks great with everything i usually wear a size small in deletta tops but sized up to a medium to accommodate my chest i am a full c cup i highly recommend this purchase,1
10188,Just beautiful the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way the fit is really comfortable tooi found that the jacket runs tts maybe even a bit large but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers keep in mind i have a rather large bust so someone with a smaller one could probably size down please note there are no closures in the front of the jacket but it looks almost closed when youre wearing it,1
10189,Lovely sweater good quality fabric pretty color as the reviewer say it is very thick wool pile if warm is not what youre looking for you may want to think twice,1
10190,I bought pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time these chinos are great for my figure i like to think of myself as a diamond shape large chest moderate waist large hips and small legs these pants fit so great i bought my regular size and dont have to take in the legs the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who arent or something any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy im not a teeny woman either,1
10191,My only problem with the skirt was the length it appears shorter in the pictures and i cant take it up since it would mess up the front slit i would have returned for the petite but it was not available in the green color which i loved even though the length is longer than i usually wear i get nonstop compliments on the skirt and its very versatile,1
10192,Love this top and will be wearing it for our fall family pics this weekend it is lovely soft and flattering,1

10194,This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty im and pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size as for the dry cleaning i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect love this,1
10195,I ordered an xxs petite and this hangs like a bag on me im usually fine with the petite sizing but this didnt work and im so bummed the dress is soft the blue color is gorgeous but it fits like a bag i wanted to love this but sadly will have to return i think someone with curves will love this dress it is really beautiful quality just does not fit a petite frame,0
10196,I bought this shirt to wear to work im a teacher this shirt is so amazing im able to pair it with work pants to dress it up and in denim to dress it down the cut is incredible with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist the length is perfect and it just seems to create the most perfect shape the material is high quality and i just love the fabric texture its very soft and gives a tiny bit of stretch but not much i did size up in this shirt im u,1
10197,When you order online you cant always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get like the other reviewers i found this piece to be beautiful and well made its made from rayon and not sheer the coral cream green and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric this piece is meant to be swingy and loose however i started with a large but exchanged for a medium it still feels a little loose so if youre undecided about sizes order down,1
10198,I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it i was shocked when i opened the package first the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono which brings me to the second disappointment it is not a kimono at all it has no kimono sleeve no sleeves at all in fact just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu,0
10199,Everything that pilcro makes for pants fit me great i am not skinny but these pants fit me in a way that you cant see my belly i love when pilcro goes on sale because they are a great quality and getting their stuff on sale is a bonus,1

10202,I purchased this top during the off sale and im very pleased with it i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top for reference im and purchased a small my usual retailer size if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small,1
10203,This dress is soft comfortable beautiful and drapes so nicely not tentlike at all i wasnt sure about sizing and went with some reviewers who recommended sizing down but the small in the strapunderarm area so i am exchanging for my usual medium as another reviewer noted you cannot adjust the straps they are stitched together not tied together i considered having it altered but was assured there are plenty in stock i cannot wait for it to arrive perfect for summer or fall with a c,1
10204,Im and pounds and i tried on this dress in the store i got the small as it has a little more material in the medium and the small fits like a glove this dress is great quality and feels good looks good and can be dressed up or down like the model in the picture i like the flats with this dress high quality fashion and total comfort on a hot summer day go anywhere with this dress and you look like a million dollars one more little hidden detail it has a detachable slip underneath,1
10205,I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good it is a good weight for spring summer and fall i love that it is a natural cottonlinen blend the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it also i know i wont be disappointed beautiful sweater with great details,1
10206,I purchased these in taupe mint and coral they are extremely comfortable and soft they can be rolled up to different lengths i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great i can see why they sell out so quickly a must for summer season,1
10207,This dress is really beautiful in person it comes with a spaghetti strap clingy cotton slip underneath it runs at least sizes large i tried my usual size and needed to go down to a zero,1
10208,Disappointment city with this one and i am so lucky i had a coupon because if i would have paid the full they are asking i would be a tad skewed not just thin material but thin and cheap feeling doesnt itch but i seriously expected a lot more from retailer i have noted the name of the designer and have promised myself to never buy this label again big loser,0
10209,I love the style of this jacket i will be curious to see how it holds up in the rainits very well made and has cute detailsit does run large,1
10210,This is a great little top the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching i received several compliments when i wore it,1
10211,The green color is beautiful i love the cut and material it feels luxurious definitely needs ironing before wear but is a must have,1
10212,Beautifully made well constructed and kangaroo pouch gives it character turtleneck is very low sweater is very appealing great buy especially when on sale,1
10213,After reading the reviews i had high hopes for this dress but was disappointed that it wasnt flattering on me im pounds and generally wear a size small but the small of this dress looked more like a maternity outfit on me it squeezed the bust a bit too much and left open some of the areas just under the arms that could probably have used a teensy bit more coverage to be truly flattering,0
10214,This is a richly detailed top that i bought to go with some nice skirts the length hits right at the waist so it wont overlap a special skirt at the waist and create extra bulk it is lined with a flesh colored mesh layer in the white color you can see this layer in the photos but i wasnt sure if it was part of the piece or a camisole the model was wearing however it is still somewhat transparent so you would want to wear it with a fleshcolored bra or cami overall i am very happy with,1
10215,Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind ive been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well the length is almost tunic on me so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up if you choose to remove the fur collar the vneck is very open so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way knit fabric is s,1
10216,Well made versatile dress have already worn it to a wedding and work could definitely be dressed down for a more casual look im and typically wear a medium in dresses and the small was definitely the right fit with some room to spare,1
10217,Always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some its slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look find myself wearing it a lot,1
10218,The price was worth the splurge free shipping and a special discount helped the minute i laid my eyes on this sweater i was hooked light airy weight and that handmade texture make the overall design something special this is the kind of sweater that has enduring style the big kangaroo pockets scared me a little which i have determined to be not a distraction after trying it on,1
10219,I love this sweater combo as a larger woman i am always looking for flattering tops the draping in front covers all the right areas i wish they made them in more colors,1
10220,I ordered the ivory of this dress expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy instead i received a dress that looks like a ugly vintagegonewrong curtain of fabric the ivory is the color of yellowed newspapers the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place i wouldve been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music the fit isnt that great either big and boxy it could acco,0
10221,This top looked so cute in the picture but unfortunately doesnt live up to it the one i received actually has the print shown in the photo on the inside of the shirt it makes it much darker and boring the shirt itself is on the short side and wouldve looked better if it hit lower on the hips theres just too much fabric for it to land higher than that,0
10222,I bought this dress for a dinner after my daughters wedding rehearsal it is perfect it is dressy enough for the occasion it also has a casual look to it i think it is very versatile i fell in love with the colors material and the quality i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding buy it youll love it,1
10223,If youre not a petite and are reading this read on im always on the lookout in the petite section because many times us fuller girls can fit into these pros tts for me im normally a size ml in the regular sizes i tried on the p and it fit everywhere perfectly especially at the bust in which im a c fabric is on the thicker side but thats what gives it this adorable shape besides already being fitandflare pockets i always lean towards dresse,1
10224,This is a great lightweight jacket i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear im an antipant person the only downside is the price its a nice stylish jacket but not sure it warrants the high price tag it also doesnt look to great buttoned up has to be worn open i do recommend it though,1
10225,Added this dress to my summer wardrobe in the rust color its a very relaxed dress easy to throw on as others have suggested in going to add a belt to this to add a little more flair but i love this designer but it does run large sizing down helps immensely,1
10226,The print colors and fabric of this sweater are lovely the design is quirky to say the least i ordered a small as i usually do i am and weigh lbs this sweater somewhat gathers or balloons out at the hip area and is so huge that it looked like i was wearing a giant table cloth or stadium blanket it looked like i had a pillow stuffed in my backside because of how the sweater gathers up at the waist its not flattering at all,0
10227,The model looks like shes years old this sweater of course would fit a younger teen it definitely wont work for a grown woman please make some longer sweaters,0
10228,So i typically avoid jumpsuits rompers etc but there is always something that still makes me try them and every time im disappointed inevitably which is such a bummer so i knew this time wouldnt be any different plus there was only an extra small available to try which im definitely not an extra small usually a medium maayyyyybe a small but i kid you not it fit perfectly it was super flattering in every way the material is so soft and light weight but still thick enough i a,1
10229,I got this in peach and am not ashamed to say that i wore it almost every day in the past week over a tee over a dress over a tunicit looks good with everything my normal size s is on the looser side compared to my other retailer bombers but i like it for layering purposes so soft and comfyi have a feeling im going to need a backup of this one,1
10230,I love these pants they really make you look and feel classy i also bought the feather tank and absolutely love this outfit it is flattering beautiful and oh so comfy true to size,1
10231,Have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one i have a large g bust and its hard to find one without overly large lapels these are perfect and they stay down which is hard to find too perfect length beautiful color not too long in the back it has zipper pockets and the photos dont show the silver grommets on each side at the hem the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look,1
10232,Absolutely love the jacket wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties perfect transitional jacket from day to night,1
10233,I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had more left in my size it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my inches perfectly with no real give so keep that in mind the top does seem a little blousey which i typically avoid d already but this was still super flattering overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it,1
10234,Found this cute little black sweater on the sale rack in a small and it fit perfect it is flattering and will look great over a tank top or strappy dress the little details of chiffon around the collar and the tiny cutout holes around the back the softness and the little detail on the back bottom make this a perfect go to sweater for me i only say it runs small because it is a cropped style so expect it to be short but i would agree that the arms are more to the snug side than the loose fi,1
10235,I love the color combo look and feel to this dress lbs and the xs fits as pictured,1
10236,Loved this blouse the moment i tried it on it is one of those items for me it does run large so size down if you are concerned about the arms dont be i usually go between a medium and large and the medium was perfectly roomy without being to large,1
10237,Love the luxury feel so soft perfect for day out im and the fit is just right not too long or short dalls right at the shoulders too,1
10238,I ordered a size small i am size and the dress was a mini on me way shorter than on the taller model the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high so the dress was both too small and too big very odd fit the material is soft thick stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked this one is going back,0
10239,I dont own any peach outerwear because i didnt think it would complement my skintone this cozy bomber proved me wrong wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job thats eye catching great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe this is not a fitted style its relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist just like a regular bomber jacket i chose medium petite and it fits just right im a d,1
10240,I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all it is a great fabric just way too much of it it is proportionally incorrect width wise unfortunately this one will be going back,0
10241,I ordered this skirt in my usual xs when it arrived it looked tiny the xs was almost impossible to get on i ended up returning the xs for a medium which fit perfectly and is work appropriate my measurements are and my recommendation would size up two sizes,1
10242,This was my first shot at highrise bottoms and i love them the fit is very flattering and the print is adorable i just bought the bottoms so i cant comment on the top it looked a bit small for my bust so i am purchasing a solid colored top to match,1
10243,Im glad i got this skirt because its prettier in person than in the picture fiance loves it so thats a bonus its tts although its longer than shown on the picture very high quality and looks expensive im very happy with this purchase,1
10244,Looked really cute on line arrived with a large hole in the front quality and look was very cheap would not recommend this sweater at all step it up please retailer,0
10245,This is a perfect sweater to dress up or dress down very comfortable and stylish i love the slits on the side works great with skinny jeans or leggings,1
10246,I love the colors on this dress very nice on a pale skin i ahd this in my wish list for so long and it finally went on sale i ordered it and was very pleased only drawback is the collar was a little irritating but i am ok with it it fits like a glove o i didnt think it would as there are no petites but that worked for me the lace pattern is classy and the hem is totally fun great purchase maybe petite would not have bothered my neck lbs dd in waist,1
10247,Fully lined until just above the knee silk exterior rayon lining can dress it up or down very lightweight and coolfeeling this is a beautiful dress im and it fit great shorter people might need to alter it i tried it on in the store and felt like a princess but am hoping it goes on sale,1
10248,This dress is beautiful it is a nice heavy fabric with stretch and just fits perfectly,1
10249,Im upset i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper the picture of the grey does not have a zipper i prefer no zipper so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper i was disappointed its going back why have a model where an item that youre not offering,0
10250,I was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful sweater being that its a wool blend i thought it would be itchy against my skin to my surprise it is quite the opposite very cozy and soft with plenty of wiggle room im very tall and having enough length for my arms is always a concern the sleeves are long and comfortable this sweater is quickly becoming one of my new favorite go to pieces,1
10251,Im lbs and this dress fits exactly like shown on the model hits right above my knees in front and an inch or so below my knees in the back i didnt find it to be too blousey at all im more pear shaped so i like that this is flowey around my hips and bum purchased a size and it fits well over my chest and arms if youre busty or have muscular arms i can see how this might feel more restrictive great staple to my wardrobe,1
10252,I am always on the hunt for jeans and regularly buy paige these jeans are different than the regular paige styles in all the best ways they are made with super soft denim that is comfortable and very flattering the waist is high so my tush doesnt hang out when i sit i love them i am and lbs and these are long i can only wear them with heels but i was looking for a dress up jean and these are it,1
10253,Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews i am tall and have a long torso so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering maybe if your taller it hangs better i have to say i love everything about it it is a fantastic print it is very flowy but i dont think its too much in that regard i think it is fitting with the romantic girly style of the garment in my opinion not too short just right i took a medium i am and athletic,1
10254,Beautiful colors,1
10255,I love this sweater i ordered the dark gray and wasnt expecting fabulous but thats what i got the skirt below the waist tie is actually pleated so that it falls perfectly the seaming detail is beautiful i am between a size large and extra large and the extra large fit perfectly the sweater is short half way down my hips but looks good over a long tank this a medium weight knit and will be wearable all year with skirts dresses and any kind of trousers this is one of my favorite purchas,1
10256,Cute everyday shorts run tts to maybe just slightly small not too short for this mid s mom,1
10257,This dress was adorable fit great regrettably i had to return it since it wasnt lined,0
10258,These jeans are so great im thinking of getting a second pair for when the first wear out despite the price they hug my curves and make me feel like a bombshell the fabric and stitching is all good quality and sturdy these are comfy but they definitely are not thin like legging jeans love them,1
10259,I fell in love with this top when i first saw it on the retailer website and was pleasantly surprised when it was every bit as beautiful in person as it was online even more so the bronze colored threads are to die for and the fit is perfect on my lb c frame if your on the fence on this one get it its worth the purchase,1
10260,I totally love this tank the yoke detailing is so pretty i read the other reviewsi feel it fits pretty tts its what i expected i have already worn it several times since it arrived in the mail i love it so much im ordering it in the turquoise color as well every time i have worn it i have received compliments ive worn it alone with shorts andor jeans as well as with a cardigan and dress pants for work its soft comfortable and to echo what another review stated the material s,1
10261,As most other reviewers stated the skirt does run a bit large and long however it is nothing a tailor cant fix i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than midcalf the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what topshoes you pair it with it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture,1
10262,The design and quality are fantastici had to order a little larger because of my bust and shoulders its still flattering though can be dressed up or casual i wish it came in more colors,1
10263,Got this style in both black and green the fabric is soft and the neck design is very elegant i am lbs dd bra and take this in size small,1
10264,Beautiful dress just like wearing a night shirt great flattering fit for most figures wonderful color love the bell sleeves,1
10265,This cream sweater is a great addition to your wardrobe the length hits below the waist and the zipper adds an updated touch to the look is a bit itchy but theres room for a light layer underneath,1
10266,Got this in medium c lbs many of retailer tops im a small but this was a good fit for the m got the white not really see through but need to cut the side tag out as it shows through im not sure about the other reviews this was totally not boxy on me falls very nicely and drapes slightly a really sweet but simple tee shirt to wear in the summer you can wear this dressed up with heels stacked sandals or just with flats ballet or strappy sandals looks great with rolled,1
10267,I joked with my husband that if i were with the resistance star wars this is what i would wear i actually really like it it will look best with a girly skirt and blouse the quilting is lightweight and the fit is slim well made too,1
10268,I have seen this dress for a while and was holding off but then i decided to try it on the regualar size in store to keep in mind for my next binge the cut is flattering length is jsut above my knee so i would not get the petite on this one i would as others have mentioend wear it with a belt overall it fits like a nice comfy tshirt with comfy skirt but as a dress very nice,1
10269,An adorable tankwearing it right nowfits this curvy girl well though may consider wearing a tank underneath as the keyhole does show a bit of cleavageif in between sizes consider sizing downperfect print for summer,1
10270,This is a really cute shirt for spring i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down have not worn it yet waiting for it to get a little warmer,1
10271,Ordered this top in navy with white irregular dots since it was not available in smaller sizes in the store i took a chance and ordered an xs and the size and fit are perfect love the scalloped edge small side slits and the crocheted detail on the top great addition to my florida wardrobe,1
10272,So i actually loved this skirt the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together and its rare to find something thats simultaneously so formfitting and comfortable but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work especially with that long slit i might feel differently if it didnt have that slit because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office if,1
10273,Love this skirt its definitely on the tight side but is a stretchy material im between a and an and went with the six because i liked the way it hugged my curves as an hourglass shape i sometimes have problems finding pencil skirts they either fit in the hips and are big at the waitband or the other way around this one fit great throughout and was both slimming in the front and flattering in the back i was also worried that if i tucked anything into this skirt there would be weird,1
10274,This dress is absolutely adorable runs true to size i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect the denim has a lot of stretch i cant wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots dont wait too long before this one sells out,1
10275,I dont understand the negative reviews on this dress i absolutely love the fit may be the prior reviewer was trying a size on that was too large yes the fabric and the snaps are very delicate so you have to be careful putting it on and off but the fit is very flattering on most people i saw three different people trying it on in the fitting room today so i decided to try it on myself and had to have it the colors are beautiful and the uneven hem makes it more fun and young i will wear i,1
10276,This dress is one of my recent faves from retailer the fit is great im and i ordered the small and its perfect,1
10277,Its definitely not a blouse but i took advantage of the sale on sale and gotta say i love it its slightly sheer but with a plain nude bra its fine beautiful details very retro light and breezy wearing it to work and with jeans,1
10278,I purchased this in white my normal size being a a size fit better on me i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color would definitely recommend,1
10279,This is a really nice suit it fits well and is slimming with the cross waist its also supportive in the bust even and maybe especially because it doesnt have moulded cups or underwire which allows for flexible sizing the back rises high enough that it supports around the chest as well as from the halter straps the straps are wide too so they dont dig in and are comfortable the look is subtle and feminine in the black and the quality is good it is true to size but might run a tad lar,1
10280,For the price you cant beat this dress i love the thicker stretchy fabric used for it if youre a fan of some of the popular maeve pencil skirts like the tearoom pencil skirt you will love this for me its the perfect piece for work with a black or white cardi or denim jacket over it its a perfect length above the knee on similar to the model armholes are the right size and the overall cut of the dress is forgiving and flattering even postbaby super happy with the value,1
10281,I love the detailed cutouts on the shirt and the liner is finished with a scalloped edging perfectly cool for the summer time but also stylish and hip,1
10282,Earlier this year i bought a pair of pilcro hyphens as a birthday gift for a family member and she absolutely loved them after hearing from her how comfortable and amazing the pants are i had to get some for myself i usually only wear denim pants everything else is skirts dresses or shorts so this was a big change in style for meso far i love them they are way more comfy than i had expected and made from great materialim and lbs they s fit perfectly i do not have slim,1
10283,This dress is gorgeous it is a perfect fit and very flattering,1
10284,Was super excited to try this on but had to go up sizes from my normal and the waist was still too tight i was swimming in the top as well just a very strange cut and unflattering such a bummer because its so pretty,0
10285,I saw this in my local retailer and was blown away by how soft it was the minute i tried it on i didnt want to take it off for being a boxy cut it was surprisingly flattering i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes but i could easily zip the size large all the way up this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend or with a pretty blouse on under it at work i know ill get a ton of use out of it so i recommend it,1
10286,These pants are amazing and great quality thank you to the reviewers who suggested sizing up one size the trousers dont have a lot of stretch and are very cute and wellmade and the size up is perfect i am normally a r in most pants and skirts and i sized up to a r they are perfect gorgeous pattern and i too am not a patterntype will go perfectly with a number of the solid flowy maeve tops i have for work,1
10287,This dress has become a favorite in my rotation the cut and print flatter my body and accentuate my waist the print is subtle enough to pair with bold accessories,1
10288,To be clear i am not built like your models but the biggest problem was the way in which it tented out from the bustline down,0
10289,This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it,0
10290,This dress was a gamble for a nautical them wedding next year could not be happier fabric was surprisingly stretchy which made it move like butter the dress was stunning on and very comfortable which cannot be said for many gowns i am so glad i took the gamble,1
10291,I have gotten so many compliments on this top it does run very large im normally a large returned for a medium which is still a bit on the large size the small was even still large but much shorter so i loved it so much i just took the medium its a tent style or trapeze style which doesnt completely show in the images super nice thin linenlike cotton and absolutely beautiful love it,1
10292,I purchased this to wear on the same day it did have a strong smell i tried airing but didnt help much so didnt wear tags are cut so will probably give a try after washing by hand my fault for not checking this part it is a bit over my price range for a casual top so hoping ill end up loving it,0
10293,This would be a great blouse for flat chested person i am a size and busty i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through you would need to wear a cami under it,0
10294,I loved the details on the top of the shirt but was especially excited by the length of the top it comes just over the hips and gives a flattering fit as well as the sweet little micro sleeves the color is kind of worn looking but it is so soft i will definitely wear this a lot i bought a medium but probably couldve gotten away with a small,1
10295,Yikes quite a smell off of this one like wethot wool the color was beautiful but the sweater is enormous strange fit under the arms as well this one went back the same day,0
10296,I received this top in my normal xxsp size and it fits perfect its roomy so im glad i went with the smallest size the color states pink but its really between a red and raspberry so its better looking than pictured as with most off the shoulder tops if you raise your hands it slips up but it actually looks good that way too and forms a square around the neck that appears like thats the natural design overall great value light and flowy plus the fabric is a soft linen so it breathes,1
10297,True to size nice unique shoulderneckline fit and blouseyfull on the bottom and arms which taper in for me i prefer to wear it tucked or partially tucked in to add waist definition though a vest or belt can also be used sheer you will need a cami lovely flow and colors the collarpleats and neck tie add a romantic interest just beautiful,1
10298,Havent seen a top as fun and unique as this without being too much in a long time i typically like a little longer with skinny jeansleggings but this does the job of hitting at a good spot just at my crotch and the bottom of my behind its the right amount of swing at the bottom to wear out not sure i could tuck it in and make it look right as in the photo the bell at the sleeve bottoms adds just the right amount of detail as does the neck detail and ties the color is beautiful and i,1
10299,The first time i wore it felt wonderful had it cleaned and then the back end stated pilling very disappointed with the price and quality wish i could return for my money back sad,0
10300,I bought this at my local retailer store i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying ituh yeah this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties i bought the yellow its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend ive received many compliments the arm holes were small for me i bought a size normally im a small or xs in most tops i am lbs petite and fit the regular was perfect for me i was ok with it a little longer,1
10301,I anticipated receiving this skirt as i love a longer pencil skirt and this looks beautiful i opened it tried it on sent it backit is well made but has too many negatives first it is very thick i ordered size lbs the size was good but it is so thick that it adds lots of extra fluff around the waist and abdomen it is also very stretchy and fits in an unflattering way finally and most importantly it has a back and front vent and both are vented all the way up to the c,0
10302,I love this tee it is light weight and fits perfectly the additional accents like cuff work and detail around the neck makes it original,1
10303,This vest kept catching my eye online i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater which is fabulous when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest sweater the more i looked at these pictures the more i fell in love with the vest needless to say i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts its incredibly soft a great piece to add to your wardrobe,1
10304,Caught my eye at checkout and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick tryon which ended up being a great call the dress is super easy and flattering as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape the fabric has a sweet floral texture and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting im and it came just above the knee in front while the back was a bit longer another flattering feature this is going to be a summer goto,1
10305,This ruffle tee is adorable on the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south,1
10306,I have this tank in all colorsit is superb for layeringcomfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different necklineand its long enough,1
10307,This romper is fabulous i bought it in lime and the color is great and perfect for summer i do agree with the other reviewers that its hard to get in and out of the sleeves hence giving it only starts for quality but the struggle is worth it the fabric is lightweight and silky so it feels cool and soft it feels like wearing pjs its also very flattering with the bow just at the waist it hides a notsoflat tummy im between and and curvy very busty specifically a,1
10308,I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured so great for a business casual environment the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe,1
10309,I wasnt sure how this was going to look on me but it was so darned cute i had to give it a try and i love it im around lbs and i bought both a small and a medium to try the medium fit best the length is perfect hits just a little bit longer than the model but almost the same the material is light but nothing see thru about it it is slimming and looks so cute on so glad i gave it a try,1
10310,This is such a neat dress the color is great and the fabric is super soft i am tall so the long length was an added bonus it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps i am going to pair it with a funky tank top necklaces and boots super cute,1
10311,Agree with the others when i saw this jacket in the store i really liked it and when i tried it on i had to have it it looks great drapes beautifully and the color goes with so many things my first instinct was to size up to a medium to maximize the drape but it wasnt necessary runs a tad on the large side,1
10312,The photo does not do this top justice if you pull the tie a bit it shapes the blouse a bit i have a few work tops from retailer that i treasure they look good wear well wash easily and dripdry perfectly this top fits the bill too and it goes with navy black or even winecolored pants grab one,1
10313,I just purchased this sweater but have not worn it yet as it is still very hot in the vadc area the print is super cute in person it reminds me of a missoni knit pattern the color is described as gray motif but its really more greens and browns very fall colors the sweater is soft and comfortable the knit is fine not chunky and doesnt add bulk it is fitted through the chest with an empire waist and flowing over your stomach and hip area wonderfully forgiving of any extra bulges you,1
10314,I love this dress i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt i would buy it again,1
10315,This dress is amazing i bought this dress for my daughter for her college graduation it fits like a dream she normally wears a size but i got the which was perfect with the slightly longer length it is very professional but with the lace cut outs is great for a party as well it is very flattering and well made,1
10316,Id been eyeing this dress since it first appeared online but when i went to order there was no petite sizing then when shopping i noticed the carbon color in the petite section of my local retailer i grabbed my usual ps and although it was okay i decided to try the xs for comparison the slightly closer fit made all the difference suggesting that i had a figure underneath but not tight anywhere nice weight to the fabric it drapes beautifully and the lacing detail is very popular now a,1
10317,This top runs large i had no problem sizing down one size and could have gone down two sizes if not for the bust area i ordered this tee in the distressed black color in real life its more like distressed charcoal gray and really like the fit the asymmetric peplum is unusual and cut at a flattering angle i also really like that this top is not short i often have trouble with length at retailer being long in the torso even going down a size the length is great overall i like that t,1
10318,I get a ton of compliments on this cute and comfortable you cant go wrong,1
10319,I ordered a size my usual size in tops is s or xs for looser fitted tops i prefer a more fitted look for reference i am lbs d i ordered in pink and the color matches the online image the pink is shear and i do have to wear a camisole underneath which does not bother me at all the top is adorable with jeans or slacks for work,1
10320,This top is beautiful at the present price grab it the fit was tts for me a bit loose if anything the blue green color which is not pictured is shown in my uploaded photos,1
10321,The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material but the dress itself is extremely thin the nonbelted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress which was enormous in my normal size,0
10322,This is one of my favorite retailer dresses its flowy and makes me feel beautiful i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors it does run big so i would size down but when you find your size youll love it,1
10323,I bought the skirt in green in size i am and lbs it fit very well and was very flattering and the length was perfect i can see myself wearing it a lot this spring and in summer,1
10324,Several months ago i bought the byron lars pieced brocade dress size its a little large through the torso area but with the belt it fits good enough since i have loved this dress so much i wanted another byron lars dress so i bought the carissima sheath and the sunrose dress both in a they both were way too big so i ordered a size and they both just barely fit oh was i disappointedso one more try i ordered this dress the allusione sheath size and yepeee it fits perfect,1
10325,Love this so much i have received so manu compliments,1
10326,This top is so pretty the fabric is absolutely gorgeous and the lace on the collar and back add an elegant old world vibe to this beautiful blouse it is very light and flowy and i can imagine it will be nice and cool for those hot summer days to come i am rather large chested so it does look a little tent like from the side but that is not the case fron the front and honestly i really dont care because it is so comfortable and pretty i know i will wear this top quite a bit this summer,1
10327,I went back and bought this dress after a sales associate told me that it was super cute on but didnt look like much on the hanger im and curvy and the s fit great it will look great with boots or booties its very comfortable and nice quality material,1
10328,This really is a lovely shirt i like the long length of the sleeves as sleeves are often too short on me to wear cuffed at the wrist i now have the option of long or rolled up sleeves the fabric is the perfect weight for indoors it is definitely a keeper,1
10329,The fabric of this dress is absolutely gorgeous from the design to the colors i usually wear a size large in most retailer clothing but i ordered this is l and xl because these dresses tend to disappear fast in the larger sizes i ended up keeping the xl cause the buttons pulled across the chest on the l this dress has a slim cut and i would say if you have a small bust and are slender this runs true to size if you have a larger chest size up because this is the type of dress you want to fl,1
10330,Im so happy i purchased this cardigan every time ive worn it ive actually gotten compliments from both women and men i was slightly undecided at first due to its quite pricey but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper not just a quick trend im so happy i snagged it before it ran out i have quite muscular upper arms and the medium fits me well the sleeves do have some give in them and even though im also broad across my shoul,1
10331,I bought this top in white i wore it with black skinny crop jeans it is very cute and flattering the length is just so that it makes the swing top flattering without is bring too overwhelming i received lots of compliments the quality is great and the top washed up well too love it for reference im lbs and bought the top in small,1
10332,This poncho is dreamy the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy it being wool i cant say that im surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat,1
10333,Really cute dress i bought the white i am usually a size in retailer dresses but i could not even zip this side zip was also slightly awkward had to return waiting for the,1
10334,Love these wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots nice subtle print i think they run about size small im normally a size the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough incidentally i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too love love,1
10335,This structured sweater is beautiful and timeless gorgeous seasonal color and style is classic i typically order medium but wanted a more flowy look and got a large great purchase great fit,1
10336,I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summerearly fall the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top i am pleased with my purchase,1
10337,I was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i dont mind its a trend of the season and i absolutely dont mind to look like a mattress or wear robe the garment runs large so i wear usually and have to get xs i am lbs usually wear sm in jackets it hits me inches below my knee i love it,1
10338,This top is perfect to dress up and dress down pair it with high wasted pants and you are set,1
10339,I hardly believe i have not reviewed htis yet so i tried it on in the sotre and was not convinced my usual xs looked huge and hte hip part flared out in a funny way i did however decide to order it online in petties to see i really do love the design in the front and the hemline is fun and unusual they didnt have my usual xs so odrdered xxs just to see what a great choice it fits like a glove now and the swaeter is jsut so beautiful jsut wish it wasnt so pricey but wil ke,1
10340,I cannot speak more highly of these jeans i am a standard size and have never been able to purchase a pair of jeans and wear them right away i always have to hem them by massive amounts these jeans are so flattering the wash is amazing i have worn them with cute ballet flats and tall boots so far but i think the possibilities are endless i am petite but in a curvy way and i havent felt these great in a pair of jeans in so long the wash is great for dress updress down i have,1
10341,So pretty comfortable love it,1
10342,This maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind the fabric is very comfortable the print is very nice perfect find,1
10343,First of all mine arrived in a regular denim shade not the dark wash shown also the style is more like a blazer and it was huge i am and ordered the petite xs but even xxs would have looked like a baggy blazer as well the sleeves came barely past my wrists they are designed to cuff as the model has done perhaps on someone taller and younger it would look edgy and chic the quality is excellent with some nice details this might be one to try in person if you can,0
10344,This is a great go to top it isnt too low too tight too dressy or too casual im and ordered a small petite it fits perfectly especially under the arms where tops always show my bra it doesnt go too low i have to admit i purchased the dusty rose color im not sure how great it complements my olive skin but i love it anyway,1
10345,Quality length size design are all perfect im sometimes a picky person but i cant say one thing less about this cardigan its all wool but it feels so soft and comfortable and it doesnt wrinkle i put it in my purse for a couple of hours still great when taken out thin but dont you plan to wear something underneath it goes with everything,1
10346,I love it the fit is very flattering i read in another review that the top runs small so i got a small instead of an extra small and it fits perfectly,1
10347,Very flattering dress in a comfortable material the cut is perfectly placed this is very long im and in flats this touches the floor easily dressed up or down with the tight accessories,1
10348,This garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it i am probably between a small and xsmall but ordered the xsmall it is snug but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath just in case the buttons gap just a little i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping it is also a little snug in the elbow area,1
10349,I bought shirts in gold black and red they arrived larger than expected after the first wash and air dry they shrunk i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash,0
10350,I got these in the mail today and to me they look exactly like the pants my mamaw used to wear in the s they were super comfy but not cute at all on me they do run large like other reviews say i am usually an or med and these in the small were the right choice going back because they just look horrible on me though,0
10351,This is quite long on my frame but its wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter so happy i finally ordered this,1
10352,I originally ordered this top in the black and its been on back order for a month i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade pattern the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fallwinter i highly recommend this top for all body types,1
10353,Bought the pink color in the store and just loved the way that they fit me i ended up ordering the light blue perfect for a cool summer evening can be worn with sandals wedges or converse sneakers,1
10354,Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top i went down one size since i am a true petite they were sold out of the petite small but the regular xsmall fit perfect it is a little short so its perfect for shorter people,1
10355,I absolutely love this brait is the most comfortable aesthetically pleasing sports bra i have ever owned i love the straps they take some patience to get aligned properly once the bra is one but afterward it looks amazing the bra itself is soft and the padded inserts actually stay in place without much manipulation so they are aligned properly when moving i do not have any areas that rub or get irritated uncomfortably i absolutely love this bra it gives me the support i need for a high,1
10356,My mother who is not a dress person ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills wed spend hours searching for the perfect dress and shed returned three other options different stores after admiring this dress for awhile she decided to try it and is so happy she did the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images but thats what she was hoping for it fits wonderfully and looks extremely elegant,1
10357,This romper checks off all the boxes its beautiful and the fit is perfect,1
10358,Thank you retailer these really are the perfect black pants great fit and construction the material doesnt wrinkle they slim and shape the body and they are at a good price point i did have to go up one size but i especially love the elastic in the waistband my local store almost sold out of these in a day,1
10359,Love this tank its super soft and has a lovely drape i got colors on sale and am so glad i did,1
10360,I dont ever do ruffles im a ddd but these laid so nicely and the vertical ruffle is very flattering for a less than flat tummy the knit back is so soft and makes this easy to wear it will be easy to dress up with a necklace blazer and dressy pants but it will go just as nicely on its on with jeans for a casual look if there had been the mint color in my size i would have gotten it too,1
10361,Dont be fooled by the photos online the color is a bright baby blue not pale blue its a beautifully designed dress however the material is so bulky and heavy its so unflattering i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true this dress just hung on me and pulled me down i wanted so much to love it but i returned it,0
10362,I absolutely love this dress the quality is perfection the design is adorable and it is comfortable i paired it with leggings and short boots and worked hours in it and i worked a large event so i wansup moving things and active almost the entire time it was the perfect combination of dressing up for work yet being fully functional oh and the neck line ads that extra touch of style that makes it a great piece love this it is also true to size i have a medium,1
10363,I love this dress be warned that even at it is right on the edge of the shortest length that i can get away with wearing i probably will not wear it to church but for a special event dinner or the theater it will be an eye catching statement piece without being over the top it has a quiet appeal both layers of fabric are thin but that helps it to conform to my figure without hugging it it softly drapes showing an hourglass while being extremely comfortable i think some reviewers int,1
10364,I hesitated to buy this after reading the earlier review but went ahead anyhow and am glad i did i ordered the white in a small petite and it is as cute as can be it is crisp and true white not off white there is a large pleat on one side of the front to give the blouse some interest and there are openings on each side which allow the blouse to swing a bit but do not open up to reveal skin it is not long but by no means is it cropped it is really sweet with slim jeans or slim printed,1
10365,I ordered this in the red stripe material i love it it is so soft and easy to wear im wearing it as a bathing suit cover a nice pink slip is included,1
10366,This is a beautiful tunic dress and the detail makes it so soft and feminine i would never have bought it online because it looks so plain but in the store today just couldnt believe how pretty im mature so i plan to wear with black leggings and a nice scarf but could easily be worn alone or with jeans i think it will transition into spring for two season wear im small but large busted size h braand the small was perfect cant wait to wear it,1
10367,I got compliments the moment i walked into the office with those they look like leather so much that i had to ensure some people that only some polyester had to die so i could wear them i am slim but i think those pants are cut so well and hang so nicely they make everybody look slimmer they are also super soft very comjfortable and the pockets are big enough to hold my beloved smart phone securely without showing a bulge the pants look very elegant when paired with the right shoes,1
10368,This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body im thin and usually wear a size so im not sure who this may look good on,0
10369,Love this cardigan fits just as i expected very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back,1
10370,I saw this online and didnt think twice about it but then i came across it at my local store and its so much better in person it is incredibly soft and cozy i purchased the gray stripe version and two solid color versions creamforrest green i can see this being a great staple over the fallwinter with leggings boots and a long pendant,1
10371,Love how these fit they are warm and such a good price i got pairs i washed mine in a garment bag and it washed just fine i hung them dry,1
10372,Light and airy runs really small had to go up sizes a little pricy but overall a cute blouse not your typical blouse,1
10373,Super comfy skirt cant wait to wear it to football games this season,1
10374,Bought in the store will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace does not fit like it looks on the model it is more fitted i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt not including tassels reaches the top of my jeans and the tassels hang below it is a very versatile top one that can be dressed up or down sleeves above wrist,1
10375,I love these jeans they can be dressed up or dresses down super cute with tall boots or loafers i wear them all the time,1
10376,I purchased this in colors the black which is really actually a dark grey no complaints and the cream with black print version i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime looks great with skinny pants or jeans great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan does run on the looser side fyi,1
10377,I ordered this online and when i opened the package i was impressed with the quality of the material and stitching for this top it is much nicer than a basic tshirtwhen i tried this on the band of stitching that was supposed to go beneath my chest was sitting on top of my cleavage also the overall length is listed as long but i think that is the back of the shirt the front of the shirt is very short on me im hitting well above my hip bonesif only this was much m,0
10378,This skirt is adorable there is no give to it though i usually wear a and got the and i cant gain a pound or it wont zip it is perfect for spring and summer im,1
10379,Super cute and more fitted than the baggy overalls of yesteryear i love them,1
10380,I love these pants they are slimming can be easily dressed up or down and they are super soft and comfortable,1
10381,This is one of those why we shop at retailer dressesthis dress arrived today via lasership in an actual box both deliveries from this service far surpass fedex ups and certainly usps which crams an expensive item in an unprotected plastic bag into the mailbox okay off my soapbox and thanks for the free shipping weekendraspberry is quite beautiful truly as pictured the lacework should be more resilient than many the shape is reigned in by the bodice not elastic btw and the,1
10382,Normally i would never try on anything with horizontal stripes but for some reason i saw it in my store and gave the dress a try fit is perfect and dress is lined side note my store had the navy dress and the stripes are horizontal and not diagonal as pictured on the model dress looks like the ivory dress can be dressed up or down so ill be a great summer go to dress i am a curvy girl and because of the different widths of the stripes the dress works and is very flattering im ve,1
10383,This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time i am a the small was tts and so flattering i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it it isnt lined and could definitely show figure flaws for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust waist and hip c it fits me like the model in the image the one down side is that it is pullover,1
10384,I normally take a small or medium in antrho tops i ordered the xss and im kind of swimming in it i think its a good look though and will complement shorts or skinny jeans i could wear this through all seasons in the pnw so i expect to get a lot of use out of it i was afraid the embroidered shoulders would be stiff and stick out but that isnt the case at all the sweater is all soft and flowy drapes nicely and can be easily dressed up or down worth the price,1
10385,I didnt have high hopes for these because things seem to ride on me but these stay put and i love the adjustable sides these are a pretty color i ordered the raspberry and the silver grey and love both i normally would not pay a ton for undies but these are worth every dollar i have a larger bottom so purchased the large but sometimes i can wear medium so this is great being adjustable,1
10386,I agree with the other reviews this top runs large so size down with that being said this is a beautiful top love it,1
10387,Love this poncho its casual has a bit of a sexy vibe comfy great with leggings probably boots once its a little cooler soft and lacey lace is sheer so a cami is needed,1
10388,I love this dress but the top runs very small i am lbs small frame and the was tight is my go to size at retailer i had to return it i wish i had bought the now,1
10389,Tried this dress on in a s and it fit very nicely its a very unique dress and i loved it but i just didnt know where i would wear it,1
10390,True this blazer runs small so size up beyond the beautiful depth of color from the herringbone black and dark blue the stretchy fabric allows for flexibility in what you can wear underneath and for both your bloated and your skinny days best of all this blazer could be worn seasons out if the year and its got a supersoft lining,1
10391,When i saw this i had to have it i was pleasantly surprised that i was actually able to go down a size normally a l for the bust but was able to get into the medium with some room across the chest it drapes nicely and the inner liner is not tight but flows along with the dress so many compliments each time i wear it,1
10392,Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut thats flattering feminine fun i sized up and ordered the the p to fit my large rounded rib cage dds i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine stats are dd on top on bottom,1
10393,The color and fit is amazing on this dress i am and went with the small and the length wasnt too short either,1
10394,I love it i was hesitant to spend so much on a suit but its well worth the money im lbs and my stomach is my biggest problem area i ordered a size and its a perfect fit and very flattering,1
10395,As soon as i saw this skirt i was in love i like the fit it is very comfortable i love the detail in the crocheted part of the skirt i cant wait to wear it and i recommend this item,1
10396,Love this dress the stripes are flattering the material is interesting and it swings its feminine and fun,1
10397,This top is so cute i dont usually like crochet tops but when i saw this i just had to order it so glad i did my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke but that can be fixed,1
10398,This is a bit pricey but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail the sleeves are upturned and tacked the curvy hem is very flattering and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side just to add to the careful custom detail the cotton modal is deliciously soft the fine detail in cut fit artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure,1
10399,I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on but i am so happy i did they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff incredibly comfortable i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose,1
10400,Beautiful unique colors perfect for winter i received so many compliments at two holiday parties and on sale this is a nobrainer,1
10401,The design and quality were great i really wanted them to fit but they ran large im and lbs and orderd the small unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i wont be trying a size down the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward sadly these went back,0
10402,I am usually a or in dresses and i ended up with a in this one i could barley zip up the and while i could have gotten away with the there is no elasticity in the waistband the is very slightly roomy but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me for reference im lbs and a b when i was finally able to wear the dress i got compliments galore it really is a beautiful dress just be sure to size up,1
10403,My daughter had one and wore it with everythingi ended up getting one myselfit is a perfect weight,1

10405,I wear a i bought a and they fit perfect in every way they were even almost too long so i can wear with heels if i want i am so glad i bought these dont let the folded cuff in the picture deceive you a great pair of straight leg jeans,1
10406,This dress is really nice and lightweight the slip is snug so the outer part floats nicely butit adds a bit too much volume if you have a lot of curves it disguises in a way but also is a bit less flattering i really wanted to like it because its so breezy but a tad matronly on me,0
10407,This is the perfect jacket to throw on for errands around town picture doesnt do it justicevery unique and stylish love the threequarter sleeves for this time of year,1
10408,I am very petite however fuller on top ddd this top looks fabulous it is cut in such a way that every part of your body looks slimmer goes with jeans dress pants of skirt i highly recommend,1
10409,I know weve gotten to the point that polyester can be acceptable but sometimes its still that horrible texture unbreathable mess unfortunately thats what this top is made out of so it runs big its billowy and cute but i couldnt get it off quick enough because of the feel of the fabric,0
10410,I absolutely love this top i own it in coral and white it is simply beautiful and the linen fabric makes it comfortable and breathable i am so happy i bought this top,1

10414,This is a nice sleeveless button down the bee design is really fun but the colors make this more stylish than i would have thought i tried it on with a pair of white shorts with a half tuck and it looked great i can also see it paired with trousers or flared jeans nice addition i purchased the or xs my usual size in regular length and it was fine the stylist also showed me how to tied it in the front to wear with high waisted pants i am lbs for reference and dd,1
10415,This top is gorgeous i normally wear s to m depending on brand and style ordered a s and it was so small i returned and have l on order it is cropped i am and it hit me as pictured on model if you are tall or like longer tops this may not be for you,1
10416,The quality of this blouse is great a bit on the thick side which i like the fronts a bit shorter than the back looks great with joggers or jeans great neckline and design i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals love it,1
10417,I am here online to buy this pant in both colors i tried it on today in store in regular lengh but am opting for petite size i am i could have purchased the regular length which hit me above the ankle but i think p will be more flattering and better for summerthe pants are a woven material and kindof shiny the pants also may be a bit seethru in sunshine due to the structure of weave that said i am buying them anyways because they are that comfortable and professional i may,1

10421,I love skorts so when i saw this online i ordered my usual size arrived today really cute fit is good w some room to spare almost too big but ill stick w the looks as in the pic except the lower front part the back has a metallic sparkly fiber in the fabric not shown in the pic though its understated but attractive the fabric patches give this skort a special uniqueness casual or a little dressy just love,1
10422,After reading the other reviews i felt compelled to write one for this top it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store but a few weeks ago i had the pleasure i saw this top and while it was not on sale i had to have it yes it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous to be honest this is my favorite top in my closet right now i can dress it up or make it more casual and now that its on sale dont hesitate in this purchas,1
10423,Size down i love this item it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some,1
10424,I was extremely excited to receive these pants given the two positive reviews im a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions i sized down from my normal size to a and was swimming in these pants i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work im not sure if i received a defective pair or what but be cautious ordering these pants,0
10425,I am and tried this dress on in both a large and medium petite the dress is supposed to be a lose fit but i found that i was swimming in the large but the medium was perfect i bought it in a petite which is shorter for my comfort to wear alone but looks great with leggings and sandals for spring or with boots in the winter the embroidery is beautiful plus it has pockets first time i wore it i received tons of compliments,1
10426,Love these pants they look great with a pair of mid calf boots and a loose tshirt i usually wear a size or but went with a on these they are very flattering and edgy love them,1
10427,I love this dress it is an easy throw on and go dress the fabric is very soft and the cut is faltering fit is true to size,1

10429,I saw this dress on sale online and it was available at my local retailer i tried it on and went with the xs im lbs c and it fit great with some room tts the material is fabulous and it comes with a matching green slip which is great,1
10430,This is a great top i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite i ended up getting the moss and the gray i could have gotten either the xs or the s i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper,1
10431,I already knew that its not the lightest summer dress by reading previous reviewsyes it is fully lined with stretchy fabric which is kind of thick and heavy for skinny straps i still love this dress its very beautiful and versatile its perfect for san francisco summer it never gets too hot anyway the color is also beautiful but its little pink side of redi am size it fits perfect just like the picture,1
10432,These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier topaccessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around these are great for multiple seasons im so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by by design,1
10433,These pants are a really pretty color and feel nice on the fit was great and did not really shrink with washing i received a lot of compliments the first time i wore them,1
10434,I love jumpsuits for their style and comfort i loved the look of this blue silky piece and the review that said it was like lounge wear you could wear out of the house i agree that it is like lounge wear but for me there were a few challengesfirst the fit was small i am usually anywhere between a and a depending on style cut and brand i tried the small in this and it was not a flowy look or feel it was restrictive in the hip area in a way that would make me not want to wear th,0
10435,I rarely buy anything at full price at retailer but after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldnt handle the thought of not having this dress in my life im feet tall and a size so this was definitely a maxi on me but there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats im very pearshaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shoppingclothing add,1
10436,I loved this dress immediately it is soft to the touch and super comfortable i will be wearing this so much this summer the arms are true to size and the body is flowy and roomy but it is still flattering highly recommend,1
10437,Fabric is not as rich as shown in photo dress much shorter than shown in photo shoulder area is tight and really doesnt blend with the material below this isnt going to work on very many people pear shapejust not what ive come to expect from retailer,0
10438,I tried it one bcasue it is on sale and i love ittoo bad i dont need yet anothr black top fit is looseflowy but the ruffles add a littl cahrm to the shirt tried on regualr xs i could proably go to petites though but thankfully there is a button at the neck,1

10440,I love this top im lb and the small fits well probably could have fit in the xs it is more fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom i ordered it in orange and it is a very pretty peachy coral stripe highly recommend for a comfy top that can be dressed up a bit more than your average tshirt,1
10441,I love this shirt but it was huge i ordered a small and i was drowning in it unfortunately i had to return it,1
10442,At tall its hard to find pants that fit my inseam and these fit the bill i normally wear a or tall in pants from brands like ag or paige but i bought these in a tall as i find pilcro tends to run large they are soft and comfortable and dont stretch out sizes by the end of the day which is great they feel like leggings the wine color looks just like the images for those who find measurements helpful im tall lbs with about hips and a inseam,1

10447,This swing tee is amazing i bought the blue one and the color is true to what it looks like online the material is so soft and cozy i am typically an xs and bought an xs however it runs ever so slightly big if i had purchased the xxs it seems like the arms would have been to tight and im definitely not a fan of that whatever the case i highly recommend this tshirt and love its versatility and that i can wear this all year long,1
10448,I saw this dress but was hesitant to purchase it online because of the reviews i went to the absolutely fabulous new walnut creek store and though it wasnt on the floor they found one in my size in the storeroomi tried it on and was immediately enthralled i am and the dress flowed like a dream i will be wearing it for my anniversary celebration with pearls and victorian earrings i cant wait it is lovely you may need to be a little taller than average to wear this but it is wonder,1
10449,Im and and the fit comfortably i initially bought the but felt it was snug in the seat so switched out for the im so didnt want the painted on look they will need to be washed more frequently since they do stretch out as they are worn love the gray color and goes with so many fall colors,1
10450,As tshirts go this one has a flattering fitshapely waist yet not so tight that unwanted curves show i bought the striped one in my usual medium and it fits perfect now so will have to be careful when washing if it were available i would have tried the large so if youre a tad senitive about tight clothes i suggest upsizing its a nice weight fabric and the details around the v neck are greatthe v dips just like the photo approprialty sexy and age appropriate im at,1
10451,I love this dress it is a very casual and loose fit which makes it super comfortable i highly recommend it since it is versatile for fall and spring and can be styled quite a few ways,1

10454,I thought this suit would be the perfect solution of stylish but forgiving of my new mom bod this one didnt work for me i ordered the medium the top is very smalli would recommend only for b cup or smaller the full coverage bottoms did nothing for my shape it seemed to make me seem rounder and shorter sending this one back i did find success same size in a faux wrap style retailer suit,0
10455,I had shirts from clearance in my hand but put them back to get this shirt its perfect great with skinniessandals for the spring or bootsleggings for the fall great for layering and so versatilei will get more wear out of this than my clearance shirts combined i like the slit in the side it makes flowy while also preventing it from looking like a maternity shirt the only thing i would like is if the shirt was a little less seethrough its not bad but i will definitely have to,1
10456,I love these i adore tracy reese and these are my favorites they feel like pjs fit true to size and are just perfect for work im a teacher or for going casual very lightweight and not too hot for texas summers,1
10457,Im barely and rarely find a maxi that isnt far too long or the other extreme i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising inches from the floor for example this one is perfect with flat sandals i tried on the and chuckled bc it was too long tried on the and not only was it the perfect length the bodice fit like a glove i would say im average bust size always fluctuating but not generally flatchested i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an,1
10458,I bought the first one in the gold color which i call mustard i really love the highlow style and looks great when worn with a long necklaces when they went on sale i bought two more black and grey i love that they are perfect for layering when its cold but that i can also wear them alone in other seasons thy ran a bit large for me so i was able to purchase the small i am small boned but large in the bust im also short but they dont look too long especially when i wear,1

10462,I wanted this coat from the first moment i saw it in the catalogue i tend to gravitate toward dark colors but this looked timeless and beautiful like something my grandmother would have cherished and i would have coveted i was not disappointed the coat is carefully lined and the mohair is divinely soft the silhouette is not fitted but comes off surprisingly chic do note that this is not a coat for heavy duty weather ive even been a bit chilly wearing it at nights in la also heed t,1
10463,I love the cut of this dress i can see how some would not like the way the arms are cut i love the pockets and the way this dress flows when you walk it it its very fun to wear i am wearing it to an awards show and was a little worried it may be too casual but the texture and weight of the fabric make it look more dressy i will be getting a lot of mileage out of this dress,1
10464,I bought the first skirt at the store loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too,1
10465,I love the weight of this shirt and the open scoop neck really flattering i wear tanks under my shirts anyway but it is see through the weight is nice even in heat and i expect it to be so nice layering in the winter the cut at the hem is great very flattering and does not seem to clingi bought a white one now i have repurchased another white xs and a black one while i was vacillating theblack xs sold out so i got a small and will cross my fingers that its not too big,1
10466,I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated dont hesitate buy this shirt you wont be sorry,1
10467,I was skeptical when i saw it online i was not sure about the white background but it had good reviews and the cut seemed to be what i looked for so i gave it a try and ordered online i ordered s and xs i was really surprised how well this dress fits i am and about lbs pear shape the fabric is thicker and lined but not too heavy the cut is slimming flattering and structured i decided to keep the xs size i hope i can find more dresses like this one in retailer,1

10472,I purchased this dress in pink it is absolutely beautiful the shimmery detail around the neck is gorgeous it is so flattering and looks amazing with boots or sandals this dress will not disappoint,1
10473,I got these in gray like other reviewers mentioned the waist is a little higher not s though but the jean had great control so it holds everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do contours to the leg love it,1
10474,I read the previous reviews but decided to try it out since retailer was having off sale itemsit looks very flattering on me and great fit for my body typei would recommend,1
10475,I gave this top stars for the embroidery and fit around the chestshoulders i wish this top was a little longer as the xsmall was just too short im and run longwaisted the small fit better in lengththe way it does on the model,1
10476,What a welldesigned dress the cut is a slight aline without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather the neck is pretty wide as others have noted but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent it does run a little large im lbs and went with the xsp,1
10477,This shirts dresses up anythingtights jeans or a skirt love the color and the length,1
10478,I love fitted top dresses like this but i find them hard to fit well on my body this one fit perfectly straps can be let out or taken in easily and i get tons of comments on the print,1
10479,The material is thin and of poor quality it snagged the first time i wore it the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated,0
10480,I bought this top in the black motif and it is easily one of my new go to tops can wear it to brunch work and happy hours it always looks good such a great buy,1
10481,I love this jumpsuiti would like to first say that while a gorgeous model i actually think this piece looks even better on different body shapes sizing i love the shape the style and the comfort i tried it on in a dressing room where it turns out another woman was trying it as well i am and usually wear a or and got the small she was a bit shorter and pettte and it looked fabulous on her it is loose all over and so flow and fabulous it hits me where it hits the mod,1
10482,As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection i can dress it up or down it is really soft and great quality i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long,1
10483,These jeans are amazing i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since i have washed them once the tag says to turn inside out wash in cold and hang dry i was a little skeptical that theyd still be soft without the dryerdryer sheets but they are wonderful and do not stretch out i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors theyre very comfortable i totally love the high rise theyre a little long but i,1
10484,This top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms youre going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out its made of a light weight linencotton fabric its very soft and doesnt wrinkle as easily as most linen does it feels soft on the skin lightweight and has a nice bounce to it its,1
10485,This shirt is adorablebutit didnt work for meim a smaller gal with a large chest g i tried on the small since it seemed so flowy and large the sleeves were tight yet the back of the shirt flowed way too much making the shirt look huge on me perhaps a more fitted back and i would have been in lovelove the blue color,0
10486,This shirt is really cute its shorter than most and its supposed to be that way if you dont want your midriff showing if you stretch this shirt isnt for you it has slits on the side also the material is super light so will be great for summer i just loved the way it fit and that its different i ordered an xs and im about and lbs,1
10487,These are incredibly soft and comfortable they are only for inside lounging because they are a bit see through and have that longjohns type of material on it,1

10492,I have this color also in the grey flattering interesting shirt i have think hips but a fuller waist the vertical lines of this shirt design suggest otherwise great to pair with torn up skinny jeans love the petite line now in portland,1
10493,I couldnt believe the bargain price of these leggings so i took a chance and ordered all colors when they arrived i was equally pleased to see how soft cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops also interesting is that the textures of all are different the black has a vertical lined texture the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured wearing them is going to be a pleasure,1
10494,I love the look on this dress feels great for a romantic night out or for a party,1
10495,Just got this top and i love it its color is more saturated in person which i like more of a pinkypurple very sweet and feminine i still have a bit of a mommy tummy and the style hides that pretty well its very soft and comfortable as well overall happy with this top,1
10496,This is so pretty for summer it is very lightweight and flattering on the color was a little brighter than i expected but it is still beautiful,1
10497,Beautiful dress skims the body perfectly and flatters the silky and breathable fabric is everything its made of cupro used as a silk substitute but breathes like cotton uniqlo uses it in their airism products which makes it perfect for summer weather i wore it to a summer barbecue dressed down with a denim shirt tied at the waist and simple jewelry but can easily dress it up with a chunky heeled sandal and statement jewelry its gorgeous get it the colors of the fabric a,1
10498,As a tall girl i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs they are amazing for dressing up or sassing up and outfit i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them however as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor after wearing them to they symphony the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat i really dont see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved im sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants,0
10499,Love the suit i ordered two sizes and this ended up being too small im xx and d and there wasnt enough support in the bust read a lot of mixed reviews regarding sizing on the seafolly suits so im glad i got two suit is flattering and i love the coverage in the bottom some boyshort suits are cheeky but these are not like that only complaint is that while there is a pocket for the cups they are sewn on top,1
10500,I bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if its a color you wouldnt normally wear the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath im looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweaterim a f and size fit me easily with extra room under the arms the gathering stops above the bust so that it fits snug above and loose below worn loose the blouse is fairly long coverin,1
10501,The cut is small i am lbs and usually wear medium pants medium in these is too fitted on my hips and rearthe polyester will be hot in summer returning for another brand,0
10502,I could not resist this top it is super cute the material is nice and thick you can get away with wearing no bra shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection i cant wait to wear this i think the cut is very flattering for all figures top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though,1
10503,This sweater is absolutely adorable i was worried about the layers looking too frumpy but they were not i normally wear a size medlum but i sized down on this sweater on a gut feeling and bought a small i didnt want it to be too loose or billowy and it fits perfectly will be so cute with jeans but also with skirts for work you will be so happy you bought this one,1
10504,Im a little heavier than id like due to postpartum fluff and have to gradually lose because of breastfeeding so i look for bottoms with enough give in the waist that will still fit once i reach my goal weight for reference im about waist x hips with a goal of waist x hips so roughly a size getting back to an i bought a medium and it stretches enough to fit this skirt is a solid staple and the colors are just lovely the flat elastic in the waistband doesnt rol,1
10505,I am obsessed with denim and have two other pairs of ag jeans from retailer that i am very happy with my recent preference has been for highrise skinny jeans and decided to give these a try because of the versatile medium wash when i tried these on in my normal size they were so cute that i bought them fullpriced i could tell that the material was pretty stretchy which is what makes them soft and comfortable but was not expecting them to stretch out and sag after a few hours by th,0
10506,This is a beautifully designed jacket that everyone will love and wont want to take off i went with the gray wool i always worry about jackets that are too snug as i am busty but this fit is superb the arms are unusually long though maybe this is good for you i had a dressmaker shorten my sleeves by one inch so now its perfect for me i bought the regular medium my usual size size or medium top f i tend to wear my blazers and jackets open but its nice to know that i can but,1
10507,I bought this on a whim i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit especially online this suit is structured so well the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher the material i feel holds in my stomach i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece,1
10508,My review is of the black motif no longer listed online but i saw a bunch in the clearance sock bin at the georgetown dc store today i love beautiful and unique socks so i thought id give these a chance i like them so much that i bought more pairs of the exact same sock now that theyre on saletwo things i noticed the way the sock is knit when you put it on it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas it is sort of a stretched slightly twotone look,1
10509,Fits great not too tightbaggy pattern on shirt is pretty and should work for layering or wearing on its own,1
10510,Wore it this weekend and the compliments were overflowing its exceptionally flattering for busty women im a dd i had to size down from an to a but even the looked good just a bit loose in the bodice v neck is just right not too low not too high print is gorgeous in person colors are much richer than the online photo the flowy skirt is very slimming and forgiving for hourglass and pear shaped body types but if you have slim hips you might feel like youre swimming in fabr,1
10511,A great everyday tee dress it up a bit with a great gold necklace looks nice with jeans and brown boots,1
10512,Yes i am lbs and busty this hugs in the right places there is no extra fabric so it doesnt appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well this fits beautifully the denim color is just like the picture the sleeves are a tad long so i just rolled them up no bulk i ordered a size petite,1
10513,I ordered the coralpeach version in size it ran small especially compared to other size or maeve blouses ive purchased very tight throughout the blouse the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived the material was extremely cheap in quality it wrinkled terribly the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet the idea of this was perfect for my style unfortunately the poor choice in material poor fit made this a return for me,0
10514,This dress is amazing i have a b cup and didnt quite fill out the top enough but that is a small tailoring fix i am completly in love with this dress and recommend it highly,1
10515,This is such a cute and flattering top it isnt a style i would normally gravitate to but i liked the color so i thought id try it on i ended up trying on the medium because they were out of my usual large and it fits great it drapes really nicely and looks super cute with jeans and booties the little stripe of ladder lace around the middle is a bit see thru but not revealing its a nice top for transitioning from summer to fall,1
10516,First i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic but actually im glad i didnt know because i love it it does not look cheap and it really works the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough the real issue for me is the size i ordered the small and it is huge enormous especially from the back the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so its almost a bat wing kind of thing and,1
10517,This dress is cute i ordered my regular xs which was too large but liked it enough to exchange for an xs petite and hopefully the fit will be better the xs was much too wide and came past my knee im and for reference the grey is very pretty and is blueish gray very misty and unique the pockets are awesome and i like that its lined in a fine poly that shouldnt cling to tights etc in the winter if you can find a size that fits you buy it,1
10518,The shirt fits loosely but not baggy beautiful detail on the back and shoulders very soft and lovely material,1
10519,These leg warmers are perfect for me they are long enough and thick and warm enough to keep me from freezing in cold weather great for people with large calves,1
10520,Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip,1
10521,I agree with the previous comments the vest runs a little large so you can easily size down for a more formfitting fit it is so soft and the colors are lovely will be a welcome addition when the weather turns a little cooler i am so glad i purchased this vest,1
10522,I read the existing reviews before purchasing and a few mentioned that this sweater ran large this has been my experience with most tops i have purchased from retailer i figured by ordering a medium i would receive a slightly loose to moderately loose fitting sweater this was not the case the sweater is short does not look anything like it does when you view the model from behind and i assume the model is taller than ias models are usually tall for reference i am medium build,0
10523,Bought this shirt in the black runs tts very comfortable and flattering past left of center shirts in this stylefabric seem to run a little large but i bought this in my usual retailer m and its great very similar to last years style but perhaps a tad more fitted i gave it a for quality bc i have noticed a little bit of pilling under the arm area but overall it holds up pretty well,1
10524,Just to back up what everyone else is saying this poncho is perfect it is indeed super soft casual and fun i personally thought the coloring at the bottom was even prettier than pictured this poncho is not tight around the neck yet not lose it goes right over your head without messing up your hair i love the sleeves they can be worn above the elbow or easily pulled just down below it a great alternative to a sweater i ordered the petite xss and im hits right at bum,1
10525,First off this top is super cozy i adore an easy top that has beautiful detail and this one does the fabric is a lot like a thermal shirt but not too warm its very stretchy not sure if it will stretch out with wear but you could easily size down the body has a ton of room because of the cute cut you could wear it oversized without it drowning you or you could size down to keep it more slim the lace is simple and even more beautiful in person i highly recommend this one especia,1
10526,The photos do not do this gorgeous dress justice the iridescent material makes it perfect for a fancy date night and i received complements from complete strangers would also be great as a wedding guest or bridesmaid dress,1
10527,I am and about lbs curvy through hips small up top and i got a small and it fit great i got it in the wine and it is a pretty color for fall into winter the fabric is super soft and cozy,1
10528,I saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on it fits perfectly im usually a size with dresses and the small fit perfectly it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time layered over say a black turtle neck and black tights but i think it can also be worn in the spring especially with that flower print,1
10529,This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like im not wearing a bra at all except i have the gentle support i need the material is very thin and the pink color is see through so not recommended under a white or see through shirt perfect for sleeping or lounging in,1
10530,Top feels like pajamas but looks very classy the sweater material is so soft i wear it with a blazer over the top and i get so many compliments on it wish they had it in more colors must have,1
10531,While contemplating on purchasing these pants after receiving them quality was superb waffle material spandex beautiful green color and snaps in the front zipper and front and back pockets material has alot of give and wide legs these pants dont come to the ankle so dont expect it sort of like capri but longer lose fitting and wide legs nice addition to my closet i hit the jackpot now and again w this store,1
10532,This sweater is so soft and warm and i love it with the matching leggings i say it is true to size however i ordered it a size up so that it covers the bottomcrotch area when i am wearing the leggings normally wear an xs ordered a small and it works well it is very well made i absolutely love it,1
10533,I tried this shirt and really loved the feel and the scalloped sleeves i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery and i always find myself drawn to their clothing the fit wasnt too boxy on me but im between ml and sized down so that might have helped if i didnt have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up,1
10534,I ordered the black and red check leggings thanks to the suggestion of the retailer stylists online there is no way in a million years that i would have picked these out due to my body shape im petite size and pounds and feet tall i ordered a petite small i do not have skinny legs and ordered these anyway they are so flattering that im thinking of ordering the grey pair the red pair are kind of darker the picture makes the red look so much bright than they really are trust me yo,1
10535,Super soft pretty blue green color packs super well for traveling,1
10536,Omg i also bought this years ago i have worn it every year and get compliments on it every day im so excited to buy it again i might actually buy just love it,1
10537,This tank is so classic and summery and i never want to take it off its very soft and the fabric is decently thick it hangs away from the body and has a nice swing to it it works well for my very straight figure and small chest but finding the right fit might be problematic for someone more blessed in the chest area than me,1
10538,Fell in love with the dress at the first sign yes have to confess that i always love white dresses but this dress is not only beautiful on the picture but also very pretty to put on material is natural gentle on my skin style is simple romantic and it goes well with almost everything to dress up or dress down very comfortable to wear good for a long moonlight beach walksize runs large have to get petite xxs and it fits perfectly normally i go with petite for a fitted dress,1
10539,Beautiful cobalt blue dressi wore it for christmas and had many compliments,1
10540,I love this romper its really flattering and well made at most stores i wear a medium but normally at retailer i wear a small i had to exchange the small for a medium but other than i really loved it,1
10541,This looks nothing like it does on the website it runs small and the colors are so muddy it doesnt drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short stiff and plain ugly sent it back immediately,0
10542,I just got this in the mail absolutely gorgeous the hook and eye closure is very secure i have no problem walking or sitting in this dress i ordered a aize going by the previous reviews that this dress ran small i could have ordered my normal but the fits pretty goodjust a tad big the dress is more chocolate brown than black and the detail is really stunning you cant find unique dresses like this anymore truly beautiful,1
10543,Love these jeans they are the perfect fit from waist to ankles their first wear was like id been wearing them for years i paired them with the pintuck buttondown tunic,1
10544,Kicky looking pants that i got at a bargain basement steal id be kicking myself if i didnt buy them cant wait to wear them once it warms up theyll look great with a lightweight boxy sweater and flats i tried on the and the and the is perfect the fabric has a nice fluid feel to it i always swore to my husband id never wear plaids but i guess i lied,1
10545,These pants are great i am and lbs i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms medium fits well except knee pit area maybe because they are not very stretching fabric however they are still flattering the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines,1
10546,This has such a beautiful shape goes with so many things and has gotten a lot of compliments already my favorite new piece,1
10547,Saw this on sale and tried it not expecting anything and wound up loving it i am and it covers my thighs and rear well so i can wear it with leggings it came mid thigh on me the red is a rich burnt orangered i love that is is mostly cotton so i wont get overheated,1
10548,This is a gorgeous dress the fabric has the look of linen though it is not and the lining is a soft mesh looks both relaxed and stylish,1
10549,Such a cute shirt i picked up the whitewithflowers that is not being shown online yet the straight white looks like it could wrinkle and definitely needs a tank underneath but the white with flowers was not seethrough and seems like it will require a bit less steaming the detail masks wrinkles the flowereddesign also has a small tie at the neck that i dont think was on the solid color design cant totally remember cute extra detail but not overly obvious it blends into the shirt,1
10550,I am in love with pilcro pants i am typically a petite or im a in these khakis which is could have them in every color and style,1
10551,I loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly the arm holes are entirely too big so big that alternations couldnt fix it maybe its because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw,0
10552,I got the moss and love the color the style and size in p is perfect for my short self very comfy for work now i need more colors,1
10553,I really like this dress i wasnt sure what to expect when i ordered it but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived it fits well and its very cute and different,1
10554,I saw online and bought in white and moss moss is darker in person i am but a f and the top fits very well it actually minimized my chest which i love not sure how well this would fit on smallchested ladies not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts super happy,1
10555,Loved the look of this shirt online i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated almost looks as if im ready for take off unfortunately none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size i would have loved it looks great from the side but sadly i cant walk around like that,0
10556,Beautiful soft flattering but not clingy i bought in the green which is not a typical color in the summer palate which makes it all the more appealing,1
10557,Bought this in the turquoise color and it is awesome for those worried about it being seethrough im wearing a black bra and you cant see it its the perfect weight super bummed that the green is sold out but may check in stores,1
10558,Nice modern print vibrant colors and not sheer no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot,1
10559,I originally bought this jacket in a medium but the sleeves were a bit long and overall fit a little big i decided to exchange for a small and i am so glad i did this jacket feels great and the sleeves hit at just the right spot in the small size i normally wear a,1
10560,This sweater is gorgeous the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer and i tend to wear petites the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind,1
10561,This sweatshirt is really nice its oversized so best worn with leggings or skinny jeans its very warm without being too thick it looks almost exactly like the picture the quality seems pretty good but well see how it holds up after its washed,1
10562,The turqoise color is pretty however it did smell bad out of the package i wore it once and it transferred the dye to my skin and white pants bra and cami hope it all comes out in the wash i tried to hand wash the shirt and now have blue hands and a blue tub,0
10563,This ribbed henley is incredibly soft youll love the way it feels but it does run a little small so id recommend getting one size up if you dont want it to be too form fitting,1
10564,This skirt has a beautiful flattering feminine fit the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and of course the layers are what make this piece a stunner i highly recommend it can see wearing this all year dressed up with jewels or down with boots and a casual sweater,1
10565,I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare i am and wear a size they fit comfortably with great stretch but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch you will wear holes through the thighs in very short orderfirst they started piling which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before and within washes i could actually see through the f,0
10566,Fits perfectly super soft and wellmade love the sleeves and back drop i can expect i will wear a lot in this coming fallwinter season in ca highly recommend,1
10567,I got this in a medium its really big i added a belt and ir looks alot better the medium seems like a large im a size or should have gotten a small now they are out will use the medium with a belt,1
10568,I am in love with this top it is so feminine and cute i wear it with skinny jeans and tall boots and feel so pretty i got the cream color i wish there were more solid colors i usually wear a medium which is what i ordered and i love how it fits i like flowy tops so it is perfect please make solid colors,1
10569,This was a last minute addition to my online order to hit the free shipping anyway this ended up being my favorite item from my order i love the way it wraps and also lays open i didnt realize that the fabric was a mix of two different knits but i think it adds nice interest i ordered the redwhich is a nice deep rednot an obnoxious fire engine red its very complimentary to my skin tone and dark hair i run between a small and medium but chose the medium since it looked like it c,1
10570,Such a festive sweater and ive received many compliments anytime i wear it unique and fun to wear,1
10571,I was so excited to get this dress i need it for a wedding and i thought i had hit the jackpot the dress arrived with a small tear the seams are puckered and badly seen for an almost dress the quality is terrible i expect better from retailer im so disappointed,0
10572,Purchased this shirt for holiday photos and it worked great very flattering and a fun take on plaid more feminine than your classic plaid button down,1
10573,Gorgeous dress and very flattering but it does run quite small in the bust im dd and even the shoulder area i rarely have problems there i also find the side zipper a pain sized up from a p to a p the lace detail is especially beautiful and the color is more peachy than pink the print quite saturated and not too pastel for early fall i can see wearing it for seasons at least in ca,1
10574,This is a lightweight sweatergood for the office and summer evenings here in so cal its a good weight sweater year round love the lace trim runs a bit large but not too bad color is a light cornflower blue not lavender this works for me but if youre looking for a lavender sweater you might want to think twice,1
10575,This top is beautifully made and designedmaterial is soft and comfortable however its very boxy the details on the side stick outi just found it not very flattering for me,0
10576,I am in love with this bathing suit it is super cute and flattering and i love the pattern on this specific style it is also seems to be very well made i havent worn it in the water yet so i cant really speak to that i would say that i believe it is true to size which means that it is a little tight since bathing suits need to be tight to stay on in the water for reference i am a bra size dd around pounds and and a size fits perfectly,1
10577,Well fitted kinda slouchy sweater matches photo and product description looking forward to cooler temps,1
10578,I am not particularly large but i have thighs this pair of pants was totally unflattering my butt looked fine but everything else looked bigger and my legs looked like stumps i now understand why its on sale you may like these pants if you are tall and thin legged but otherwise skip them plus the material seems like it would discolor or stain easily i had a pair from retailer in the same material last year that developed an odd discoloration the first time i wore them,0
10579,I cannot believe how different this top looks in person i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women the cut is not too low and lays beautifully,1
10580,This top runs extremely large and has a very unflattering cut for those without a straight figure i have ddd boobs and a muscular curvy frame this top adds about lbs,0
10581,I was on the fence about purchasing this dress for a while and finally took the plunge glad i did because this dress is stunning and very comfortable i ordered an xsp and it was the perfect length originally i had also considered xxsp while it fit well above the waist it was slightly too short for reference im ft inches pounds,1
10582,These pants are a great fit perfect for the inbetween seasons casual comfortable but look very nice and polished when worn a practical steal at retailers sale prices,1
10583,I love this jacket i have not worn it yet as the weather is still very warm but i am looking forward to wearing this a lot this fall the cropped cut is very flattering and the vegan leather very soft i followed the other reviews and ordered one size up and its perfect i am normally a size and went with he medium the plum color is quite neutral in person i also love the printed lining i did notice quite a few long threads around the lining sewing i hope this is just an overlooked pos,1
10584,This cardi is cuter in the stock photos in person the colors are a bit more drab stock photos also dont show quite how much of a swing shape this has it is very soft though returned it,0
10585,I got the shirt the cami and the shorts and they are all great super comfortable fabric really well made and really cute love them all,1
10586,Absolutely love this shirt i purchased this in the black and blue perfect for holiday parties,1
10587,This dress is great for work and play i bought a l and a xl both fit well but the sleeves in the large were quite tight so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose this dress looks great on i wish the material was a little higher quality but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline,1
10588,This skirt sparkles when you wear it beautiful in winter it is made well great design and fit true to size it is a beautiful fabric with deep blue flowers stitched in as well as soft silvery gold thread sewn into the background great length too fabulous,1
10589,I love this sweater it is classic but has details that make it fresh and different the tie in the back offers very interesting detail,1
10590,I ordered an extra small it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up ive tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels really a cute and versatile sweater i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful this one works perfectly for me however,1
10591,Light weight and cotton great summer top runs a little big but it suits me im short and find the straps a drop loose because theyre a fixed length meant for someone a little taller than me but they are not falling down so far also if you look at the photo of the model wearing the top in black you can see through the lace to the bra underneath if you just wear a bra the same color as the top its not at all noticeable great piece for summer,1
10592,I love this top the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night the small fits me perfect and i dont wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned but might if i wore it to work,1
10593,This was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on love it fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way colors are great got the petite size the pattern is different for each one so each is unique mine has lot more navy blue,1
10594,This is one of the cutest jackets i have ever owned nice soft material i have a steamer so wont have to iron this depends on how picky youd be about that great cut ordered my normal size sending another jacket back that luckily i hadnt worn yet i know between the two i will always pick this one didnt find the sleeves too long which was good as no petite option seriously so excited to wear this,1
10595,I love this top i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges so i figured id take a chance it is gorgeous and not too big the quality is fabulous and the color is very soft and complimentary i am so glad i ordered this cant wait to wear it,1
10596,Love it cute flattering and even though the material is thin it is still very cozy i have no complains about the quality i havent found any loose threads or other issuesthe cardigan runs tts i got m instead of my usual s because s was out of stock and its a little loose in the armpits but i still like the cardigan and im keeping it,1
10597,I loved the design of this blouse and ordered it the first day it was available unfortunately i was disappointed on arrival besides being more muted colorwise the sizing is way off i ordered the xxsp and it was huge on me on the model it looks like it skims the body when in reality it falls like a tent i tried tucking it into a skirt but there was just too much fabricthough the neck worked for me i can see how it might be too small for some people as it is very narrow also it,0
10598,I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric but its fine the neutral color is a little bland but i can wear it with bright pants since i expected it to run large i ordered a small the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream plus it looks amazing from the back,1
10599,This is a great summer skirt that is good for work or casual wear the fabric is soft and the colors go with most anything one downside is it wrinkles easily,1
10600,I love swing dresses but they never seem to work out for me however lately i have been trying on swing tops like this one and they are super scores i love this top in my store they had a rack of test materials where they dont have the full line but they have a look at some online features or clothes that are very new releases this was on the rack i knew it wasnt my size but i tried it on anyway and i am absolutely in love i am waiting for a sale as always but i am going to get this i,1
10601,This is the perfect dress to take traveling dress it up with heels or down with sandals warm up and wear it with a short black sweater a nice easy elegant dress size small fit nicely medium probably would have been fine too,1
10602,I ordered the xxs p as this dress is not a fitted dress and that was the right size for me only thing is the length is a bit linger still lower on calf for me the straps are almost tight so i would say the dress is a reversed taper shape color is beautiful i ordered green as the other color plum doesnt have petite available green is rich and classy the fabric is surprisingly soft i love the little details in the velvet definitely need a strapless bra for this one lbsm d,1
10603,I love wearing sweaters when it gets cooler out but hate the bulkiness that comes with them this is a super cute sweater that isnt too bulky and gives you the sexiness youre looking for great material,1
10604,Better than the picture i like the layered look and the texture of the fabric great top,1
10605,I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim it is so much cuter in person than it looks online i wouldnt have given it a second look based on these pictures it perhaps runs a tiny bit large but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did if youre thin you may want to size down i have a decent amount of padding that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted lbs the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu,1
10606,Love these pants its hard to get really dark dark black jeans with a little stretch and these are perfect i also like the cut as a bit of a change from skin tight leggings and the fabric is super cool like a lightweight brocade denim i get compliments every time i wear them,1
10607,This jacket is amazing i at first bought the medium because that is what i usually wear on top when it arrived in the mail i put it on asap it fit but was definitely too form fitting to wear a sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath so i called the store and asked them to reserve a large and that one fit perfectly its loose enough to wear something underneath but not so loose that it looks to big it is so soft and cozy and the hood is my favorite part,1
10608,I love the oversized look of this jacketmy building is kept freezing cold so while at work i am constantly fiddling with cardigans and scarves and a space heater to try to keep from freezing while working and i thought this jacket would be a great jacket that basically functions as a blanket while still looking professional my boyfriend doesnt quite get the length sleeves but that definitely keeps the look of this jacket polishedif they were longer i think it would be too much just li,1
10609,The quality and fabric of this dress are lovely but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless it fit me like a sack i ordered the m and i suppose i shouldve sized down but even in the s im afraid this would be far too large for reference i am and lbs i have a curvy build so this shape dress just wasnt right on me i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure returned,0
10610,This may be the most beautiful top ive ever purchased from retailer gorgeous classy comfortable and oneofakind i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it runs large buy a smaller size than you usually wear you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top i wear it on the shoulders a perfect,1
10611,Saying that these pants are comfortable would be redundant they are over above in comfort i wear a size and they are right on in sizing i want to comment on the colorprint to see the green i had to take the pants by a window with natural light and look closely that being said i think the pants take on the color of top one chooses i walked through my closet with the pants in hand they match with light grey periwinkle blue light sky blue navy white your choice i do prefer a so,1
10612,Just received these this morning and so happy cartonnier always makes a substantial quality product might run a little largedepends how roomy you want them lovely colors and perfect length wish they came in other colors,1
10613,This sweater is really beautiful i love this brand and this piece is one of their best yet the fringe is perfect and flowy a sweater that you can team with jeans and boots and be the best dressed in the room tts soft with no itch really happy i bought it and because of the color and weight this is an all year sweater which i love because i know i will not want to pack it away it fits just like the photo,1
10614,This dress is amazing its perfect for a casual family or friend get together or a fall dress with boots the back ties to make it more flattering than just a shift dress quality of the dress is great and the material is very versatile,1
10615,I love this shirt the front is a little shorter than i thought it would be but overall it is so cute and comfy wish they had it in more colors,1
10616,I was excited to see this sweater in my local store i have been coveting it online it was just as pretty in person as i hoped it would be the color is vivid and beautiful i loved the buttons down the back i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small i tried it on and liked the way it fit i wanted a snugger look i think the small would have worked too just a looser feelthe fabric is very soft now just waiting for cooler weather so i can wear it,1
10617,Really loved this so soft and snuggly was unsure about ordering shirt size s or jacket size for layering m ordered a small fits perfect definitely wouldnt have wanted the medium lbs for reference love this one great find,1
10618,Loved the look of this sweater online was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price knew it was definitely going back,0
10619,This is a nice simple understated sweater i got the green and the navy and they look different enough to keep both its a throwitonoverashirt sweater with the right length to let whatever is underneath show and the ribbon tie on the back is a nice touchi also like that the width of the sweater is an alternative to everything thats cut so tightly fitted its a nice width with some room without being boxy,1
10620,This is a gorgeous bathing suit the colours are more brilliant than the ones in the picture and much more beautiful comfortable chic and unique,1
10621,The material is so soft and the design makes it a little more fancy so you can dress this tank up or down its definitely an instant favorite and the color blue is a beautiful rich blue,1
10622,As a busty but smallwaisted girl i normally would not wear a loose shift like this however it turned out to be perfect for hiding my earlymid pregnancy belly the dress is extremely comfortable and it will also come in handy in the postpartum months in fact it looks so cute that i might just add it to my regular wardrobe after all,1
10623,I grabbed my typical size and found it fit snug in the bust the fabric has plenty of stretch so the snugness was fine especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front its lowcut but i didnt feel particularly exposed i ended up not buying it because i dont think it fit my body right the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole,0
10624,I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious the fit is absolutely incredible i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well it hugs your body in all the right places i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering gorgeous dress,1
10625,This dress is very flattering and well made i can hardly wait to wear it its one of my favorite retailer purchases,1
10626,I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed i am and i usually wear a size small top and dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasnt expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad i was so upset it also has thin silver lines through it which for me m,0
10627,Ive received so many complements on this top its so comfortable and every time i wear it someone compliments the color i ordered it in each color,1
10628,This shirt is amazing the pictures on the model do not do the shirt justice the shirt is a bit longer in person than shown on the model the colors are also more vibrant the material is so soft and has great flow i am excited to dress it up for work with a pencil skirt and have the option to wear with skinnies and a cute sandal on my off days,1
10629,I agree with the other reviews its a little small in the arms low cut in the chest but really broad in the shoulders i bought the xsp which is a size up from my normal xxsp they didnt have xxsp to compare and i am a small person with big athletic shoulders and my usual problem is with things being tight in the shoulders and fit everywhere else overall an excellent buy at the sale price size up for more room in the chest and arms,1
10630,I saw this one for the first time today instore and was not impressed it is a lacey material with an underlayer so with a different cut other than a swing dress i would have fallen in love and it would have been absolutely gorgeous unfortunately i did not like the swing dress cut especially not in white i wasnt sure if the designer was going for a throw back to the s or a shortened version of my grandmothers wedding gown but either way it was not working for me to be fair swing dr,0
10631,This shirt looked so perfect on the model and i was so excited to get it when i received it it was so soft and the color was so vibrant the only thing is its too big it kind of looks like a maternity shirt it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me but im happy with it other than that im normally a lxl but m would have been perfect this time,1
10632,Love this dress it is airy lightweight and comfortable the kind of dress im sure i will wear all summer long from the pics online i thought the sleeves would have embroidered detail however it was just the print of the fabric i like it just the same it comes with a slip underneath so it swings nicely i ordered it in both a s and xs there is plenty of fabric and it is not at all clingy so the xs was fine excited to wear it,1
10633,This dress in the blue motif has a really flattering fit and look the dress especially in this color hides the belly area well and does not make you look wide if you are heavier in the bottom half it is not too short and goes past my knee i am the material is also really soft and the dress is easy to pull on,1
10634,The cut and color of the dress is awesome however the biggest flaw is the zipper i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper brokesad day especially at the price there also were a number of loose threads i recommend waiting until it goes on sale youll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper,0
10635,I love love this top it looks just like the picture on model the front is a soft tshirt and the back is so cute and flattering super unique and comfortable style i am and xs fits perfect,1
10636,Wanted to love this dress pretty fabric and colors i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman im ordered a s this just looked like a nightgown on me sorry to say its going back,0
10637,This dress is even more amazing in person the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance the kimono like sleeves have the same details especially nice for toastingbe aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee a surprise but still quite lovely the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected,1
10638,Looked really cute on the hanger so i took it with me into the dressing room the fabric is super soft and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short you cant tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think youd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer i wish i could pull this offmaybe im just too old for it,0
10639,This jacket is perfect the denim mixed with the military style is such a good combo it fits great and is very comfortable the little ties in the back are a cute addition,1
10640,Upon opening this top i thought for sure it was going to be too s mall but it stretches nicely and is gorgeous when on it is a little thin and you have to be careful that its not too tight or you can see skin through the knots but i love this shirt i got the xs which is my usual size i could probably have used the s but didnt want to pay for shipping to exchange it as i dont have a store anywhere near me and the xs was fine,1
10641,This is a great top i love the color of the pink it is the perfect color of pink not too bright or too light but a pretty pinkcoral spring color i am fair skinned and this color looks great oni got the regular and it fits perfect i am and lbs i usually get petite but i cant imagine this shirt being shorter its a great length i can wear it slightly tucked in or out without it looking sloppy it also hides any belly issues for those mamas out there love it perfect fo,1
10642,I originally bought the tan at the store i loved it so much and ordered the red but went down a size as it does run big perfect for the summer,1
10643,The sweater is comfortable and a good weight the zipper is very difficult but i do not have to unzip the sweater to pull it on,1
10644,So i usually find that retailer tops run large everywhere else im a medium but im always a small at retailer but with pants or slacks im usually an and i always have to size up in retailer to a but based on some of the other runs large reviews i stuck with my normal size and they fit perfectly super cute not lined but the material has a nice weight to it so that doesnt bother me will def be wearing to the office,1
10645,I too will be returning this sweater love the style shape and fabric but after one wearing it has pilled terribly and now looks old and cheap,0
10646,This top is adorable runs a bit small but so cute worth the price and tons of compliments,1
10647,I loved this sweater when i saw it online and ordered right away i purchased a s and the fit was very off the arms were long which i dont mind but the sweater was also super heavy and bulky so it was not at all flattering i really wanted to love it and it seemed to be of good quality but it i had to return it,0
10648,I wore this with a velvet mosscolored skirt also sold at retailer that hits above knee and received so many compliments the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist sleeves hit above wrist as well,1
10649,My favorite for work or going out the perfect black shirt,1
10650,Loved this vest when i tried it on in the store and ordered it during the last sale i usually wear a medium and the xss fit much better than the ml getting excited for fall now if the weather would cooperate so i can wear this cute new vest,1
10651,These paige skinny jeans are lightweight snug super soft and extremely flexible allowing for tons of movement great for dressing up or down and a great addition to any ladies closet,1
10652,So nice lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs will look stylish on all heights very impressed with the styling and construction fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage,1
10653,Wow this sure is close fitting as in suction cups to your body yikes definitely not forgiving for those of us with curves to me it seems like the material will wear well i bought this for a great sales price so i may keep it not sure it would work fine as a layering piece but if i gain even lbs it wont work i ordered the medium and am usually a small the large might have worked best but probably still pretty clingy i do recommend this if you are thin with no problem areas,0
10654,I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly it fits me very well im b waist hips the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model i like the vneck the most because the ruffles are not too much and its not too low cut i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and its brighter for springsummer i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish by the way the fabric is super soft but not w,1
10655,I love this top its easily both day and nightworthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peekaboo design lovely embossed design all over,1
10656,This dress is absolutely gorgeous the colors are actually very bright it has a little embroidery and beading in the chest area the fabric is actually very soft and it comes with built in slip i found that it runs true to size i got a medium as i wanted it to be more roomy im planning to wear it with booties long boots or sandals in the spring i think it will make a great teacher dress,1
10657,I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress its very comfortable and stretchy so i got a petite and it fit perfectly where normally i need an or a because clothes are made so tight now it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips and for the bottom of the dress being white it surprisingly wasnt see through i wouldnt go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no,1
10658,Love this only wish it wasnt so seasonal so i could wear it more often this is the softest shirt in my wardrobe cant believe how nice it feels on a little bit slouchy and oversized i usually wear a m and bought a m and it feels perfect like the other reviewer i was a bit worried about shrinkage but washed it in cold and hung it up and and it cam out fine did wash first before i wore because the dye smelled a bit strong,1
10659,This dress is absolutely stunning and well made it can be worn throughout the seasons i love this designer and this dress is a masterpiece,1
10660,I ordered these in a medium and they fit but i wanted more coverage so i sized up i wear a or and i took the large the large isnt tight at all but the medium was i like my bottoms to have a lot of coverage and dont mind them a little big i like how much coverage they provide but still look feminine and cute,1
10661,Got this dress in the mail today and i am blown away the fit is amazing normally i would get an in dresses sometimes a i got a in this one and its perfect hugs in all the right places everyone needs this dress i feel like with the style and fit of this dress it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down cannot wait to wear this one,1
10662,This is a tts cami that should be a staple in everyones closet great for layering,1
10663,Fits perfect im and the size regular fit perfect not too long it too short just perfect,1
10664,This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness i like everything about it,1
10665,I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy unfortunately this dress is huge it is a rectangle with pockets i bought the xxsp my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with methis dress was beyond alterations too bad it was a great idea but no,0
10666,I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect looks great and is very comfy low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages i got it in a small small,1
10667,I just received this dress wadded up in a bag it is nothing like the colors shown on line in the picture it appears blue and white in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldnt try to buy a dress on line,0
10668,I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it until i read dry clean onlyreally retailer i know you can do better than that,0
10669,I ordered this online with a little hesitation due to the negative reviewsit arrived and it is beautifulthe beading and subtle cut outs are gorgeousthe colors of the beadwork in contrast to the nude tone of the fabric is stunning and elegantthe fit is very very flatteringruns very true to size,1
10670,I like the top without the fake fur collar when the collar is removed the necklines shape is really nice the collar seems cheap i thought the sweater ran true to size im lbs a small was a good fit although higher armholes would have made the whole thing fit better through the rib cage it was loose there but necessary looseness for layering anything underneath,1
10671,I love this coat it was a great purchase and i would reccomend it to others it looks great with layers and is comfortable for degree temps definitely size down when buying,1
10672,I love this sweater looks great with leggings or high waisted jeans like most maeve clothing it runs a little large so i would size down i get several compliments every time i wear this one super comfortable too,1
10673,Purchased this sweater in the blue color which is a grayblue it runs large as the xs is still quite roomy on me in the body although the arms are more snug great quality,1
10674,I loke the idea of this jacket but it was executed poorly it makes me look like a football player i am athletic build and i was swimming in the m i tried a small on in store and it still looked like i was wearing shoulder pads it hangs and gaps awkwardly the sleeves are freakishly long and the overall length was too short,0
10675,I seriously love this top and at the sale price its a steal i ordered the ivory color and its just as beautiful in person as in the product photos i thankfully read the reviews and knew that the sleeves would be slit i think the slit sleeves add more interest to an otherwise basic blouse it can be dressed up or down and is great for work at least in my very casual office the fit is perfect i ordered my normal size medium and its definitely truetosize,1
10676,I ordered this dress in the green color the dress did not look like the picture i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance i returned the dress,0
10677,Really like this tunic a lot it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together im always a fan of pockets too i ordered the xs im about it fits loose but not in a bad way the fabric allows it to fall well over the body if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees glad to have snagged this right away more tunics like this please,1
10678,Bought my rd pair of pilcro cords in the dark turquoise the other are from previous seasons love these pants for fall because they are extremely comfortable and stylish the dark turquoise was paired with the poppy tunic in blue at my local store i liked the pairing and ended up buying both i find these to fit true to size vs other items at retailer that fit larger i am a while in most other pants at retailer i am a i am and lbs,1
10679,This tunic could be great but there is some weird construction going on at the armhole first of all the armhole is way too low second there is a totally unnecessary side seam zipper under the arm since this is a tunic it slips over the head no problem no need for the side zipper it adds bulk and distorts the way the fabric should hang at the side,0
10680,The fabric and color are absolutely beautiful the shape of the dress is strange fitted and tight through the waist and enormous everywhere else it was not flattering,0
10681,I would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in they are attached on the inside by a string if the string broke the pockets would dangle for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest too bad,1
10682,Love this top fits true to size not to boxy sleeves are so cute looks very rich a must have in your wardrobe,1
10683,This top is so beautiful looks even better in person i was hesitant because of the price but i am so happy i bit the bullet and ordered i am a c and the bust is slightly snug,1
10684,I picked this dress up in a size fits tts i have a dd chest lbs and ft inches in height i have an hourglass figure and the size was too big and the fit just right the skirt is lined and the upper bodice part is not it says on the tag hand wash which is a plus because dry cleaning is not a plus hits me just about inches above the knee the thick lace detailing is very special and price point with the dress promo made me feel this would be a great dress for the holiday,1
10685,I absolutely love this dress its flattering and feminine you will love it it runs large so size down,1
10686,I love this ponchosweater it feels cozy and looks really cool cant wait til the weather cools down so i can wear it,1
10687,Looking for a stylish rain resistant coat to wear to ireland this fall and looks like this could fit the bill the inch length is perfect the faux fur lined collar and opening edges is a lovely touch fur ends about inches in so not fully lined but great for weather in slow s with a sweater added ample room for that i love the look wish the pockets were just a bit bigger i can barely fit my hand in but overall i think its a keeperi ordered ml and am usually a medium or la,1
10688,Wow i just love this dress it hangs beautifully and is such a great length shoulder straps adjustable simple button closures in back i wore it dressed up a bit with a sweater and then again more causal without i got it on sale so it fit even better,1
10689,The sleeves are small should buy a larger size than usual other than this is perfect,1
10690,Absolutely lovely even better in real life this is not your typical cheap flimsy dress this is quality the fabric is interesting the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering pay attention to the length there are miles of fabric in that fortunyesque skirt and the model is very tall i am and slim and ordered petite small and its a little longer on me than it is on the model i dont mind ive been looking for a specialoccasion dress for a long time and knew this was it,1
10691,I fell in love with this dress immediately gorgeous print and colors light and breezy classic and comfortable the petite length is perfect for my height and hits a few inches above the knee i have a small bust a but a wider rib cage so the petite small was a perfect fit couldnt be more pleased with this purchase,1
10692,This top is crazy in the front and just wayoff when it comes to a crossover drape the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to bloop open constantly the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldnt get to look goodim busty but this isnt the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me the blouse fits tts and everything was covered so its not like it was too small and tugged thats not the case this blouse just didnt,0
10693,I was so pleased to see this in the store and i am glad that i had a chance to feel the knit the combination of wool cotton and nylon creates a really soft luxurious feel to the sweater i was shocked that it didnt have cashmere in the blend it is that soft but it is equally substantial this sweater can surely be worn as a piece of outerwear and it can be used as a layering piece i consider this one tts because i typically wear a m in a knit that isnt fitted i disagree with an earl,1
10694,Ive been looking for a light colored flowy cardigan for awhile and finally found this one is perfect the materials is soft and has just the right about of details for me with the gently ruffled edges tie front an some bunching around the sleeves color is between ivory and tan i am petite height and medium framed with broad shoulders and since they didnt have petite in stock i bought regular s it fits well enough though i probably could have bought an xs my new favorite card,1
10695,This top is too cute and shows just the right amount of skin without being overt it can be worn on or off the shoulder and is just enough to cover a tummy without looking maternity i cant wait for the warmer weather to get here and stay so i can wear this top more often,1
10696,I bought these in vintage sage and i grab for them as often as my favorite skinny jeans if you are just dipping your toe in colored pants i would reccomend the same color it is undertsated and easily paired with so many other colors the legs run a little big but the waist is tru to size so for comfort i went with my usual size,1
10697,Thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece most bulk is in front so it can camouflage areas i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt perfect,1
10698,Love this top tried it on in the store and had to have it did not find it too sheer and could wear my regular bra with it as the shoulders fit where the straps are got tons of compliments on it would have bought in more colors if offered i loved it that much the perfect bohemian hippie chic top if there is such a style,1
10699,Runs extremely large i got an xs and am lbs and this would have fit someone who typically wears a size and is and above very disappointed with the size the quality of the fabric wasnt great either i wanted it to work so bad but just didnt,0
10700,This shirt is just as great in person as it is online its a substantial fabric which is not seethrough which seems hard to find these days with whitish tops the color is more offwhite without looking yellow i ordered a small and medium because i was concerned about the length and tightness in sleeves they fit almost the same with the only difference being that the upper sleeves on the small were just a tad bit more fitted but not in a bad way im and found the length to be jus,1
10701,I love love love these bright red jeans they fit great theyre super soft and comfortable and the bright red is a great punch of color only sad about how expensive they are at that price point i decided to return them but am hoping they get marked down,1
10702,This is my new favorite shirt you can dress it up or down so comfy and totally flattering,1
10703,The photos dont look it but the one i received was a cropped length the bottom of the sweaters longest parts didnt even reach the top of my midrise pants and im so it wasnt that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are tall disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this,0
10704,This is a heavier weight shirt it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so if you dont like loose fitting clothes this is not for you it is well made and looks cute with jeans,1
10705,I am on an retailer diet but i cant stop thinking about this top tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only theyd had my size in stock id have been a goner for sure it is super comfy the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured while im kind of sick of highlow this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face love the sparkle you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long so versat,1
10706,I loved this dress so much i got it in two colors the colors match the picture online its very soft and will work for summer and fall,1
10707,This is my favorite weekend jacket it is so cute soft and comfortable the interior is an extra soft cotton that feels like my most favorite soft teeshirt it is true to size the best features are the versatility of the neck pockets and a little longer in the back great over leggingsyoga pants i ordered sizes just in case the sizing was off an xxs and xxs i am a petite and the xs is roomy enough for a sweater or sweatshirt under it the xxs looked and felt great too and had a m,1
10708,I love this top so much i dare say it is one of my favorite retailer purchases to date i got it in the blue and it is really magical i get compliments every time i wear it i have a pair of dressier black leggings that i never know what to wear with im not really a leggings person but this tunic is exactly the piece plus this tunic comes with pockets whats better than that,1
10709,The online pictures do not do this dress justice the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think oh my gosh thats the one but if you try it on you will have this moment it is comfortable flattering and slimminga prefect everyday dress,1
10710,I love this dress and would have bought it on the spot without hesitation if i just had an event to wear it to i am plus sized pants dress ddd and i never size down but i was able to with this dress because it is so flowy the dress hit just below my knee and the only fit difference i saw when i tried on the petite is that it was slightly shorter still no thigh showing this would be flattering on absolutely anyone if you are worried about bulges this dress will give y,1
10711,I love this top beautiful soft fabric much prettier than picture can be worn on or off shoulders extremely flattering falls to a perfect length great with shorts pants or a long skirt,1
10712,This is a great tshirt i love it it fits great isnt too bulky and has a great length to go with anything i love it,1
10713,These leggings are beautiful and different the material is very stretchy sort of a spandex feel panty lines definitely show in the back i found they run true to size i wear a size medium in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great,1
10714,I ordered this top in the white and cream color combo and love it so much the buttons in the back add a sweet touch easy top for fall spring easy to throw a cardigan over and summer i ordered a medium but probably could have done a small classic retailer,1
10715,I love everything about this dress the sleeve and bodice detail make this dress exceptional the fit is true to size i ordered medium the length is as it appears on the model just below the knee the material is of great quality and the slip lining is made of a nice stretchy knit,1
10716,I bought this tee becasue of the color and brand my favorite tees last summer were by bordeaux and am so pleased the color is great for a fall layering piece and the fabric is so softamazing it may be better for layering the fabric is very thin,1
10717,I purchased this dress for a black tie optional wedding in the mansions of rhode island it was comfortable and appropriate i received so many compliments from strangers wonderfully twirling dress for dancing too,1
10718,This is such a good dress to just throw on and go the inside is lined with fleece so its basically a giant sweatshirt it does run large i normally wear a medium and i bought the small but could have bought the xs if the difference in length between the two hadnt been about a foot i am tall the color is actually a light mint not the grayish blue it appears in the picture overall a great purchase though,1
10719,The color is perfect for fall and into winter only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining the lining was an unexpected bonus and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned upthe fit is true to size and the stressed velvet fabric is current for this seasonim going to enjoy wearing this shirt,1
10720,The dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion i have already worn it several times with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white i took my usual size large and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans dont show thru either this blouse is lightweight and v,1
10721,I hesitated purchasing this because of the high price so kept waiting and then the petite sizes ran out so i figured i missed it then miraculously the petite in the green was available so i went for it this sweater is yummy and cozy drapes beautifully i am short waisted and wear size in most clothes the petite s fits perfectly with a pair of black leggings and high boots this is a winner outfit for fall and winter very comfy the sweater has a bit of an openweave so keep tha,1
10722,This black dress is stunningive already worn it to a fashion show and a wedding and i received so many compliments,1
10723,Poor quality material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured,0
10724,I saw this online and just had to have it it fits and looks exactly as pictured excellent for spring or fall,1
10725,I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail if you have any sort of hips the light pattern in the middle doesnt do you any favors this made my hips look soooo wide and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better with the seam the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips it had to go back,0
10726,These jeans hug in all the right places the high waist accentuates my body and makes my legs look a mile long the jeans will need a trip to the tailor to be hemmed pooling even with my highest heels,1
10727,This is the second tulle skirt by bailey that i have bought the color is a little more grey blue than the picture online but the quality is excellent i am normally a size and i purchased this skirt in medium and fits fine it is a pullon skirt but the waistband doesnt have a lot of stretch to it,1
10728,Just got this top in the mail today and i love it i bought the white in a small and it fits as pictured on the model the fabric says its cotton but its a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk the bodice is lined so no bra lines show through the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or seethrough the arm holes are not too large as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops i think ill be wearing this one a lot this summer and a lot of summers,1
10729,I tried this dress on in store i loved it online but in personnot so much it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume the fabric was bad really bad the mustard color was beautiful boo,0
10730,Love this top you can definitely wear this out with jeans or with dress pants for work it can be dressed up or down so its very versatile the red motif is a gorgeous color for spring and summer received lots of compliments,1
10731,These are very comfy and look great on i would like to get a second pair in the lighter color,1
10732,Cant say enough about the style of this trench the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types the color is great and theres some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coatthe sizing is a little hmmm i ordered a large im usually a on top or a large mostly to accommodate a larger chest ddd i think proportion wise im more a medium through the shoulders and in length so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shapewith,1
10733,I dont know that there needs to be more reviews but here goes the dress is gorgeous i have never received so many compliments on a dress of mine and i have some really lovely ones strangers and friends alike were complimenting me i had been eyeing this online but never pulled the trigger thinking id never need a dress like this anytime soon then i came across this in person at my local store and i instantly fell in love dont hesitate and if youre lucky that retailer is having o,1
10734,This dress is an absolute win i was won over on the hanger by the linen fabrics lightweight nature and then i tried it on such a good fit for my high waist and the tie was super flattering i love this with booties as i was wearing today but think it will be adorable with espadrilles as well for a more summery look its also the rare three season dress with its cut and coloring working most of the year for sizing id say its true to size i got my regular size s with no trouble with,1
10735,I was quite surprised to find the background color of this dress was greynot the stonelinen that i was expecting it still works beautifully against the citrus fits true to size the sleeves are slightly narrow around the forearm but not tight im fairly slim and im in the process of exchanging the petite m for a regular medium as it was just a bit too short for me im very short waistedlong legs so the straight design is perfect for eliminating the issue i also found no p,1
10736,The medium fits perfectly its not too long or too short the feel of the fabric is soft and not heavy at all i love the detail in the bird too it bright and colorful overall a great buy,1
10737,I loved the cut and style of this shirt so was very disappointed when i put it on and it was very tight and slightly seethrough if you do order it get it in a size larger,0
10738,This top is so soft and comfortable i bought it on sale so would i have paid for it not sure fits true to size what can i say its a simple top well made and so soft,1
10739,Love this dress very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it,1
10740,So so cute i am lbs and the fit me perfectly i expected the m or to be too small wore them the first day i received them i have a large waist hips about and the fits great not tight love the material and the workmanship is tops i think they are a great buy especially on sale wore them with a hei hei jacket also on sale cant get much better,1
10741,I bought this tshirt in three colors and im keeping them because they work for what i want travel clothes but the tshirts run big and are too boxy i think they look nice if you tuck them in,1
10742,The title says it all while the quality was good when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper the length was longer than on the model makes sense since i am only which was ok but the overall fit was just too big i am a size and tried the xs which was huge just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way going back,0
10743,I love this dress the colors are so pretty and the fit is very flattering,1
10744,I bought this yesterday and love it it drapes beautifully its a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semicasual occasions the first tier hits at the natural waist while the second tier hits at about hip height this is very flattering for the waist while still being drapey and a bit loose i thought this fit a little bigger than to size i am currently postpartum boobed so i am lbs and dd and the s fit great i am currently a s in other retailer tops,1
10745,Im happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me im and lbs and it made me look like i had gained lbs as others have said the pockets make the dress even worseits very hard to get them to lay flat the material is lovely soft and i liked the gray color but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum,0
10746,I have been wearing tankinis for a long time and havent worn a one piece in years im and lets be honest things dont look the same in a bathing suit as they did years ago this suit is very flattering im not obese but i do have a bit of a jelly roll in the stomach area and the combination of the polka dots and the ruching as well as the construction of the suit itself with the side panels really camouflages my stomach area although there isnt underwire which i prefer i do f,1
10747,A perfect summer dress beautiful print and is extremely flattering for a curvy frame i have worn this dress twice and have received at least compliments each time only note wearing a bra with this dress isnt really a possibility due to the back detail its pasties or if youre okay being free flowing your chest isnt too large you can get away with it,1
10748,This dress is adorable in the photo however in reality it fits like a tent the top would be okay although i would need a smaller size if i were to keep it it flares out in the skirt to become an aline and its just not very flattering if i had read the reviews before ordering i would have sized down but i ordered before any reviews had been posted sadly i must return,0
10749,Exactly as pictured great and lightweight for summer but long enough with the cowl neck to layer for colder seasons so comfy and easy,1
10750,Love these pants the are super comfy and very flattering but they are very long i did manage to have them alteredbut you may risk losing the flare which is unfortunate considering the price,1
10751,This dress did not impress me when i was browsing the website online when i went to a store though the colors struck me as really vibrant and earthy and i wanted to give it a chance i tried it on and it fit like a glow i am a pounds and got an xxs p which was a perfect fit the length was great for me petite size and did not need altering the online photo may not do justice to the little details on this dress definitely a very high quality dress that i would categorize as a,1
10752,I am in love with this tunic i wear it with everything jeans leggings and just tights super comfy quality design runs a bit large but i like that,1
10753,This is a super comfy and adorable shirt got the black motif it could def be passed off as a darkinkish navy color too so its very versatile it runs typicaltts for maeve if youre unfamiliar with the brand order up one or two sizes if you have broad shoulders andor large arms this is super lightweight feels slinky for lack of a better word essentially its rayongauze but it is doublelayered so it is not sheer at all no need for a cami although in the lighter version i c,1
10754,Love this dress its comfortableand it can be worn casualties or formally,1
10755,Maternity like and although the back is really cool there is too much material in the front and it is almost like thin ribbed long underwearpajama returned,0
10756,Love this sweater jacket super comfortable and warm i am and i got a xs petite it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season its easy to wear it up and wear it down i appreciate that its not super bulky which was what i was afraid of my favorite jacket of the season so far,1
10757,This dress is sure to become one of my favorites i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person very vivid it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but im sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often i cant wait,1
10758,Too tight in strange ways beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it however it just did not fit,0
10759,Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top as soon as i put it on i was amazed at how pretty it is im and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size i would say if you are between sizes you may want to size down i didnt have any issues with the lace and the slight vneck falls perfectly on me no need to wear any cami my only concern was how wrinkled the top was i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin,1
10760,I agree with all the positive reviews about the look fit and comfort of this dress definitely a four season dress for winter i plan on wearing wool tights wool coat and boots and keeping the waist untied for me both the medium petite regular looked good just a bit tight in the shoulders since thats how my body is built im keeping the regular hem version my stats for fit reference dd meaty armsshouldersback small hips no waistbum,1
10761,I love pilcro and this pair is another proof why i love it i bought a pair in light red the color is so pretty the fit is perfect i normally wear petites but this time bought a regular length and i love it it is not too long as the pants are cropped and not too short as the petite cut might have beenpilcro never disappoints me as i have many different pairs and love each one of them may go for another color in this same style they are awesome,1
10762,Very cute top just as pictured nice soft material color is bright and true to size wore it to work today on casual friday and received many compliments highly recommend,1
10763,This is a great white dress for summeri tried on a in store and it was too big for me especially in the underarm area when i tried on the it fit perfectly i almost felt like there should be a ha ha because it felt like it made more of a difference to downsize than i expected that being said i took the home since it looked like it was tailored to fit my body but not in a super tight wayfyi im not super curvy if you have a larger chest you may need your regular size,1
10764,First its huge im not big busted but its so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant not exactly what i was going for nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it inand im short waisted so no tucking for me back it went,0
10765,Love everything about this dress its true to size flows nicely great quality its just amazing,1
10766,Great fabric and color but fits like a potato sack so sad bc i would have loved it,0

10768,Love the shape and flow of this dress but i was sent a dirty stained dress so this is going backwould not recommend,0
10769,This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offeringso i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well i ordered in the p i am about it fits beautifullyeven though its a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the p it is no longer available though but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is,1
10770,I wore out a pair of level shorts a couple of years ago ordered these in the same size and they are huge so i am sending them in for exchange and hope im guessing right linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics love the length which can be adjusted by rolling good pockets gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color belt loops if needed though i rather hope theyre not,1
10771,I got this dress in the mail today and its one of the best dresses ive ever gotten at retailer the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin the fit is true to size for maeve and is so flattering for reference im thin lbs but curvy and usually order a regular xs in maeve im usually an xsp and the xsp fit perfectly it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt also from retailer or on its own,1
10772,Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender petite builds may want to size down for reference i am dd,1
10773,Grabbed this top because i loved the color and to my surprise i loved the style too it is longer on me than the model and im and it looks great with a long pendant necklace and white skinny jeans i also wear a white tank underneath just in case otherwise i think id be showing some skin i like that the front and back are two different materials,1
10774,Perfect jean these jeans are comfortable the length is great and the rise at least for me is spot on my torso is fairly straight not a lot of the hourglass thing going on and somehow these jeans feel like they were made for me thank you pilcro,1
10775,This anorak is perfection perfect weight color and the style is super easy to wear i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all im lbs d with an average buildframe and i took a size small i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater i think xs would have been too tight in the shouldersbust it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape i got this during the off promo,1
10776,Its hard to tell how you will like this top unless you try it on first yes it runs big and wide but not long which i like yes it it is fairly sheer but the design allows for a fitted tank i found it adorable once those first two issues were corrected its a cute late summer top easy breathing for humidity i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh,1
10777,Delayed for a month on back order this dress was worth the wait the beautiful design and colors are just as shown in the pictures the length and cut is slimming more fitted at the bodice with a subtle flare after the waist detachable liner dress is a stetchy tank top that goes to the knees pullover style with a closedend side zip thats needed because the knit band design under the bust does not stretch at all if your skin is sensitivethis dress isnt for you both the line,1
10778,Gorgeous and soft luxurious feeling sweater i purchased this in the pinkpurple color that is no longer showing as available and just love it its unbelievably soft feels like a blanket i found that if you sort of fold the neck line under a little it drapes like a cowl neck a little and not quite as off the shoulderas its very cold where i amcant see wearing it that far off during the winter that was my solution and i love it im typically and xs bought the xxs bc it appeared,1
10779,I bought this at the store today and its the perfect summer top im not going to pull it off my shoulders so its a little shorter than shown here but it goes great with capris and skinny jeans and i plan to take it with me to italy it will go with so many things very well made thickish material,1
10780,I love this tunic im and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings it is so soft and comfortable and i love the pink colorvery versatile my favorite thing about this piecei am a dd and havent bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic which fits over my chest and is so flattering many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs largei agree but for those of us who are busty its an opportunity to wear a cute breezy style with buttons and a collar,1
10781,Make sure to get the whole outfit the skirt sits high enough so that it avoids the muffin look,1
10782,This cute top fits great its got a nice fit on arms shoulders and bust then flares out a bit to give ease to the tummy area the back has a cute button trim and solid blue inset cute top,1
10783,This sweater is lovely i have worn it every other day since i got it it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with i have gotten compliments every time ive worn it my daughter who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear said i looked like a winter princess in this it is so flattering and comfortablea winning combination,1
10784,Very comfortable sweater the material is very soft and not itchy at all i had the hardest time deciding between sizes the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms a bit of a boxy shape the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose ended up going with a small since it was less boxy its a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love,1
10785,These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short the embroidery gives them a nice touch i am ordering another pair,1
10786,Absolutely beautiful and well made this pair of jeans is perfect no flaws whatsoever i usually wear size but bought the as it fits better is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans i prefer it nice and fitted so works better im lucky to find them still available in the store while its not online i didnt hesitate to buy at full price which i rarely did im so in love with my new purchase very happy,1
10787,This dress is very flattering i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing i am and wear a i tried on a size that was at the store as a return and there was about a inch gap to get the side zip closed although i normally wear a size i ordered size because of my experience with the dress at the store the size is slightly big across the bust but looks ok i think the size wouldve been too tight,1
10788,This dress was so pretty on the hanger but a saggy sack on even the sz was too loose and shapeless there is no waist as pictured the hilow hem loose fit and wavy waist seam see in the third closeup picture make it look like the dress shrunk oddly in the wash its really too bad its such a pretty combination of patterns,0
10789,I love this top which gives you the look of a blouse but the ease of a tshirt the sky blue color is spectacular the details of this top are beautiful and very flattering i am tall at and it was plenty long enough i ordered my typical size s and it was perfect it is cut to follow the lines of the body i cant wait until the spring so i can wear it it would be great if it was available in more colors,1
10790,Really cute and comfy and casual skirt i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer i did size down one size highly recommend will get lots of wear,1
10791,Love this dress i bought is for a tropic vacation my husband and i went on and it was great i got so many compliments while wearing it and it was comfortable dress is a little roomy in the top but not enough to prevent me from wearing it i ordered a medium,1
10792,I so wanted to love this tank and was so excited to get it in the mail i got a size small my usual and it ran so large i wasnt even sure an xs wouldve fit properly the material looked lighter and blousey on the model but in person is much thicker and sort of hangs underarms run large and are gaping from the body i am sad to return this top because i love the color and idea of it but it just cant work on me,0
10793,I loved this dress it fit perfectly everywhere except for the sleeves the dress has an overall relaxed fit but the sleeves were way too tight i had to send back because of sleeves,0
10794,First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular the length hits right below my bum so its perfectly structured to wear with leggings the cable knit is super soft and very warm wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price,1
10795,Love this sweater the hilow length is fun the elbow length sleeves are great wish retailer offered more colors low part of the sweater is a touch clingy at first but stretches well works well with jeans or leggings overall perfect layering piece for all seasons,1
10796,I love this top i was thinking that i was going to need a xlarge because im very busty i tried it on at the store and the large was perfect its comfortable and flattering not boxy at all i bought it in plum and white the plum is more a wine color than a purple which i prefer the buttons are beautiful but i couldnt see myself buttoning and unbuttoning all of them since they dont slide out of the buttonholes easily but i had no trouble slipping it over my head with just a fe,1
10797,I tried this blouse on in the store im generally an or in this brand i got down to a size and gave up this blouse is huge all the way around the detail on the blouse is pretty but the tent like cut made it impossible for me to buy it i know retailers blouses can be swingy and flows but this went way beyond perhaps on a tall person the swing would work but on a short person like myselfi looked ridiculous,0
10798,I tried this dress on and thought it was stunning the cut was just right it fit all my slight curves im and lbs a slender build and bought the size it is lined and the material is high quality with an illusion of sheer the length hits me just on my knees and the look is so audrey hepburn the belt is made of a grosgrain black material and adds another elegant touch if used it looks great without it too of course this dress comes at a high price point but with the of full p,1
10799,This dress is perfect length right below the knee white slip lining adds to quality smocking fits upper body perfectly,1
10800,Totally bummed the pretty print doesnt outweigh the very odd fit of this dress makes you look really top heavy and even the print which looks so cute online looks muddled in person sadly went right back,0
10801,I really love these jeans this is my second pair of ags and theyre so comfortable i will say that these jeans are super long i have long legs and it takes a inch lift from my shoes to get them to hit correctly if youre short you can expect to get them hemmed the high waist is great size down in ag because they tend to stretch and being high waisted they for differently,1
10802,I was looking for something to wear for an event at an art gallery i actually really loved this dress i think it hides body flaws i tired on the xs but the small was a little more flowing it was comfortable and very fun to wear i am short so the length was great for me i wore a different full length black slip under it which was more comfortable for me go try it on too see if it fits for your body style it was great for me,1
10803,I wore this dress for this first time today and it is a headturner sure to be a new favorite i received several compliments while out running errands the dress is flattering to my hourglass shape i tied it in the back it is not at all clingy it flows nicely the top of the dress is brafriendly and not too low cut i am and found the length to be just right for me the medium skims the tops of my feet and i wore the dress with flat sandals unlike another reviewer the dress i rec,1
10804,I usually do not like three quarter sleeve shirts and i do not like tie necks of any sorts this blouse has both and i love it i loved it in pictures and against my two dislikes listed above i gave it a chance i am glad i did the shirt is lined in the body which means the white one is not see throughyey no need for cami underneath the lining also adds extra warmth as this is a very thin fabric shirt the sleeves are loose enough so that the length does not restrict me the tie some,1
10805,Material is too thin and quality is poor,0
10806,Had to return ordered an xs which usually fits perfect b chest and it was falling off shoulders and chest it was like a sleeping bag huge fan of retailer but there is a design flaw in this sweater,0
10807,I have never been able to find a maxi dress that just fits me im pretty short and the xs petite comes exactly to my ankles no hemming necessary the neckline is very flattering and the waist is a semiempire elastic waistline that makes this dress both elegant and comfortable the dress is very stretchy but doesnt look like it it is absolutely one of my summer staples now especially for traveling if i could have this dress in fifty different patterns i would,1
10808,Id describe these as a hybrid pantlegging they are very comfortable flattering and versatile i got the large because medium was sold out but they fit nice not super tight,1
10809,I first saw these in store but decided to risk waiting for them to go on sale and no regrets they are a great high quality and the print is exactly what i hoped it to be,1
10810,This top is comfortable and flattering i really like the simplicity a wearable basic summer top with a cute twist just enough to make it contemporary but not overstated,1
10811,I got the xs and it fits perfectly almost an a line cute slightly fuller on the bottom not too form fitting and not too loose i am and the length is not short as it appears in the photo on the model the yellow flower pattern is super cute material is soft and comfy,1
10812,These jeans are so comfortable and do not stretch out enough to size down in my opinion right when i put them on i could tell they fit perfectly i have been buying pilcros for several years and have not been happy with the stet ankle jeans from the last yrs because although they were very flattering when you first put them on they stretched out so much it was annoying these script jeans are amazing flattering and are a nice lightweight denim i wore them a few times before washing and,1
10813,Joggers are my new style this springsummer i think i love the simplicity of this style the cut is perfect very true to size i like the longer length perfect to wear with kitten heels flats or slip on canvas this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit,1
10814,Just as beautiful as in the picture it is warm and the best part is that it is not itchy love it and cannot wait to wear it as the weather changes,1
10815,This is a unique beautiful dress and it fits like a glove,1
10816,Love this dress it can be dressed up or down and its very comfortable i got the ps but could have probably fit into a pxs since the style is rather loose,1
10817,Darling jacketcoat similar styling as the beige with big flowers and laceup back that i bought a few years ago and still love i was considering this one but the description says to hand wash seriously a coat thats simply not practical not sure if i will buy this one,0
10818,What a great purchase love this vest i live in pa and i see myself wearing this sweater for seasons which i love great details length and knit true to size,1
10819,I absolutely love this sweater and the color is beautiful i read through the reviews and purchased a medium as i read that this sweater ran large im very happy i sized downi havent yet worn it and hope that it does stay off the shoulder as pictured without having to constantly rearrangegreat sale price,1
10820,This dress is a lovely creation however i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit it runs extremely large i am weighing around i ordered a petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small ha it was a sack the petite was little better the petite was perfect but i have never worn a petite in my entire lifeotherwise this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come if only it had been made of silk it would be un,1
10821,Loved this top when i first saw it online and when it arrived it didnt disappoint at all dress it up or down,1
10822,Most casual tops are so sloppy now not this one great cut wish there were more color options,1
10823,The blue dress is lovely fit true to size and a good all around comfy dress,1
10824,This dress is amazing and spans multiple uses i brought it to st john with me and used it as an after swim dress as well as a going out on the town dress it is flattering and a light but durable material the only thing that was even remotely challenging was that i needed to adjust my bra straps to be hidden overall i loved the dress and totally recommend it,1
10825,Very cute top even prettier in person i ordered it by mistake but i am definitely keeping it the regular xs size fits perfectly i was concerned about my twin sisters,1
10826,I ordered the navy in size xl and it fits me just as it does the model this top is definitely one of my favorite retailer purchases the cut is very flattering i love how they designed the tunic to have a closer fit on top the arms and through the top of the waist and then flow out im a pearshape and worried the bottom layer might accent my hips but it all flows really nicely the arms arent tight theyre not loose but arent too poofythe material washed well too without static a pro,1
10827,Dress it up or go casual this dress has it all well made and comfortable where other lace rubs the wrong way under arms this is super soft cant wait to pair different shoe colors and jewelry,1
10828,Bought the greenblue colors are bright fabric is so soft the neckline is just right for a small chest the top is structured nicely giving you a figure flattering fit,1
10829,Bummed out this is super cheaply made and very expensive the design is different the color is beautiful but the material is a different story it should be priced at the most bucks not im returning them also they run very big,0
10830,I saw the skirt on a display today at my local store i was attracted by the colors and the display itself my thoughts give it a chance i bought the size without even trying it on with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential i am so pleased with this skirt the fit is true although if you like a higher ride on the waist i would size down the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi,1
10831,This dress is so pretty and the neckline is darling,1
10832,Love this top a new take on traditional flannel yes it is pricey for flannel yes it is not thick like a traditional flannel shirt but it is feminine sexy comfortableeven my husband liked it on me i ordered a regular small wish i wouldve went for a petite xsmall however they are sold out regardless i am keeping for reference i am and the small is definitely roomy,1
10833,I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent soft fabric and for a whitelightly striped dress not sheer im bummed because after washing only twice followed the instructions to wash on gentle cycle and low tumble dry holes started appearing everywhere both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest in the white part of the fabric only it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget,0
10834,These are adorable pants i ordered them in both colors because i couldnt decide which was cuter they are light and airy but not see through they will be perfect to use as a swim coverup pajamas dress them up anything very comfortable and versatile i am a size and ordered a medium and they fit perfect the elastic doesnt pinch but probably would have if i would have went with a small,1

10889,Cure pants just bought them they look black but the description says blue motif does anyone else have them and knowif they are black or blue,1
10890,This piece didnt make sense to me maybe its bc im a yankee fan but it reminded me of a high end baseball jersey that was sheer i didnt think it was office appropriate but too dressy for casual wear it went back,0
10891,This is a perfect casual too to pair with jns and shorts for spring,1
10892,Oh i wanted this dress to work i bought it in green red and the solid blue all ran really small i just fit in a when i would normally take a in retailer sizes and lbs as with many other reviewers i also noticed that the zipper was a huge flaw it took a long slow motion to get it zipped because it would get stuck on the fabric variations such a cute style was really bummed it didnt work i kept ordering it in other colors thinking i would hit the jackpot but they wer,0

10894,I love retailer and fell in love as soon as i saw this dress online being i love a quality maxi dress and this one did not disappoint however being also means the top sweater overlay hits me way short it looks ridiculous i also thought that this was very heavy for a maxi dress and could not imagine wearing it in degree weather unfortunately after waiting so long for its arrival this is going back,0
10895,I bought both colors thinking i might like one since i wasnt totally sold on colors looking online well the cut is sooo flattering that i was sold and had to keep both this shirts are great,1
10896,I really loved this in the catalog the fabric and details are very pretty however its a lot of fabric without much form my husband suggested it for maternity not realizing it has fitted slip not for curvy hourglass had to send it back,0
10897,I love this top its long enough to to wear with leggings and the ribbon in the back really dresses it up the only negative is that the material pulls easy and only on the space dye color not the solids but i still love it for reference i ordered xs and it fits perfectly i am lbs,1
10898,This is a great top and worth the money nice flow to it soft material and light weight for hot summer days many light weight tops are sheer and require a cami this one does not which is key for those of us that live in hot climates dont miss out,1
10899,There isnt a whole lot that i did like about this dress the shoulders have large poufs the fabric isnt very soft and its not flattering maybe with a belt i could be tempted but i wasnt too fond of the dress,0

10901,Received this top as a gift from a friend with great taste found fabric to have high quality feel and texture and it fit quite well love how the flutter layer creates a different look,1
10902,However i unfortunately followed others advice saying these run small i had to return exchange to a p in turn had to give up the sassy red and settle for black although they are beautiful trousers in black as well,1
10903,I did not like this cashmere sweater at all i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking it was also very short not worth the money even at off,0
10904,This skirt has a unique fun pattern and a fit that is absolutely perfect just figure flattering without being too tight or revealing cant wait to wear it for a holiday dinner,1
10905,These are very cool leggings the cut out design really puts them several classes above a simple black legging they can be worn with dressier tops and could be a sophisticated looking outfit i wore them for the first time today and really loved them i didnt feel like i was out in leggings but more like i was wearing a nice pair of pants the fabric is soft and the cut is very flattering all over including the rear they are definitely sculpting and firming they fit the same sizewise as,1
10906,Perfect top the color is absolutely beautiful and the fit is better than i imagined it would be love,1
10907,These are some of the softest most comfortable shorts i own and wish i had them in more colors i like that i an adjust the length of the cuff since its not hemmed to a certain length i ordered the pinksalmon color and they go with so much,1
10908,This is a true retailer dress cute and quirky kudos for the builtin liner with scalloped hem very pretty and pockets i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress and the white background makes the colors and details really pop pun intended i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small i usually wear size regular in this brand im b waist hips im and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees but when i tried on size,1
10909,This jacket doesnt look all that special in the photos provided i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with s power suits i call this look full sigourney weaver and it is marvelous perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa so happy with this purchase highly recommend,1
10910,I was really disappointed when i tried this top on the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off the cut of the top overall was just off,0
10911,This top is very pretty and figureflattering because of the way it nips in under the bust the neckline and color are also flattering however it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off i wound up not buying it due to the price but id probably snap it on sale,1
10912,Purchased in the blue the color is a little darker than it shows more of a slate blue loved the fit i am tall so it covered perfectly,1
10913,The length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting,0
10914,My friend and i both bought this in the white color in our usual sizes the fabric is soft the neckline is flattering and the drawstring is cute hides a tummy beautifully the store had the white and the green the green color looks very different in person than it does online in person it is darker and more of a soft emerald greennot the pale greengray pictured online,1
10915,Wish they had more colors in these pants the dark grey is very nice but id definitely take another color if offered very cute pants a fantastic deal at the sale price but size down they run a full size too big,1
10916,I cannot say enough excellent things about these jeansthey fit beautifully have just enough stretch and sit high enough on my waist to cover any unsightly rolls this was my first pilcro purchase and i will definitely be adding other styles to my closet in the near future typically im a size or in denim but i sized down to a in these after the sales associate made that suggestion im so glad i didthey are a perfect fit,1

10919,I first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail i thought it was beautiful so ethereal i never thought that i would own it though because of the initial price i never thought it would make it to clearance to my surprise it did and then went the extra off i took the plunge i followed the advice of the other reviewers and ordered a size down a small i am glad that i did i still feel like i get the oversized wrapped in warmth feel it is not a figure fl,1
10920,This is a closet staple loose fitting but lovely well made,1
10921,Cute and different dress cute with bootsvery comfortable runs large could size down,1
10922,This color rich pattern will transition nicely into the fall season it wears well with a bare leg and will look great with opaque tights later in the season the higher waist and gathering work well on my figure,1
10923,Hei hei is my favorite line i am a medium in all of the pants i have ever purchased from this brandi ordered these in the green and they arrived today they fit me as if they were an xxl i have a similar pair in rust from last summer so i assumed that they would be the same obviously they are going back tomorrow im very disappointed they are a nice looking jogger and the color is pretty,0
10924,This shirt feels amazing it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering great versatile piece,1
10925,Im so glad i trusted my instincts and decided not to size down on this luxurious dress since my body type is so different from the previous reviewers size small would have surely cut off my circulation around my shoulders i bought mp since i have thick armsshouldersback and im short my only gripe is how skinny and insubstantial the straps are so maybe ill get those changed im tempted to buy the other color since this dress is so beautiful but i really dont nred it,1
10926,Very comfortable but ran small great quality and great look,1
10927,I love the style and quality of this skirt the material is a bit heavier than anticipated so it works well in cooler months and the thickness makes it easy to wear a shirt underneath it fits true to size my usual is formfitting without being overly snug or pulledi am on the taller side and the skirt is fairly long it comes to the bottom of my knee,1
10928,I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer i was given this in a s but it wasnt even close to meeting in the front so i returned it for a m it doesnt button anyway but i didnt want it to look like it wouldnt meet at all i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store and it fit perfectly so this one is just running small overall i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater,1
10929,I bought this blouse in a size my normal size to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps it was a hit i felt beautiful and professional and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work the collar and cuffs really set the design off this top is much more impressive in person,1
10930,This dress might be the most comfortable article of clothing i own especially for the hot summers it is attractively loose and so light that you barely feel like you are wearing it love it,1
10931,I love this peasant dress i have worn it twice already with black lizard cowboy bootsfrye jane boots black tights and silver sparkly earrings no need for a necklace because of the beautiful beading at the yokethe fabric is rayon and has a beautiful drape so it doesnt poof out like a maternity dress it is lined has sleeves with an elasticized cuff and hits around my knee this dress could have definitely supported pockets in the side seams or patch pockets on the front i have,1
10932,The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is it is very delicate even says so on the tag and lightweight so that you wont dread wearing it in the heat of the day by what doesnt show up is that this caftan shimmersthere is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen it adds significantly to the impact of the garment and i love this detail i love the way this caftan drapes and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan the,1
10933,If youre looking for a sweater thats super soft and comfortable youve found it you could wear this almost anywhere except for a dressy occasion but then of course you wouldnt wear it with a dress anyway i wish it came in other colors because id buy several its on the thin side but not too thin the only thing that i should mention is that its not a black black but more of a faded or brownish black which is really obvious with black leggings or jeans,1
10934,This is ruching done right i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as wellit is fitted but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything so unless this particular color is your nemesis this dress is a winner,1
10935,I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it i felt it ran a little big im a dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the girls but a small fit me and fit well i didnt find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders i paid full price but i loved it so much i didnt mind the sale price is amazing,1
10936,Great pair of pants to wear to work and interview or out to lunch i got so many compliments the first time i wore these im i ordered the burgundy color in a size regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that theyre a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed,1
10937,I love this dress it is so flattering and comfortable i am petite with curves and feel so good when wearing this i ordered a petite small i will have to stop myself from wearing it every day this summer,1
10938,Really beautiful skirt unique print red and stylish keep in mind this is knit stretchy form fitting as mentioned the skirt is very comfortable and a heavier texture fabric i purchased a large i am and lbs and dont like skirts too tight so i sized up the large is fine however i noticed at the bottom of the skirt it doesnt quite fit as slim as i would like i suspect the m would be better if you have a stomach it will show i also noticed that the skirt seemed much longer on,1
10939,I ordered these in m lbs and they are tts they fit well and are neither tight nor loose the issue that i have with them and the reason that i sent them back is that the material although comfortable is completely transparent if i were to try to run out to get the mail in these the whole neighborhood would essentially see me bottomless furthermore these are not white but offwhite and quite a yellowy offwhite at that so these loungers dont look as cute with the feature,0
10940,Love this top looks much better on than the hanger the color and fabric are very nice,1
10941,Top opens in the middle right in front should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return,0
10942,Im in love im in love and i dont care who knows it i bought this vest on a whim and im so glad i did its so soft and cozy the medium brown color makes it highly versatile as well ive tried the faux fur vests and they are too bulky for my taste but this was not bulky at all warm and hangs well i am lbs curvyathletic frame and the small was just right try this vest oni promise you will be in love,1
10943,I just purchased this adorable drop waist dress online and personally found it to fit tts in my regular size small d the length in the front hits right to the top of my knees perhaps a tad longer so its not too short for me im only and the back is longer in length there is also a detachable matching cotton slip that snaps on or off the dress that has adjustable straps that hit just above my knees i love that this dress was made from cotton and the color is just as picture,1
10944,I love this shirt i had my eye on it for awhile but wasnt sure what size id be so i went to the store to try they only had a small which i figured i would be but it was a little large and not as fitted as i would like it across the chest i got an xs and it was perfect i am about lbs and a small c cup and it fits great i love it,1
10945,I am lb generally size medium shirt size or pants and bought a size i have had two csections so my stomach has some problem areas which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit not this one i felt good it hid my problem spots showed off curves and stays in place i cant speak to the durability of it yet however it makes me feel great and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit that in itself makes it worth the price try it,1
10946,I got this at the sale price and it fits great the bottom was wrinkled so it was not as open at the end like the picture but i am sure an iron will help,1
10947,This vest is much silkier than the pictures online show which was a great surprise the cut of this vest is beautiful and it can be worn so many ways,1
10948,Very cute i received many compliments when i wore it fits true to size petite with some good stretch in it i am and it was slightly longer than that on the model it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like,1
10949,I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like im so i appreciate the length and fit will get a lot of use out of this good w skinny jeans and i cant seem to have enough black tops,1
10950,I get the great reviews these do for me what no jogger could i have hips i never thought these would work they do and they look just as cool on me as the model i am a i could only find a but i think a would be perfect they are effortlessly cool and casualfor all body types im so excited i tried these on,1
10951,This top is so cute and of spectacular quality but you have to size up im a mc all the time i almost never have to size up or down but this top was so tight around the bust that i couldnt possibly have closed the zipper in the back im sending it back for a l in the hopes of a better fit the coloring of the owls is outofthisworld cute so im keeping my fingers crossed that a larger size will be just right,1
10952,Looks exactly as it does in the pictures very comfortable loose flowing and has a slip underneath it im personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because its always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size with that i have wide hipsbig thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large but thankfully the medium fits like a glove,1
10953,I wish i had purchased these earlier in the winter season because i could wear them every single day they are phenomenal plus i got them during a great sale the reviews i read said they run small so i went a full size up and they fit perfectly i usually wear a bought a one of the best winter wardrobe purchases ive ever made totally versatile and because theyre black they can be dressed up or down,1
10954,Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it its totally different than your typical tee the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings my favorite part is the t strap in the back such a beautiful detail and so much fun my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust im a little more full figured so the top looks better on me when the silk part isnt under my boobs kinda have,1
10955,As a mom items in my wardrobe that are easy to throw on in a flash comfortable to run around in with my kids and still look like i took some time putting together my outfit are priceless these fit the bill on all counts they look fantastic with a pair of booties and a light flowing topthese have to be the most comfortable joggers ever made,1
10956,This is a pretty dress but the cut is quite boxy i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then flare out more around the waist down to the hem however the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down which lends to a rather unflattering look,0
10957,At first i was taken by the beautiful lacework and the pictures online showing what appeared to be a loose but shaped silhouette the pictures must have been staged with pins in the back because in person the shirt fits like a circus tent without exaggeration there is a surplus of about inchesthe material is still beautiful and because of that i havent decided whether ill return this shirt or try cutting out some excess fabric to create a cleaner more fitted shape,0
10958,This sweater is much more brilliant in person the photo online doesnt do it justice a couple of things the faux fur collar is removable and it is attached with buttons of the same color as the sweater the color is also more buttery than it appears it hits right at the hip which is so nice for wearing with dresses or skinny jeans and boots for a night out i am pounds and the xs hit me at hipline and was roomy without being oversized its really fun and festive with the collar,1
10959,Great weekend toss around piece or with gym clothes the cut is flattering yet not tight i purchased in colos bc i liked it so much and was looking for a piece like this for a very long time cute with yoga legging jeans sweats etc,1
10960,I am one month post partum and have had so much trouble finding jeans that fit my old jeans fit in the legs and thighs but not my new tummyi love my old pilcro jeans but didnt want to spend the money on jeans in a size so much larger than my normwell after ordering other brands much cheaper i broke downspent the money and sized up i am normally a and ordered a due to waist size they came today and fit like a glovei am so happy its worth every penny to wear jeans that fi,1
10961,I love this i will sport it in the spring with white capris leggings and awesome for a beach coverup the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch i purchased the large but couldve gotten away with a slender fit in medium i am lbs,1
10962,Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite im and typically wear a size in retailer sizes i went with a medium regular based on other reviews thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy,1
10963,I like the weight of this sweater it breathes a little but the knit isnt too thin it is a little seethrough so i like to stick to solids underneath it its just a cleaner look than seeing pattern peeking through great rose color,1
10964,Love this jacketgot my usual size medium and is perfect beautiful quality,1
10965,I love everything about this dress the coloring fabric and flow of it its so much better in person than online its true to size and very comfortable a great price as well,1
10966,The perfect pair i am lb and ordered size and it fits just right it is a little stretchy so molds to your shape the legs are slender but not too fitted no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt,1
10967,Buy these they are a keeper sturdy fabric not too thin and they do not sag or stretch after wearing i tested them before taking the tag off by sitting in them on my couch for several hours comfy soft fabric i will be ordering other colors hoping that black will be available,1
10968,I also found this blouse fits well and runs true to size a size was perfect not too tight and not too full the umbrellas and raindrops are so cute and bright i will wear with jeans or dressier slim pants what fun,1
10969,In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better im short but this regular fit well looks super cute ive gotten so many compliments on it comfortable and the pockets are always nice,1
10970,This shirt is more stunning in person the color is a brighter turquoise than shown the details are beautiful fits true to size is very flatteringslimming love it,1
10971,I purchased this jumpsuit for christmas parties this year and have received so many compliments its a great fit and very comfortable i especially love the pockets very flattering,1
10972,Perfect summer dress feminine cool with just the right flow hides the bad and has a nice shape,1
10973,This top is just lovely the bow on the back is so unusual i am so glad i bought it i washed it on gentle and it turned out great,1
10974,I am a true size in virtually everything pants or dress i was swimming in these i am reordering a size they were so big,1
10975,Fits great structured but still comfy figure flattering,1
10976,This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliqus and embroidery make this very slimming as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high i wont be raising my arms much wearing this the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until im sure im not tangl,1
10977,These embroidered jeans are very nice they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery these jeans are loose and expand with wear it is perfectly ok to size down,1
10978,I love everything about this sweater it is very well made beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one but none are left i am ft tall and weigh about pounds i can wear a but not in this sweater it runs very well and i highly recommend it hope they make more in this style it is so fresh looking and so comfortable,1
10979,Lots of embellishment striking magenta color feels great on with a flattering neckline that isnt too low i recommend it,1
10980,This dress looks way better on you than sitting on the hanger the design really flatters your body and the waist area makes you look very skinny highly recommend the length is also perfect just the right length for a maxi dress long enough but short enough to show off your shoes as well,1
10981,Besides being my favorite color to wear this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles the fit is not what im used to because it fits in a s type of way and when i took it to my tailor she ensured me that it is the perfect fit the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces but is perfect for a night out,1
10982,This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion totally worth the price its very very well made and fits perfectly i usually wear a size but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist i size down to so they fit properly i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove im and the skirt comes to midcalf on me which is exactly what i was looking for love love love this skirt i totally recommend it,1
10983,I wanted to like this dress but it just did not work for a bustier frame the fabric is quite loose does not nip in at the waist and is not particularly clingy so if you are wellendowed your assets create a bit of a shelf from which the rest of the dress just hangs as a result the swing comes from the apex of your chest as opposed to from your hips as on the model and the asymmetrical hemline makes the look even more awkward on smaller curves this would likely be very flattering but,0
10984,A really beautiful well made dress runs extremely big though im not petite by any means and ordered a large but im positively swimming in it an oversized look works for this particular dress but i think its supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style,1
10985,Love the wash and fit of this jean the perfect summer go to for me,1
10986,Im a big fan of maeve products still even when i like something i always prefer to try on in the store just to be certain i decided to risk it this time and was so happy when this top came and it fit perfectly im lbs but carry more weight on bottom so i ordered the its just rightcute and flowy ill probably get another one in a different color,1
10987,Color style adjustability easy fit flattering yes on so many levels oh wait its on sale fantastic magnificent and pretty i bought medium and in,1
10988,From the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful it is even prettier in person than it is online,1
10989,Oh how i love this dress i was worried because i am very busty and sometimes that translated to looking pregnant in swing dresses but this incredible i am wearing it with either blue strappy sandals or red heels and it is quite the perfect summer dress the material is thick and feels elegant the colors are vibrant today is my first day wearing it and i have already received compliments no kidding wonderful maeve clothing i love you,1
10990,I bought this in the store without trying it in the black when i put it on i loved it so much so that i went back and purchased the black patterned one equally as nice,1
10991,The color is great the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece,1
10992,This romper is so cute and comfy the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots true to the photos i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso but this fits great with shorts hitting about the same as the model image im i really love the vneck on this too its simple but a really flattering cut that i dont think would expose even ladies with a larger chest definitely a nice everyday piece excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa,1
10993,I tried this shirt on on a whim in my local store when i was there to shop the sale items an to my surprise it was very flattering and comfortable it had a unique fit and design i tried on the black in an xs my usual size and surprisingly i didnt find it to be too big at all it fit just like it did on the model you could almost wear it as a mini dress over leggingsshorts based on the length like one of the previous reviewers it would be great if it came in other colors this top woul,1
10994,Such cute tights i saw them and had to have them they are a thick knit very good quality the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color i get lots of compliments on them,1
10995,I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag no fit no drapevery unfinished looking though i bought it on sale on sale it is not worth keeping over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep,0
10996,I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought theyd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe on my second wear i happened to be on a longhaul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper outer thigh luckily id packed a backup dress the pants werent tight at all but the seams wrent strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess poor construction i would not recommend these,0
10997,A breath of fresh air spring flowers easy to wear very feminine and flattering looks great with denim orange reds etc very happy with this purchase,1
10998,Love this sweater one of my favorite fall purchases by far love how it hangs especially the low back its simple comfortable yet so chic at the same time i bought the grey and goes great with skinny jeans and boots,1
10999,The first day i wore this jacket to work three people told me how great it looked its stylish but comfy looks great worn with a tunic and leggings or accompanying a skirt and tights best of all the camel color is a great change from black and as a bonus doesnt show my orangeish labs dog hair,1
11000,Great dress wish it came it more colors would like to buy another one i am size small is perfect unlike one of the previous reviewers i do not think it is too clingy maybe she needed to size upvery versital cute with a jean jacket or long lightweight scarf booties or sandals,1
11001,I love this dressi saw it on the way out of the store and was struck by the gorgeous color and rich velvet fabric and had to touch it and then try it on i did not find it to be tight in the shoulders at all nor do i think it looks cheapon the contrary the shape is indeed boxy but it is still very flattering and comfortable i wore it to a christmas brunch and got a ton of compliments the only drawback for me is that it has to be dry cleaned for reference i am and usually wear,1
11002,Id been eyeing this skirt on the website and was pleasantly surprised to find one hanging on the sale rack in a local store i couldnt leave it behind the silver embroidery and the lovely flowinng weight of the tulle layers make this a beautiful skirt im just over and it skims the floor on me with a heel cant wait to wear it,1
11003,I love this sweater i purchased it in the redberry color it is so incredibly soft and cozy and the fit is fantastic it hugs my curves in all the right places i purchased it without even looking at the care instructions but after reading a couple of reviews here i opted to wash on delicate and line dry it came out perfectly,1
11004,I am obsessed with the quality of the fabric on this top i am giving it as a gift and cant wait,1
11005,This is a great dress for those days where you just want to throw something on but still look put together it hangs so well and feels so comfortable yet it has a style that is a combination of bohemian and part sophisticated the colors are muted but they work so well i wear it with flat strap sandals and have also paired it with wedges i receive tons of compliments and have to make sure my daughter doesnt try to borrow it would highly recommend,1
11006,I wasnt sure what to expect with these pants i couldnt figure out from the pictures what the material would actually be like is it jersey is it french terry is it more traditional sweatshirttype material nope turns out theyre like wearing pants made out of a fuzzy flecked sweater or like the thickest loosest sweaterknit tights ever surprise they are the strangest pants ive ever owned for sure but i actually really like them theyre super comfortable and cozy warm slightly i,1
11007,Colors are much brighter in person fits well not frumpy like a lot of openfront sweaters colors make it perfect for neutrals but maybe hard to mix with other colors pricey so still considering whether to keep it,1
11008,I ordered this in the peach color way it is a nice thicker cotton and while i have only worn washed once i air dried it feels like a fabric that will hold up well fit is good i stuck with my usual medium at first i thought it was a little big but i didnt want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small in the body a small would have worked i am sure so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in,1
11009,After reading the reviews i decided to order this top i was so pleased and when i wore it for the first time i had someone ask me where i got it it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back i want to order it again in different colors,1
11010,One of the sales women was wearing this today she looked amazing then i tried on i looked really great the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person it is comfy cotton the unique hem adds punch able to dress up or down im a true size small fits perfectly medium was very loose and oversized well constructed feels more like a retail pullover highly recommend,1
11011,This bra surprised me by how good it looks on the placement of the lace and cups creates a flattering silhouette,1
11012,Love the lace back panel unique design would not call this bluedefinitely more of a grey color but it is pretty got size small and it fit well lbs,1
11013,I bought this in the neutral motif and my expectations before trying it on werent high but i was sold once i was in the dress sometimes dresses that have the elastic band in the waist can be tricky if you dont have a perfectly flat tummy and can accentuate the tiniest bump however this dress sits perfectly on the waist and is actually super slimming i wasnt sold on the pattern or color i wish it was more off white than brown but the fit was so great that i had to buy it the dress,1
11014,Lovely jumpsuit can be dressed up or down i agree with the other reviewers that in my normal medium the torso length is a bit short making the garment pull i sized up to a large and with room in the hips and the correct torso length the jumpsuit works the bust is cut for a smaller gal for reference i am a lb,1
11015,Ive had my eye on this dress ever since i saw it in a fall catalog my daughters name is tegan and this is exactly the style i love simple when it went on sale i was lucky enough to find it in the green color i wanted at a great price it is so soft and comfortable yet flattering its a must have now i want to get this in black,1
11016,Just a wonderful shirt fabric is so soft it feels like pajamas and the blue is just perfect theres a different blue plaid as a lining and i almost wish it was reversible theyre both great patterns wonderful for fall,1
11017,I got this shirt in red plaid and love it super cute without being too trendy i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments,1
11018,I just got this in the mail and wore it for the first time today it is a beautiful top the crochet portion of it is very well made and overall the top hangs nicely the linen though is a little bit rough and scratchy the lining underneath seems a little delicate and is not stretchy so i felt at moments while sitting that i could have just ripped it with one wrong move the linen also wrinkles pretty easy in the midbelly section so there is an ugly line going across a problem with a lot of l,1
11019,I saw this dress in the store and was drawn to the pattern as an alternative to my normal lbd it looked okay on the hanger but when i tried it onwow so pretty and chic it actually hangs a little lower in the front on me than on the model pictured which adds to the chicness and makes it a sophisticated take on a kimono my husbands words i wore it out that evening to dinner and received several compliments i did not have any issues with fit i am a size and purchased a size it fit,1
11020,What a disappointment and for the price its outrageous,0
11021,The fabric is really soft and the cardi has a cute and comfy slouchy loose fit reminds me of free people cardis with the extra long sleeves and loose fit great to throw on over workout clothes or with jeans and a tee shirt easy piece would size down im getting lots of use out of it,1
11022,This looked so odd on me i decided to give it to someone with a different body type and she found it really odd too the sleeve are a bit too long to be short and they are tight at the bottom the top is really large as to be unflattering perhaps its just that it doesnt work on someone who is petite but this one is a return,0
11023,I am so i feel im on the cusp of petiteregular sizing i ordered p about lbs and the dress fit perfectly its so pretty i got blue i ordered this for my upcoming trip for our anniversaryi feel like i can wear with sandals or heels with leggings or no leggings beautifully made kind of pricey but worth it,1
11024,Very comfortable dress with a gorgeous pattern it comes with a self liner in navy that is very smoothing i was worried a figure hugging sweater knit would be unflattering cut is perfect im a size on top and on bottom and the m was the best fit the neckline is a deep scoop so if you are not busty it may come down too far for comfort,1
11025,I ordered this on a whim as i though hey i dont have off the shoulder tops lets try ti looks cutei ordered the nude after debating but glad i did it is a bit warmer in color and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it maybe i am seeing things it is soft not sure there is wool i am not that sensitive to wool felt soft to mesize i ordered the xxs as i think lately retailer has been making things baggier and on a shorter pe,1
11026,This dress is absolutely gorgeous the fabric is light and comfortable the colors are even more vibrant in person it has a keyhole opening in front which might not be for everyone but which i really liked the only things i would caution buyers about is that it is not lined and for shorter buyers im it runs a bit long so if you can pick up the petite that might mean a better fit,1
11027,I love everything about this tunic dress its versatile and can be styled a few ways loose like a shift blouson when cinched or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe there are tiny beads sequins and subtle micro pleating the fabric is airy and quite delicate be careful the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d,1
11028,I love this tank i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle its fitted without being too tight i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great im not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy casual piece i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer,1
11029,I got this top on a fantastic deal it is comfortable fits well slightly large to size but i prefer that and really ontrend such a great staple i bought in the other colorway as well,1
11030,Beautiful elegant sexy i love the fit can be dressed up or wear with jeans its great,1
11031,Love this shirt i have it in both colors you can wear it off the shoulder or on its baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough you couldnt see i had drains underneath my tank top i am really grateful for this shirt super soft super cute,1
11032,This top is unique and gorgeous im a singer and i knew i had to have it for an upcoming performance its got a really great ethnicbohemian beauty and femininity to it i saw the top online then i went to the store to try it on it is delicate it has beading embroidery and mesh so one has to be careful putting on jackets brushing up against things etc but its well worth it please note that due to the lining it does run small i had to go up a size depending on how youd like it to,1
11033,This is truly a beautiful top the beading and lace are subtle but add such a special feminine touch i love the breezy swingy shape very flattering this is one item i will be sure to treasure for years to come love,1
11034,I know im going to get a lot of wear out of this tshirt this summer i have it in white and its not too see through which is what i always worry about when i wear white shirts its basic but then it has lace on the shoulders that adds something extra i love its drapeits not too form fitting on me im it tends to be a bit long but i like it the shirt being cotton means that its super soft as far as washing goes best practice is to machine wash and hang to dryim afraid of,1
11035,I loved these pants they fit perfectly and then i washed them like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns so sad wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right,0
11036,I tried this dress at the store and fell in love with it but they only had the red dress my size trust me the red is absolutely beautiful but i needed a black dress so i purchased it online i just cant wait for it to arriveit fits perfectly and its so classy,1
11037,When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it upon arrival i fell in love it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places the crop is super flattering appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape,1
11038,I love this dress will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow it fits well the neck line is a bit low on me i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it as shown on model i am and lbs and the small is just right,1
11039,This dress is so cute and comfortable it can be dressed up or down super versatile love it,1
11040,Amazingly soft thin and super warm this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny,1
11041,The blouse is as shown in the picture it falls nicely and is flattering to wear the detail on the yoke and hemline is of good quality ive received a lot of compliments on this top,1
11042,Really cute over my white cropped pilcro jeans or as a beach cover up over a bathing suit i want this in more colors,1
11043,Perfect fit nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag outafter wearing for a short time good lines in back so they are moredressy than a regular legging,1
11044,The color is as pictured good quality its lined the zipper in the back makes it look updated i ordered my usual size small petite size it fit perfectly im feet and lbs hourglass figure i had high hopes i have hips and short heavy legs the skirt only emphasized my flaws if youve got great legs you will do well with this i do own other short skirts but the fact that is less tailored in look makes it better suited for a younger gal if youre on the fence give it a try it,0
11045,I tried the redsalmon color on at the store its a very bright color but a nice one the top is formfitting with soft stretchy material there are two small buttons at each shoulder the sleeves are a good length the boatneck shows a little bit of bra strap but not too noticeable the only thing i didnt care for was the somewhat synthetic look of the material if youre between sizes size up as its a snug fit,1
11046,I wasnt sure if this dress would hang correctly on me and make me look shapeless but im so happy with it the fabric is so comfortable and the tie in the back really helps draw it in so my waist is defined the length is great and its super comfortable but looks polished,1
11047,This sweater is adorable and comfortable but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything i cannot even imagine trying to wash it unfortunately i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor,0
11048,This is my new favorite shirt im actually wearing it today i had to order another in white too grab it while you can,1
11049,Just got both today skirt and top and i love how soft the material is and btw i learned a valuable lesson from past moth sweater purchases dry clean even though the how to care for tag states handwashing dry clean the last moth sweater i washed was not in the same shape it was when i first purchased but i never made that mistake again and it was one of my favesi bought this particular top in the large as i wanted the boyfriend oversized look and i love the way it drapes o,1
11050,I love this dress it is super cute and swingy a perfect summer dress dress it up or even for a fun summer afternoon with sandals the fit is great the armholes on the regular were a little big the petite is much better,1
11051,I rarely write reviews but this one deserves one this top is completely utterly adorable it flows so beautifully which makes it perfect to wear with leggingsskinny jeans i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party and i received so many compliments this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty i love the maeve brand and this is certainly no exception id love to get it in multiple colors,1
11052,I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately some of the items have been disappointing in qualityverses cost this being one the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves,0
11053,I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments not only is this a very pretty style the poncho is comfortable i really glad i purchased,1
11054,Gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts highly recommend both,1
11055,This is a perfect top for warm weather and depending on the accessories you pair it with it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love definitely runs big but thats part of the charm of the top,1
11056,Heres an example of lowering a hemline and slapping the term petite on it too much fabric was bulky and ran too small the fabric was thin and pulled awkwardly over the bust returned,0
11057,This fit me perfectly with a little room but think its meant to be this way so easier to get on and off this feels like a dream and is very good quality definitely a heavier piece but i like that it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy the back is adorable too retailer hit it out of park with this one grab it before its too late im a ddd and size and the large fit perfectly,1
11058,This is a super flattering cute tank ive purchased it in several colors because its such a great fit somewhat thin material and slightly sheer especially the white i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor side boobarmpit fat shows looks great with pilcro capris for a cute casual summer look i wish they would come out with even more colors,1
11059,My husband bought it for me and i was a bit skeptical at first tried it on and absolutely loved it besides the really soft fabric it has pockets which makes it even more comfortable for me im lbs and flat chested he got me a medium which fits a bit tight but my husband likes it so its a keeper,1
11060,I really liked this top ordered the blue and am considering getting the pink color lbs ordered xxs and it fit great has nice drape around hips and not too snug,1
11061,First of all this is not pullover styling there is a side zipper i wouldnt have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for mesecond of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneathnot at all what is looks like or is described as sadly will be returning but im sure i will find something to exchange it for,0
11062,Love the color pattern tiny gold buttons flattering fit quality of fabric and make i got size petite which fits perfectly my husband said they looked really good on me and were keepers im highly recommend,1
11063,What a lovely top the embroidery makes this simple top very special its too lightweight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring,1
11064,Love the easy fit of this dress great for work or family events love the ribbed sleeves and pockets are a plus,1
11065,I debated getting this dress for over a month and finally purchased it on retailer member day for off i wore it on a chiller night with a denim jacket and booties for a more casual feel constant compliments from friends and strangers only complaint about the dress is the slit it does not go as high like on the model stops right at the kneethe cross over is not too revealing which is nice overall the fit is great im and usually size and dd the large was perfect,1
11066,Im not usually a fan of tees as im a little but busty and dont like material that clings the color of this tee is gorgeous though the neckline is feminine and it has it enough weight that it movesnot sure how itll wash but will try to keep it out of the dryer,1
11067,I usually wear a s petite so thats what i initially got in this im c the shoulders were about an inch too wide on either side the sides along the top had tons of extra fabric almost like batwings or a dolman cut and the waist was at least too big im reordering in petite xs and hoping for the best because this is a gorgeous coat,1
11068,The pictures do not do this dress justice this dress is gorgeous the color is beautiful and it is so flattering on even better this dress is machine washable simply hang it up to dry and it looks like it is fresh from the cleaners i love this dress so much i dont even mind that i purchased it at full price and now it is on sale buy this dress for a special occasion it is so special,1
11069,This suit fits like a glove ive had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when im just not feeling a bikini this is it its comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in overall worth the extra splurge im tall too so it was plenty long on my torso,1
11070,I love love love this top the cutout pattern in front is such a unique look and is a great way to add some fun to your usual tshirt and jeans look its well made and the fit is great i got it in petite s which worked great lengthwise,1
11071,Soft elegant beautiful and makes me feel special what more could one ask for fit is true to size and has various styling options best retailer purchase in some time,1
11072,I am feet and i ordered a petite small in moss i have posted a photo below its a pretty green the lining is pretty the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and slips a little when putting the jacket on but it doesnt effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably its floppy but not sloppy i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip it was a nice surprise im curvy and busty i have zero problem with it being unflattering the s,1
11073,Maeve does not disappoint unlike many of the tops and dresses which recently have been billowy a bit shapeless and not formfitting this hugs all the right curves its adorable eyecatching and the pattern is so cute i paired it with nude heels today and a jacket so fun just like the wynwood top in all colors the level of fun and playfulness is unmatched its tts i am and got the thank you retailer thank you maeve,1
11074,These pants are so comfy im getting a second pair i ordered the olive color in a smallreg im thinking of ordering the xs next time since they do stretch out a great deal as the day goes on would definitely recommend these for sure hope this review is helpful as i struggled with ordering petite or not glad i didnt,1
11075,Super cute and simple shirt as other reviewer said lol but she was right i have another shirt from this brand and its one of my favorites it runs true to size its a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall it may be a little short for someone with a long torso andor tall as im only and i wouldnt want it to be any shorter,1
11076,Retailer is my favorite store they always have everything i want and more these pants are absolutely beautiful and intricate in design and the quality is fantastic its stylish and a pair of pants that i will always use and that will last for anlobn time and how can i forget these pants are slimming,1
11077,Perfect fit shirt super cute and very comfortable i purchased a size xl at first but it was too large l fit perfect im normally a size on top but this runs large,1
11078,I love this shirt the pictures do not do it justice intricate detail lovely,1
11079,I can only review the ivory as that was the only color in my local store this sweater is very flattering as it is fitted on top but has a nice flow over the hips plus the zipper allows for more room or to show off an underlying top the material is soft and the ivory is very pretty in person,1
11080,I love this dress my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish but are also very comfortable this dress fit the bill the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online and the fabric is so soft it almost feel like wearing pajamas the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely and so its flattering overall a great addition to my springsummer wardrobe,1
11081,Im lbs dd normally a p or p in pants i ordered an and probably should have gone with a it was super unflatteringthe print was overwhelming for my pale skin it made my thin waist look larger than it really was and rode up the inside of my thighs i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth thats of the price and x as flattering if you have thick legs this may not be the suit for you i returned itso fast,0
11082,I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it i was not disappointed however had i not read the reviews i would have been it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model it also appears to be disproportionate i am and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle usually their items are l,1
11083,This skirt is beautiful i even have the perfect shirt to wear with it sadly though i have to decide between too many nice things what to do i tried on the and it fits me perfectly above the knee waist just right in colors are fun and great for fall but could also summerize the skirtfabric is thick however and wellmade i highly recommen but leave a for me,1
11084,I ordered this in a petite im b waist hips and size p fits perfectly and it fits very well everywhere however i think if youre bigger than b size up because this top is very fitted around the bust the bottom hem falls right below my belly button the neckline is not too low and not too high i chose black because i feel that there are a lot of details and can be toned down with a darker color i think this top must be fitted for a tailored look or otherwise one may risk t,1
11085,Tops are a challenge for me i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent fabric is wonderful it is not too thin and not too thick it does pull up slightly in the wash it requires a little ironing or a good steaming,1
11086,Love these shorts fit true to size and the material is so amazing,1
11087,Like the previous reviewer stated its more like a cape id to call it a capedigan style super comfy loose fit for comfort fabric high quality just right thickness not too thick not too thin snuggly soft doesnt pill with wear design totally retailer cute and quirkiness top of the back has the same gray as the sleeve for continuity and the sleeve has sheep and a fence how cute is that this is a very versatile sweater goes with everything and so comfortable that i reach for,1
11088,Ive been buying and returning several denim shorts lately searching for the right pair these are fantastic they are so so soft and comfy id say they run slightly big but not to the point where i needed to size down like i do with the hyphen chinos love that they are not so short but not too long either and can be adjusted by how you roll them these are a nice medium wash and i am lbs and went w my normal size seems like they may stretch out a little but thats ok bc then they,1
11089,This is a really nice dress for the money i definitely had to size down ive always taken a in hd in paris tops so i initially ordered a but it was a little too big in the chest area i wear a dd so normally this isnt my issue i replaced it with a and it fits great i also have a long torso which can be an issue for me with dresses but this one works on me this is definitely a good dress for taller girls the material is high quality too im going to wear it to my friends we,1
11090,Im with a h chest ive always had a hard time finding clothes that fit well because im chest heavy this fits perfectly without making me look bigger than i am and hides my post pregnancy pooch well i usually order a medium at retailer and ordered a medium in this sweater,1
11091,This dress is super comfortable its s bit long but im so thats to be expected i wanted an everyday dress and i cant decide if the full skirt makes it too formal looking,1
11092,This tee has the cutest details and the green is actually a beautiful deeper green the shirt has a great fit and looks so much more flattering on than the pictures show got an xs slightly loose exactly how i like it the somewhat mottleddye type color makes it a casual piece for me great with jeans nice fabric thickness,1
11093,I love this shirt red navy is one of my fave color combos and the vintage feel is fantastic the fabric is a little thicker and more sweaterlike than i was expecting but its a good thing the top isnt heavy but the knit gives it more texture interestthis is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy lookcovered but formfitting and flattering,1
11094,I thought this dress looked cute online and was excited to try it on at my local retailer it fits so well and is very flattering i really like the material the only thing for me is that i have long arms so the sleeves have to get pushed up but it looks like thats how its supposed to be,1
11095,I got the blue and love the color its bigger than it looks here almost like the model has it pinned in the backbut its swingy and super cute and fun,1
11096,I saw this blouse and had to have it i ordered my usual size large and was shocked at how big it was it looked like a maternity top on me so i sized down to medium it fit much better and i was able to fully appreciate how gorgeous the colors were and how feminine and pretty the mock neck was i definitely recommend it but suggest to size down for a better fit,1
11097,I saw this in the store and was glad i didnt order it earlier online i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person i like more unusual and flattering pieces and this just wasnt it no compliments here,0
11098,I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear,1
11099,This is a very nice turtleneck the variations in the ribbing are a modern and flattering touch in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations fyi there are not all the ribbing areas are the same shade of blackunless you are very small framed i would recommend sizing up or if you typically wear a m or a l go with the l as reference i have wide shoulders wider than my hips large biceps and a b chest and i went with the l because,1
11100,I love these jeans the are so soft so comfortable nice fabric weightnot too heavy or stiff at all very flattering best of all they move with you but do not completely stretch out by the end of the day i am on retailer site now to purchase another color,1
11101,This is a perfect sweater its comfortable practical and lends an elegant hand to a pair of jeans it also hides your bits and stays flattering i have worn it a lot because it makes life so easy and i have not had any issues yet with lace tearingtts lbs b wearing this in size small,1
11102,This jacket is my favorite purchase in a while i used my last month th birthday discount on itit is of exceptional materials and quality construction the juxtaposition of the stripes against the beautifully vibrant embroidery on back is stunning it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece which adds to its classy dramatic flare my size medium came in the european size for reference i am an american size it is comfortable to wear and can easily accomodate large ful,1
11103,Very versatile tanki will wear it with slacks skirts culottes jeans it is soft and the pattern is more noticeable than in the picture i ordered the white and i may order the black too i am lbs ordered in small the armholes are perfect no gap at all,1
11104,When this dressed first debuted i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters add a wide leather belt when its opened or closed works great either way when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum i knew this would be an ideal pair,1
11105,So soft and comfortable,1
11106,Was very disappointed with this dress its very baggy no shape felt like an oversized sack purchased in med bust area was only semi good fit all else flopped,0
11107,Cute light summer dress wish it worked for me the tank part of the dress is light and super comfy the bottom part of the dress is narrow and a bit fitted doesnt work for a curvy bottomed girl,1
11108,I love love this trench i bought the grey and it goes well with so many other pieces i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend its a great layering piece for the san francisco weather im adjusting toit does run a little big but i dont mind because it gives enough room for layering im short at but still stuck with a small a small petite probably would look great as wellhei hei consistently makes great jacketstrenches,1
11109,I love this sweater it is so soft and the pink is such a sweet shade it is large and falls of the shoulder but thats how it is designed to fit it is my new favorite sweater,1
11110,Ive been looking for colored pants and these are the besti am typically a or in pants and the fit well i tried on the rose color and loved those the fit was great though they wouldnt be long enough on me if i tried to unroll them though you can i liked how they fit my butt hips and thighs which is usually the most important part i find that lots of colored pants accentuate the cellulite on my thighs too much but that was not at all the case with thesethe fabric is,1
11111,Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color will have do to the nice quality and wear very stylish for a loooooong timea must have for the summer,1
11112,Love this dress purchased in white runs true to size made well,1
11113,Absolutely gorgeous top i have purchased so many retailer tops and this is the st review i have ever written this top is just that deserving for a review stunning in so many ways i am lbs and purchased a size fits perfectly maybe runs a tad small can not wait to wear,1
11114,This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases i wore it to work and a presentation many people commented on how much they loved my top and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasnt paisley but leopards and tiger prints its really fun and fits well great for work or dressed down with jeans,1
11115,Love this top it is super flattering with a long floaty body i usually wear a but sized up to a due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a would have fit as well,1
11116,Just bought these they are my fourth pair they are comfy flattering and versatile i pretty much live in these cargos on the weekends,1
11117,I got this dress on sale under dollars but i would pay more it runs very large i got a medium which is roomy irl i wear a large vanity sizing i suppose the colors are so pretty it is lined so you dont need a slip or cami highly recommend,1
11118,I loved this dress so much i got it in colors i had to send it back twice to get the size right i ended up with a medium the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival it is dryclean only overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute,1
11119,I bought this dress because it was cute swinging and lightweight seemingly perfect for this hot nyc summer after on wash and dry the dress is already ripped around two buttons ill still wear it but i dont think itll last until next summer kind of pitiful since it wasnt a cheapo dress also it is big but that seemed to be sort of the point,0
11120,I bought this jacket in white specifically for summer it is the perfect weight for the office air conditioning coolness i wore this jacket with a sleeveless silk blouse and summer skirt it just looked perfect for a dressier summer outfit i take a ml in retailer jackets and went with the large in this because i have a large bust d the medium fit but was just a tad snug through my upper backfront area the large gave me a little wiggle room so i could wear a little heavier blouse undernea,1
11121,Can i tell you this top is amazing get it quick before it sells out,1
11122,Great quality and beautiful color i wear size and ordered s got lots of compliments,1
11123,Byron lars knows how to make you look like a woman with his magical dresses i decided to get the navy i also own the soldout marguerite aka carissima in bronze instead of the black or white since everyone and their mother owns it already the lace of the top is differentmore delicate but less intricate its still very beautiful my body type is inverted and the dress is hourglass so the size p fits great on top but loose on my hips and rear im going to keep this dress and do mo,1
11124,Love the fit and color but the material is my favorite its so soft and comfy feels like your walking around in your pjs,1
11125,I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful its actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture theres different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small d so it runs tts and i didnt find this overly blousy myself though thats just part of its charm youll need an undershirt or something,1
11126,The front cream panel is completely transparenti didnt purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneathi wish the fabric were translucent not so see through,0
11127,I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket basic goody binder and there is a circle stain where the binder was so strange i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them they are ruined i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them,0
11128,Boxy short wide luv this brand but super disappointed with this design,0
11129,Ive worn this twice now the first time was after trying it on and realizing it was perfect immediately purchased and never took it off the second time wore it to my internship office followed by museum and a concert incredibly versatile constant compliments pounds c waist meant to be loose carefree incredibly modern does wrinkle after long periods of sitting but not enough to dislike the biggest complaint for me and my retailer coworkers is that it is an incred,1
11130,Love love this dress fits so great i normally wouldnt have picked this dress more preppy than my normal style fits amazing my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else ive ever owned the fit flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts,1
11131,This is a great uptodate twist on a musthave staple a black or grey cardigan easy flowing and flattering style and warm enough for fall weather,1
11132,I usually wear a in pilcro and for these i have to size down to a the was very large in the waist they are a great dark denim color and look cute with the bottoms rolled up a little,1
11133,These are my new favorite jeans the gray wash is nice and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work the rise is high enough that i dont need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button and the description is true they dont stretch im a loyal ag stevie shopper and the fit on these is similar just a little skinnier in the ankles maybe true to size a little long so ill probably hem them a couple of inches,1
11134,It is an expensive panty but so worth the money it is so unique and flattering,1
11135,I had been on a white jeans hunt for some time pilcro is one of my favorite brands and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit if petite had been available that would have been better in length but it was not so i had them hemmed,1
11136,This top is the bomb the red is a perfect balance of washed out but still rich the thin spaghetti straps and scooped back make it sexy but it still looks effortless perfect to pair with light weight light wash jeans its also nice that its not clingy at all lends to the casual look total keep for me,1
11137,Very high quality fabric and the fit is excellent the skirt is stylish yet simple and very easy to wear as i feel i would have no trouble paring it with several different tops it can easily be dressed up or down and is excellent for work i got this on sale and am so glad still it is one of the few items actually worth the initial high price tag great quality,1
11138,Omg so comfortable and feels like wearing nothing at all i wish the blue print was still available in my size tried them on at the store and fell in love they say the length is however i am on the tall side usually wear in jeans but these are perfect i see from other reviews that these pants have been around for a while please dont change them and i will be getting another pair or two next year,1
11139,I love the fabric and design of this dress you will definitely get noticed and its comfortable just slip it on and go,1
11140,This dress is gorgeous the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up bonus a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing even with the deep v neckline while the waist does sit a bit high it works perfectly on my body emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away it drapes nicely not too full and not too clingy i am and a true size,1
11141,The photos really doesnt do this sweater justice when i saw it in store ii was really drawn to the colors which are a bit brighter than they appear in the photos this will be great over jeans or slim pants i usually wear a l or xl and i went with the l which is still roomy enough to layer but not too big at it drapes nicely and covers my rear end the arms are a bit long on me but it is a common issue for me as i have short arms others have mentioned the arms being big but i think the,1
11142,I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch see try on and order through the store which is much appreciated i am normally a size xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured herei mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee,1
11143,This is quite an odd dress it does wrap and is beautiful material however the dress does not close at all in the chest area i thought perhaps it was meant to be a kimono it will go back for sure,0
11144,Weighs nothing so comfortable great length not too short fits a tad loose but very pretty and easy to wear fun print flattering casual style with a touch of class lbs and the xs fits just as it shows on the model,1
11145,I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it the fabric is made of cheap poly thats shiny thin and clingy it shows every lump and bump you have the zipper at the back wont lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump the sewing and hemline is uneven there wasnt a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline,0
11146,After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size i got my top size m i usually wear ml depending on the style im ft tall lb i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists no wonder there is such a low leap in price it is a good quality though and very nice pale peach color no would not recommend unless you wear xxxl,0
11147,This item is huge im normally a medium sized down to a small still massive couldnt go too much smaller because the buttons would pull at the chest but the sleeves are very wide as is the waist way too much fabric i had high hopes for this one but it just doesnt work for reference i love billowy and flowy tops but this was a tent,0
11148,I am a frequent retailer shopper who has found many items to be hit or miss this ones a definite hit i absolutely love the vibe of this sweater wrap unique bohemian feminine cozy the fabric beautiful intricate weave high quality knit wearable virtually yearround thanks to air conditioning how stylish it is fringe very in kimono cocoon cardigan how much of my wardrobe it goes with neutral ivory color that can be dressed up or down elegant or casual and the fact that it has,1
11149,I love these pants these pants are perfect if you like a slim style but cant comfortably wear skinnies i like the heavy weight corduroy fabric and seaming details i bought the wine color but as pictured it really is rust or copper colored which i prefer,1
11150,I love this top fits great n is elegant great for the workplace n a night out absolutely beautiful quality fabric love love love,1
11151,I really like the style and cute stripes and i love the versatility of the design of this shirt fits true to size and hides my stomach just in the right places,1
11152,Love this dress it is superflattering and the embroidery is beautiful,1
11153,Looks fitted on but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on the fabric also felt cheap,0
11154,Very comfortable looks good on like the fabric also,1
11155,I ordered this months ago and it finally came off back order a huge disappointment the fit wasnt so much the issue for me the quality of the wool is subpar someone else mentioned a quotfelted woolquoti guess is that what you call it it does literally feel like felt super thin itchy doesnt drape very well and feels cheap made in china i got it on sale but still not worth what i paid definitely going back,0
11156,The stitching on this dress is absolutely beautiful and very detailed,1
11157,This dress is great its easy to dress up or down and is comfy,1
11158,This dress is beautiful it is longer than it looks on the model im but drapes beautifully it is perfect for a wedding or a special event i love it,1
11159,I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person the description didnt give as much information as i wanted so im going to be very detailed in this review i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time and ill have to hand sew others on more tightly my usual size is a pxs or p and there were no petite sizes available however the size fits perfectly no alterations need,1
11160,I tried this on in the store and had to have it this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything im a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves i highly recommend it,1
11161,While i thought it looked really pretty on the hanger when i tried it on it just felt like a mess perhaps it suits other personalities and bodies i hated that the zipper was in the front i personally find it tacky and gawdy while the patterns are pretty the material felt like some weird fabric wallpaper and i didnt see how the price was justified with how the material felt cheap to me,0
11162,Wonderful and comfortable dress very sweet,1
11163,Amazing dye so uniqueyou can put in washing machine no prob make sure you put in dryer with a non static dryer sheet for the dress to be super soft,1
11164,Love this dress the fringe makes it so special its a little shorter than i anticpated it hits me right about where it shows on the model and i am i love the length cant wait to wear this,1
11165,I ordered the dark turquoise skirt and it fits perfectly the materials is a very high quality corduroy and the color is beautiful i really like the buttons on the front as well gotta love warm skirts for colder climates,1
11166,This dress is so flattering not the usual type of dress i go for but decided on a whim to try and am glad so glad i did the material has enough heft to give you a beautiful silhouette without being too clingy you can dress up or down if you dont like showing too much cleavage you may want to put a tank underneath to give you a little coverage,1
11167,This dress is just lovelyi love the pattern and the cut and its very comfortable to wear i like it because i can wear it just about anywhere and its appropriate you can dress it up or down i get lots of compliments when i wear it,1
11168,Very unique beautiful piece drapes well accentuates curves in a classy way this is an eye catcher definitely,1
11169,I found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer they were the very last pair and in my size i couldnt believe my luck i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans thyre soft yet substantial they retain thier shape love the worn in look to them so adorable nice slouchy skinny jean i stayed true to size,1
11170,I had to have this jacket looks much better in person i bought the navy color the fit is great it has a flowy bottom and is unstructured i wear a dark navy t shirt or cami underneath great with jeans and over the knee boots or booties its a bit heavy and bulky to wear under a coat,1
11171,These pants are perfect they are exactly what i was looking for and worth every penny the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim but still i think i could wear these any season they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t so excited to have these in my closet love a good pair of fun pants,1
11172,I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended not so for starters the top is much more of a beige in person a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully secondly there is just so much fabric it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like ive tried to hard to make it work lastly the,0
11173,Absolutely adore this dress soft and comfortable fabric ankle length but could be knotted in the front to be shorten i am usually a s but had to buy an xs the neckline may be a bit too low if you are flatchested if you happen to see this gem in stores it is a must buy it will sell out completely in two days some customer went back to exchange the next day that it had arrived instores but it was sold out so we had to order it perfect for all seasons and layering,1
11174,I live year round in warm weather and found these pants to be a great addition to my wardrobe flattering and comfortable the cropped look is a nice alternative to shorts im curvy but athleticlbs i usually wear an or in retailer but took the i prefer my pants a little less fitted,1
11175,The cut of this dress is gorgeous and it could be great if it were made of quality silk and was lined although the color is beautiful the cheap fabric has no variation is too saturated and lacks any sheen of quality silk shocked at the price i still have beautiful silk dresses from retailer pre being back the quality,0
11176,Great fit love the mid rise my usual size in these leggings hug in all the right places they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt below my ankles i may have them hemmed after theyre washed just wait see,1
11177,I found this fit tts for me im normally a and took a fit and length are great the fabric felt substantial and the colors are soft,1
11178,I fell in love with this top sweater before it could even be ordered was on model for pants that were available to order in any case i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person the blue also contains fibers of wine so very pretty the gray is a soft shade the quality is lovely too the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous however that said,1
11179,Love the blouse and the best part is the back side this brand never ceases to fall short for fit and style try it on to see,1
11180,Fits perfect,1
11181,This can be worn now on its own or as the weather gets colder it will make a great layering piecei bought one and liked it so much i bought it in another color,1
11182,Terrible fit for a longer torso runs small in hip and lining huge in the waist not good for an hourglass figure,0
11183,Ive been eyeing this dress for months so when it went on sale i finally purchased it now i see why its on salethe dress runs extremely large and has no shape looks like a potatoe sack and i feel like moomoo in itthis will be going back to the store,0
11184,Awesome basic top for your wardrobe its a little sheer but not too much,1
11185,Online this looks like a great sweater i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured in fact im pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer unfortunately this sweater will not work for me as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look pounds heavier,0
11186,I love this top and its so pretty in person knew it would be full but was hoping it wouldnt be too big its perfect and looks good with jeans,1
11187,I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch very retailer it does run slightly smaller but not in an extreme way id love to see more styling options for this top because im a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts haha,1
11188,This top is so flowy and has a great fit i can see wearing it lots of different ways it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down,1
11189,The dress is beautiful on the model in person its sheer but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great i am and the petite was too short and the regular too long both are very boxy and seem to run big even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size,0
11190,This top is so much better in person i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy it is not and i have sensitive skin i love this top and have got lots of compliments,1
11191,Love this top especially the back the back makes the whole top,1
11192,When i tried this top on i started laughing the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton which instead of falling by the hips juts out like wings its also huge cute idea wrong material and placement,0
11193,This is a fun and classic dress the dress is well made as others said it doesnt have much give i am a c and the size fit perfectly i didnt experience any gapping between the buttons it is a nice fun summer time dress it is also very flattering,1
11194,I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping i liekd how it looked on the model read the reviews and wasnt sure so waited then my usual size sold out so i decided ot try the smaller size in petites otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect the color says black but it looks more mifnight aka blue my friend even said when i tried it on you know i laways love anything blue so dont expect dark,1
11195,What a great top i am lbs with a d chest and this top looks and feels great on i am usually a and the small fit perfectly i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color the v in front hits in a great spot not too low but just low enough to look feminine i havent washed and dried the top yet so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews but i find this top really works for me so i am glad,1
11196,The concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice the inner layer is sheer but as long as youre wearing a nudecolored bra no big deal however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy they mustve photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top because it looks like it hangs straight on her i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package it clearly flares out is aline so as a previous reviewer stated it looks huge from the front if it had fit the,0
11197,I got this in the royal blueit is absolutly beautiful,1
11198,Ive been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer and this is it the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty im small busted aa with an athletic lower body think lb marathoner and the flare of this dress is perfect i ordered this in a and a petite the petite size looked littlegirl short the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress im on th,1

11200,I have thicker thighs and dont usually find that i can wear this kind of thing these on the other hand are hot hot hot and are even somehow slimming for my thighs i just adore them im waiting for the green color to go on sale so i can buy them too,1

11202,I am a teacher and love finding cute comfortable clothes i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long i felt so stylish and i was still able to do what i needed to do,1
11203,This tshirt is great it fits really well and is very flattering the colors are nice including the tshirt color itself the fit is perfect including the sleeves and its very comfortable my only concern is how well it will do after you wash it a few times,1
11204,This dress is absolutely like a layered cloud the material is amazingly soft and comfy,1
11205,This dress looks and feels classy and expensive every time i wear it out i get compliments on the color and style,1
11206,I loved how soft this dress was as well as versatile however i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams unfortunately the fabric is so soft but rather thin and it didnt hold the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldnt put it in the washing machine again especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because its so old and barely agitates would love this if it was made a little be,0
11207,Gorgeous color fabric and cut i ordered the blue in a i always wear a p or large petite in retailer i purchased a regular its a full size too small in the ribcage cannot zip it up ill be exchanging mine for next size up even though im the length is fine if youre tall it might be pretty short for you,1
11208,I tried the red version at store it fit really good and i loved it then i found the blue version online and liked even more it can be worn for business and casual,1
11209,I love this top i had no issues with fabric it is soft and light the wrist details are very pretty i love the buttons it fits true to size and it is a good layering top i got the red which is true to the picture not looking red but a bright coral color,1
11210,I dont understand the negative reviewon this sweater it is nothing short of stunning the quality and design are absolutely beautiful and i love the lined pockets i can honestly say i dont think ill ever part with it this is a sweater you hang onto forever i will say it runs a bit large i ordered the xssm and if i didnt know better i would think its ml either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online do it it is worth every penny especially for the s,1
11211,I tried on an xs and it was boxyroomy in the torso and the pocket on the wristforearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person it took me back to my childhood i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois shammy for short that was awesome for soaking up water and thats what it felt lik,0
11212,Ive been trying to find a pair of tasteful destroyed jeans for the summer im also petite i love paige jeans already since the ankle length has worked very well on me i saw these jeans in store tried them on and loved them like other paige jeans they dont stretch out especially if you size down but even then you dont get that sausage feeling of wearing pants that are too small the material stretches in the waste,1
11213,This is a great quality product with unique design,1
11214,I just bought this dress in the store and i love it im in my s and it does every thing i need a dress to do it has sleeves its modest enough and shows my shape the colors are great and go with most shoes im heading to italy soon and this one will see me through many museums and churches great buy,1
11215,This shirt is very flattering which is not the case for all peplum tops vneck is appropriate for work looks great with jeans or khakis highly recommend only con is that the material is quite thin lbs and xs fit perfectly,1
11216,I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal,1
11217,I purchased this top in white it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one i purchased the xs but wish i had bought a s the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons for reference i am weigh lbs b bra size jean size and small boned i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist my normal weight is lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh,1
11218,Ive had a lot of misses from retailer lately ive loved this dress since i first saw it in the springsummer releases and gave it a try when it went on sale when it arrived i literally lol its an ill fitting nightgown the size small was a tent on me and its so flimsy and sheer it probably shouldnt be worn in public theres a short sheer slip that comes with it but unfortunately doesnt do much pass ladies,0
11219,I adore this sweater is it a bit itchy yes do i care certainly not enough to send it back great length hangs nicely unique without being gaudy great purchase,1
11220,These jeans immediately caught my eye online and when i saw them in the store on display i knew i had to at least try them on they are absolutely adorable i love the uniqueness of the buttons at the bottom great fit and great stretch i wore them for the first time today and i had at least four people i didnt know approach me and tell me that they liked my jeans,1
11221,Perfect for work or a night out packing for europe wore it out on a saturday night with leggings and heels layer it after yoga got it in all colors love,1
11222,This cardigan is made of nice materials and is lined but it is boxy and totally unfitted i swim which means i have large shoulders and this thing makes me look like a boxing champion well a fat boxing champion as it has not wasteline the sleeves are too long and as usual retailer saves on money by using little cheap hooks instead of buttons as a closing system so if you choose to close this cardigan it just looks awful,0
11223,These are awesome classic style and quality youd expect from ag the midrise is nice for moms like me that are not interested in lowrise jeans tts im with a curvy bottom and wear a which is my normal size in ag,1
11224,Wow i didnt think this dress would work on my curvy frame i still have a baby belly and some dresses look like mumus on me this was so flattering the waist cinches nicely and the length is just above the knee i am and lbs for reference the weight its lightcottony and it looks great with flats and wedges love it,1
11225,I ordered this online and the colors are prettier in person the blue and gray contrast nicely and have a beautiful sheen to them i am usually a at retailer and while that fit i felt i could size down i am slender and since it is a shift there was little room in the waistbutt area i ordered a and that fit perfect if you love blue like i do this dress is for you,1
11226,Really gorgeous print i purchased these to go with the top also recommend it as well and i love these i have a larger behind and its nowadays it seems to find swimsuits with full coverage without feeling like a diaper these are it there is elastic at the leg openings so that may be uncomfortable for some but i found no problem with it for reference i am usually a in pants and i purchased a medium,1
11227,I love these jeans perfect amount of stretch without sag great color ordered my usual size i wish they had these in olive and black,1
11228,This is a great easy to wear summer dress a denim jacket would look adorable to wear on a cooler night it runs a bit small in the waist and i bought the petite because i wanted it to be above the knee summer casual it is very flattering because of the pattern detail by the waist it is the perfect summer dress and best of all it is machine washable,1
11229,I love the pilcro stet pants want them in every color every season please retailer never stop making thesepants i also love the new addition to the family the pilcro capri pants would love every color of these too,1
11230,Love the crochet detail on the back yes it does show the bottom band of your bra i think im okay with that i had on a magenta colored bra when i tried this on and it was a nice pop of color i think the top runs tts to slightly big if youre in between sizes i would go down i am a b and i ordered a size so i havent tried on the but i think it would fit too and not be quite as loose in the arm hole area im sure this top will sell out before it hits sale,1
11231,I went into the store to buy this in white after seeing it on the website i ended up with the bluegray color the white was completely see thru could have worked as a swim cover but not at this price for me the blue on the other hand is fine the fabric is soft and hangs nicely you can definitely dress it up with some booties and a belt or keep it laid back with flip flops im sure ill wear this a bunch this summer the color is versatile enough that i will pair with leggings and boots,1
11232,This cut and fit is so good i sized up because my body just needs that with pullovers generally and i was glad i did it fits just right,1
11233,Dress runs a little small tight on top so i had to exchange from a size to a size originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense the material is light and soft flowers are muted maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute,1
11234,This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it i am fairly small usually a or in tops and smaller on top barely b this top was incredibly unflattering falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy like a pillowcasesacklike fit there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me its unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders a nice transition to fall unfortunately,0
11235,Tried this little number on in store i am years old not a bad body gave this a shot it looks minus my slightly wrinkled knees great and very close to what it looks like on model very happy with one,1
11236,I guess this is a true to size i am usually a dd and ordered d fits great the back is really pretty so even though it is a tiny bit looser i decided to keep it,1
11237,I love the way this top fits i am busty on top and smaller on bottom and it really flatters its funny to see it called off the shoulder bc so far i have worn it on the shoulders when worn on the shoulders the neck is very flattering kind of like a cowl neck i probably would not wear it off the shoulder bc of the whole bra strap challenge i got the charcoal color which looks great with jeans or black leggings,1
11238,I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday as they always seem to be out of stock now i know why these are soft comfortable and slimming theyre somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spansthey dont fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being paininducing,1
11239,Gorgeous top very nice detail work soft and flattering i dont think its too full on the bottom at all mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette word of warning soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink and definitely not my color if peach isnt flattering on you heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade bummer that i thought the other reviewers might,1
11240,This was my first dress purchase this year quite late ive been disappointed with a lot of polyesterrayonviscose dresses so far if its silk or cotton its quite expensive this dress meets all my tick marks no synthetic beautiful pattern wellmade flattering to the figure i have a silk slip so the absence of lining was not an issue for me fits true to my petite sizing its a very easy to wear dress no tugging with straps or a belt its slimming and skims the figure properly,1
11241,The pullover is very light weight material so great for fall or spring it hangs nicely in front and back and is slimming i ordered a medium other than the sleeves are not as long on me as the model it fits perfectly,1
11242,I must disagree with some of the other reviews when i first saw this dress online i loved it and couldnt wait to try it on i didnt order it online because i read some of the other reviews and so i wanted to try it on in the store before i bought it because i was nervous the fit wasnt going to be good they were so wrong maybe it just takes a certain body type i have an hourglass figure and im tall i tried on a size and it fit beautifully the waist is very form fitting and t,1
11243,These pants are really great the fabric is soft but substantial and the fit is so comfortable i bought the grey color its a very light grey almost a stone color its a perfect neutral to wear with just about any top you may have i love the deep front pockets and the elastic waist is an added bonus im lb and purchased the small,1
11244,When i wore this the two times i did i got a ton of compliments it runs small and is a bit tight when sized correctly but its really stunning after the second wear the fabric under the arms frayed and its now unwearable i have to return it and am so disappointed sadly i would not recommend buying it for that reason,0
11245,I adore this dress its so charming great quality lovely fabric beautiful color the fit is supposed to be boxy and probably wont work on a beautiful curvy body with a petite athletic body i feel beautiful in it i wear a small or xs and i definitely needed an extra small pair it with black or camel sandals or boots its lovely,1
11246,When i saw that these were on sale i was actually going to order another pair as i have really been enjoying them and wear them quite a bit unfortunately the large that i take is sold out otherwise i would own two pairs although these are called lounge pants i put them together with white or black accessories and have worn them everywhere since my legs are not long i did have to shorten and they are still a bit longer on me than the model however it was well worth it,1
11247,Its a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost its shape very disappointed i am going to return top,0
11248,My personal opinion is that i am not a fan of this top the material of the fabric doesnt seem as nice as delettas other tops and it had a really boxy fit on me i wanted to love this top but i did not,0
11249,This top is very flattering the fabric flows and moves it fits perfectly slim cut but hides tummy bulges and other imperfections and its slimming too can be dressed up or down goes with everything i ended up buying all three colors and if there were more i would buy more,1
11250,I have worn this dress with a jean jacket birkenstocks or a dressier wedged sandal it washes beautifully and is super soft would buy in different colors if there were more options looks better in person,1
11251,Love love love this shirt great quality washes dries wonderfully it is loose and flowy its supposed to be that way but it lays nicely its longer than pictured which i love im sure im shorter than the model but its truly a perfect shirt goes great with my jean skirt jeans shorts and dressier skirts if you get a chance to order dont hesitate,1
11252,These leggings are soft comfortable and go with everything love the way they feel,1
11253,I really loved the colors and style of this top unfortunately it runs a bit small and was too short on me im some mentioned they didnt like fabric but i thought it was good,0
11254,This is such a simple dress to throw on that will give you instant wow factor you can dress up or down but know that it is completely flattering head to toe i am in love with this dress,1
11255,I wasnt planning on loving this dress when i tried it on i loved the the color which is what prompted me to buy it this dress fit perfectly it hugs my body without feeling tight the ruching is perfect i didnt want to take it off its also very comfortableim lbs and the xs petite fit perfectly the dress hits me at the same length that is pictured i think it would be easy to hem if you wanted it to be shorter i have a short torso and saw no issues with that as some reviewer,1
11256,Very intricate detail with stitching love the contrast of black on cream has slits on each side bought it for holiday parties just what i had hoped it would be,1
11257,I am glad to add this very versitile top to my wardrobe it can be worn with a sweater in the cooler months like i wore it today a business jacket or alone in the summer i wore it with a fitandflare skirt today but it goes with pants jeans shorts etcfyi i am a cd short waist broad shouldersback size m in knit tops in fitted or ones with buttons i purchased my normal size m in this topi have no real waist so the shape of the top really does help to make one for,1
11258,I ordered a medium in this and it definitely fits more like a large i liked the color the sleeves but tying the tie at the neck looks silly on me and leaving it open shows too much cleavage overall it is just shapeless and too much fabric on me im sending this one back,0
11259,I usually have a hard time with the sizing as retailer carries so many designers but this dolan top fits absolutely true to size i am an xs and it fits perfectly drapes exactly as shown and overall looks exactly as pictured the color is an offwhite with gold beading and tiny white sequins on a mesh overlay which is lined so there is no showthrough which i was concerned about it is not boxy due to the fabric which is very soft and drapes nicely over your curves there is just enough b,1
11260,This is a favulous capein fact i would buy another if there were other colors it is oversized playful chic dramatic and simply put a true statement piece it will not be flattering to your figureit is not suppose tobut it will show your true sense of style wish it had pocketsi may add them for more play,1

11263,I love these bottoms they are super cute comfy and very flatering finally a bikini botom i feel comfotable in after having my babies its just high enough to cover my stretch marks on top and the ruffles cover the one down low and fits loosly enough to avoid a muffin top i am normally between a size and ten lbs and i ordered size large,1
11264,This cardigan runs slightly large as it is boxy which i love the color is exactly as pictured and it is soooo soft cant wait to wear it with a tshirt and jeans,1
11265,Great little dress for a picnic i am a dd and didnt have a problem buttoning the dress unlike another previous reviewer i had purchased a size my only reason for return was the price and my wallet otherwise this wellmade dress would still be in my closet love the buttons,1
11266,I wanted to love this dress so much so that i ignored earlier reviews and purchased it in two sizes to see if i could make it work the fabric is gorgeous but the fit was very unflattering its too large on top and hangs awkwardly in both sizes i considered tailoring to make it work but with this pattern i felt like that would be a compromise in the end i returned both sizes ast the fabric couldnt compensate for the very unflattering fit,0
11267,Just purchased this for a midsummer formal wedding i am lbs ended up going with the size for extra room the felt very snug thru the chest,1
11268,I wanted to love this but instead of being a flowy kimono top as pictured it was a thick blazer type garment not at all what is pictured here unfortunately also it was much shorter than pictured and i am only love most retailer styles but this one was a miss and a return,0
11269,I recently purchased this blouse on their off sale in white i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway it is awful there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning it feels like a napkin or thinner not even worth the extra sale price i will be returning,0
11270,I have many pairs of ag jeans mostly stevies harpers and while theyre comfortable i am always glad to take them off at the end of the day these jeans are different the fabric is very very soft feels like its been washed worn dozens of times but the color finish of the jean looks polished spiffy enough to wear for evenings out or casual friday and the fit is perfect once i went up a size slim and figure hugging but not at all constricting my regular stevies always fe,1
11271,Perfect slimming fit wore it to work and then on to a holiday party received multiple compliments throughout the day and evening,1

11273,Yes yes yes i buy a lot of dresses from retailer and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks this dress is iti bought the white linen version on a whim i never buy white dress because i dont want to look bigger than my pear shape already is and i like red wine and i thats risky in a white dress i dont know how this designer did it but this dress is amazing its slimming and flattering and summery and current and i am two sizes bigger,1
11274,Really pretty blue top great for wearing around the house if you want to be comfy and casual yet look good in case your neighbor shows up at your door of if you have to run a quick errand if your wear it with distressed jeans it will add to the casual vibe the blue is vivid and perfect for any hair color dont get me wrong the top is casual and cute it is not sloppy and has an international worldly vibe i recommend it,1

11277,So i wasnt sure about ordering this skirt because i couldnt see it in person first but im so glad i did the skirt and design is well made and doesnt look or feel cheap the color isnt blaring offensive red so it worked with my pale skin better than i anticipated i wore it to my daughters dance production with tall boots and a sweater and i got numerous compliments fit is true i am and i picked the petite length the skirt has a slight aline rather than a tight pencil fit but the,1
11278,I went to retailer for a pair of pants and walked out with this tunic in the blue motif and the pilcro cords in dark turquoise this sweater like the one i purchased last season by the same designer is well made and the fabric is luxuriously soft like cashmere soft am so excited that the weather is finally cooling down to wear it,1
11279,Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top i was pleasantly surprised the green is even more vibrant in person just gorgeous typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small still a tad roomy but portland doesnt carry petite sizing aaaaandidontwanttopayforshipping remedy that retailer portland,1

11281,I got the purple motif and loved the colors and the feel of the fabric i am and lbs d the small was too big and there were no xs or xxs,1
11282,This dress was cute in the photos but wore like a sack when i put it on great quality fabric was lovely just a little sparkle at the hemline scallops were great but i put it on i immediately took it back off and put it back in the sack to return love the look it just was terrible on me im petite and weigh so im not large but the dress made me look like an oompaloompa,0
11283,I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything definitely runs largei have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big long running in the sleeves though i was comfortable with keeping it its a soft comfortable shirt the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks styling i love the shirt and im glad i got in on it while i did,1
11284,Like the crossover design of this sweater the vneck is not low cut and can be worn without cami sweater is thin but not find it to be see through although i always were tank tops under my shirts did not find it to be itchy,1
11285,I love this piece i purchased it on sale months ago and when i wear it i just love it it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect its very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing im very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices thx retailer,1
11286,Absolutely beautiful usually dont leave reviews here but this top material beading style is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didnt i have a short torso so the peplum hit me above the bellybutton its very voluminous but with the right pants and heels it is a perfect outfit as a fulltime student im apt to find retailer expensive but this purchase was so very much worth it in terms of sizing i initially got the s to accommodate my bust f but preferred the xs,1
11287,I found this while shopping at my local retailer and loved it i was able to size down from my normal to a i got the warm white and its lovely couldnt wait to wear it the detail is so pretty and love the buttons and length sleeves i am thrilled i couldnt be happier,1
11288,This is a crop top but super boxy and wide i expected it to be more fitted in the waist since it sits out away a from the body a lot it was not flattering i also felt the stitching to be a bit matronly for me too bad as i am having such a hard time finding tops and im willing to pay full price for something that works,0
11289,I followed everyones advice in the reviews and ordered up one size i have a inch waist but size s and s in pilcro hyphens usually fit me i ordered the in this skirt and it fits perfect its form fitting at waist and hips and then flares out but im curvy if you are straighter it will be looser around the hips i love the length it hits me mid calf so a bit lower than it does on the model im tall the fabric is soft but has no stretch its cotton there is a,1
11290,I purchased two pair navy and sky for a trip to the caribbean and im so glad i tried them on in the store these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far would highly recommend well made too,1

11293,I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again these liner socks actually stay on my feet others brands ive tried before slip off my heel but these stay hidden and stay put plus a fun design,1
11294,Based on others reviews i knew i needed to try this beauty on to be sure of my size as others mentioned it runs sizes large but unlike others i dont feel i need a belt at the waist i am d and with my body style super short and not super slim in the waist but also busty this is the perfect boho fit and the perfect drape and the design and quality are superb to boot,1
11295,Love this top very easy to wear to lunch or site seeing the fabric is soft and drapes nicely,1
11296,I ordered xss i usually wear medium in tops and coats the next size up wouldve been too big so this cape does run large,1
11297,This is a very lovely looking sweater unfortunately it runs incredibly small im only and the size small hit me above my midrise jeans it doesnt fit at all how its shown on the model its also a very delicate fabric seems like it would snag easily i was really hoping it would work as i used my birthday discount to purchase it but im sending it back,0
11298,I was excited to get this shirt in the mail i liked the pattern a lot but was so disappointed when i tried it on i am lbs and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt despite the excess fabric the shirt pulled open in the chest area making it a complete fail im sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric especially since shes small on top ther,0
11299,I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it in my normal size and took it on a vacation first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is prewashed i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was overall it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware,0
11300,I have featured photos below im feet and lbs and d i purchased a small petite the fabric is cotton i thought it would be rayon it is lined with cotton fabric the skirt has major poof it falls like a midi on a petite the waist runs high which can not be a good thing for a busty gal why do i love it the pattern is one of a kind the colors are so fall i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look i cant resist this skirt if your tall this is a dream if your petite you can,1
11301,I love the look of this top my original order was returned because of a defect but the customer service was wonderful they took it back at the store and sent out another one right awaythe style is very flattering and the quality of the denim is excellentlove the back zipper as well,1
11302,I found this to fit really well and ive got a chest and the hourglass to go with it the stretch really helps it to be comfortable too i reckon its pretty versatile too,1
11303,I have this shirt in more than one color i totally disagree with the first review i find this shirt to be super comfy and unique i personally feel the material isnt scratchy at all also i love this designer they are one of my new favorites,1
11304,I just purchased these pajamas online and they are very pretty in person i found them to be tts in my usual size small though a bit on the long side as im only i dont mind a little extra length though because these are just to loungesleep in i think these soft pjs will be great during the warmer months as they are very light weight and comfortable youll absolutely love the print on them and wish there was a matching top,1
11305,This is an awesome tshirt and im so glad it finally went on sale i had been eying it for a while its true to size can be dressed up with nice slacks or dressed down with boyfriend jeans washes great and looks different from other shirts the ruffles on the bottom really make a difference gotten lots of compliments,1
11306,This is the perfect dress for it being a long maxi its surprisingly lightweight the built in slip it covers everywhere you need it to without detracting from the overall look of the dress i absolutely love it and wish it came in other colorspatterns,1
11307,Love this shirt very flattering fit on my pear shape also accommodates my larger dd bust without straining on the buttons ever so slightly sheer fabric but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra,1
11308,This top fits nicely lays nicely and washed nicely i purchased the same shirt in other colors because it was such a great purchase i am short and it was not too long and not clingy,1
11309,This top was gorgeous and fit perfectly right out of the bag with only a quick ironing unfortunately the first time i washed it cold water hang dry it shrunk so that it no longer fits across the bust without tape where it was once roomy is much shorter and feels rougher to the touch like another reviewer said unfortunately after i had purchased and washed i wish the label would have just said to dry clean only because i regret washing it and would have done otherwise if i had kno,0
11310,Someone else mentioned that this fit like a grandpa sweater and they were absolutely right its definitely loose fitting but its really cute and well made i usually get a medium size in topssweaters but after reading the other reviews i ordered the small and im so glad i did its the perfect casual cardigan i wish it came in more colors,1
11311,I love this shirt it is so different from most things i get but such a fun change the colors are bright and fun you totally do not have to be western to enjoy this shirt and its fun for a good country dancingpartyconcert too my roommate has already asked to borrow it as in shes wearing it at a concert as i type this it is incredibly comfortable i got the xs and was kind of surprised it still felt a little big but i kept the size to wear it half tucked or even kind of oversized i w,1
11312,tags sewn in small about long and huge about x very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags not comfortable at all also i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup so for me this would only be a lounging bralette if it wasnt so itchy,0
11313,These pants are so great i was debating between them and some sateen denim style pants from another store but these definitely take the cake the fit is awesomealthough i am a in the green and a in the black so thats kind of weird,1
11314,Im so upset that this didnt work out im petite at and ordered this skirt in petite however i felt like it swallowed me up the fabric is thick and warm so this is definitely only cold weather attire im the picture it looks like there is a little leg showing but on me i feel like a schoolmarm sadly this is going back,0
11315,This is not my usual style but the print is gorgeous and the dress is really high quality im glad i purchased it definitely runs big i am usually an xs or s depending on brand but i ordered an xs p it fits pretty well and falls at the perfect length just above my knees im its a little shapeless still but thats the look im still sort of wondering if i should have gotten an xxs but the xs p definitely works especially for the length cant wait to wear this amazing sale pri,1
11316,Ive been moving toward a simple tee and jean wardrobe and this is the perfect addition its so fun and different and so comfortable ive been loving retailers new tees it runs a little large but in a cute way,1
11317,Lovely dress the beautiful colors are exactly as shown on the website im and it reaches about midway down my shin im normally a size and i ordered the xsmall and it fits perfectly definitely a keeper,1
11318,I love this dress its beautiful and flattering not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch i couldnt see it in the picture but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer so you have to be careful with underwear choice i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length i am short and appleshaped and it was a great choice,1
11319,I tried this dress on in the store and loved it i am not a aize usually a but the dresss aline shape allowed me to get a size the dress is well made and the orange beaded work is lovely a very pretty dress that i will wear a lot,1
11320,I recently purchased this tunic and love it its not to big hangs just right arm holes are not to big and the material is very comfortable looks great with white jeans shorts or just jeans i will get a lot of wear all year round fits true to size oh slimming too,1
11321,This swimsuit is beautiful the quality is excellent controls without being too thick the colors are bright and the pattern is gorgeous i am curvy dd and the top fit perfect good bottom coverage very happy with this purchase,1
11322,The skirt on this trench has tons of fabric it goes on and on and drapes and twirls beautifully as a trench it fits well and does the trick i believe the skirt is heavy enough not to blow around too much but i havent been out in extremely strong winds yet it fits true to size at the knee im i sized up because i assumed i would be layering it over clothes my regular size fit fine over a lightweight cardigan,1
11323,I was so excited about this top and so disappointed when it arrived today the lace part is lovely but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated and there is no way to get it to lay flat the back center section is pleated why couldnt they have had the pleats all around this will be going back with much regret,0
11324,Beautiful cardigan but it does run large im about lbs normally a large in tops and the medium fits great its still a bit roomy but i think this cardigan is meant to be a tad roomy i agree with another reviewer that its a bit itchy on bare skin but its wool so thats a given overall a great cardigan for fall,1
11325,For once i found a peasant top that wasnt a balloon im and curvier on top and the small fit great the blouse billowed a bit but it didnt make me look like a hot air balloon the pattern of the blouse a mix of various floral swatches is very pretty the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall i cant wait to wear it,1
11326,This dress is gorgeous i took the advice of a previous reviewer and tried one size down it fit perfectly i am usually between a or in retailer dresses depending on the cut the size in this was great i am near the small chested side a b and there was still plenty of room in the top the swimmers on the dress are embroidered and i didnt really notice until i saw the inside beautiful detail the dress is a lightweight cotton and great for warm weather its even more flattering to be a,1
11327,I am in love with this skirt it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give it hugs your curves but doesnt cut in anywhere i was able to easily go down a size from my usual i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well,1
11328,I had been searching for an almost s style dress and i saw this one and instantly loved it i wind up sending back so many things i get through retailer but this dress was everything i hoped it would be i got the green one with the white dots very comfortable it just out a little with the hips because of the cut which is very s stylingit makes the waist look more narrow,1
11329,Love this bought the cream in store and the burgundy online perfect alone or to wear under an retailer sweater,1
11330,This is one of my favorite purchases everfrom anywhere one of my new years resolutions was to stop wearing work out clothes all of the time this is as comfortable as any work out jacket and looks classy can be dressed up or down its warm flattering and unique,1
11331,I am in love with this dress the colors are amazing but also is the fabric it is soft and supple i am a curvy girl and this dress does all justice to my bust waist and hips this is truly an amazing dress you can dress it up or dress it down and the best part it is professional enough for a causal office look,1
11332,Love the versatility of this dress looks better in person,1
11333,I purchased the blue with white dots the shape was awful but looked like a sack returned,0
11334,Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky these fit the bill not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are i instantly knew that i had to have these look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived i sized down a size and the fit is perfect highly recommend,1
11335,Ordered this top online as i loved the colors and design but i should have listened to the other reviewers i ordered my usual size m and it was just very unflattering it was short and wide not at all like its pictured on the model needless to say it was immediately shipped back,0
11336,These joggers are soo cute they fit greati seriously love them i have worn them so ofteni may have to ban myself from them for a weeki am and the length was perfect for a jogger panti got an xs because the small looked too baggy the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect,1
11337,I bought a medium my usual size and had to exchange for a small i love flowy sweaters but this one truly fits one size big the arms and body of the sweater fit larger beautiful sweater with jeans or legging cant wait to wear,1
11338,Not sure where to start with this topits that good i am usually a large in most maeve tops and thats sizing up for extra flow i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders i wanted more flow as always so i went up in size for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have it has sold out with,1
11339,I love this top in fact if it came in more colors id buy a few more its just so soft and comfortable wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights the neckline is perfect love the subtle details it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath yes i love it just wish there were more colors,1
11340,Love the versatility of the dress very easy to dress either up or down ive been able to wear it out for a casual day with a denim jacket and booties just like the stock photo or even wear it to work with a black jacket and flats the color is beautiful and the material is very soft and comfortable absolutely love the cut and design of the dress on top only thing i would mention is that the dress is a bit form fitting than expected it definitely hugs your curves,1
11341,I got the brown one and im very please with the softness of the thread and the light weight feel of the fabric,1
11342,As others stated it was a tad bizarre to have a mock neck on the spring dress however i would wear this in the fall with boots and a nice moto jacket another but is i wasnt sure about the color i am very pale and the pale color is pretty much my skin color however the blue flowers and black lace make up for it as far as colors and everyone liked it on me lastly cut wow this was just really nice on very flattering i usually try on regular size in store and order petite but th,1
11343,The material is adorable and if it was available in a blouse with sleeves i would buy in a minute we have a pool and i thought it would be cute to wear while entertaining now the cons i am long waisted and this strange tie knotted high under the bustline giving an odd lumpy look it runs short and i cant imagine who thought this design was a good idea there were no reviews when i ordered i am learning to try it on in the store andor read the reviews before investing i would say go up a,0
11344,Very pretty but too short for my age looks well made and green dress is beautiful it was just too short for me to be comfortable wearing,1
11345,Fits like a glove and looks amazing on it fits so many different body types but yet is flattering in all the right places i got p and have a smaller chest and hip but it really gives a nice shape got compliments all night when i wore this to a formal dance but i could see myself wearing this again and again for holiday parties or other occasions,1
11346,When i saw this dress the model was standing in an outdoor setting and i fell in love with it but then i noticed the model in an indoors photo the dress looked different as i studied the difference it was the way the plaid fell on each dress the one i liked fell more vertically giving it a slimming effect and the others were horizontal giving it a widening effect so i went to my local retailer to see they had the one i liked on a dummy it is tts and the plaid matched perfectly the front flo,1
11347,This dress looks great with bright color but size runs small,1
11348,This top is everything i wanted it to be the fabric is beautiful and the fit is flowy and comfortable i would love to own a uneckline version,1
11349,I really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me made my curvy body look shapeless also had a button crack before i even put it on returned it,0
11350,I purchased the green print which has so many patterns and colors which makes this dress have a very interesting look i love that it has a drop waist because it is so flattering to most body typesthe other thing i liked was that this dress came in petite sizes perfect for me,1
11351,Dress was a disappoint very thin and cheaply made not worth the money at all pictures make it look much better than in real life top area is also made small so if you are busty this is not the dress for you,0
11352,I love this top its not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams its super soft and comes in some great colors i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee,1
11353,Love this top the material is so comfy yet it looks dressy great for a night out with black pants or a skirt im ftinches and a small fit perfectly which seems true to retailer sizing flattering yet hides a little post holiday belly i wore a nude rackerback bra with the top and that works perfectly with the design,1
11354,This is a great shirt that goes with everything its super sexy and i have to saythe girls look great in it i bought the black first and went back for the green the quality of the shirt is greatnot cheap and no smell at least not in my experience like was mentioned by another reviewer i cant say enough about how cute this shirt is,1

11356,It is my favorite piece in my closet right now it is cute it feels like a pillow i just want to sleep in it but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off,1
11357,This has been my go to top every time i go out lately i just make sure i am with different people the length is perfect and not too long i wear a strapless black bra and you cannot see through the shirt the only thing i dont like about it is the three buttons in the back at the top are very very difficult to button,1
11358,I absolutely love these shorts they are the perfect length too i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years its hard to find shorts that arent super short yet arent bermuda and are still flattering i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighsmidsectionrolls are not sewn on both ends so youll have to reroll each washwish you carried these basics at all times,1
11359,Purchased these jeans in a and i am usually a in skinny jeans i got the s on but they were snug these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist great jeans,1
11360,Im so sick of all workout tops being baggy they look sloppy on my frame this top is ultra soft and fits great the blackwhite one looks more heathered grey in person i ordered an xs as all tops lately are just huge on me i should be a small and i will be returning for that proper size,1
11361,Beautiful piece that i loved from the day i received it in the mail lots of compliments just a fun pretty outfit,1
11362,I have a large cup size and year after year i am in the search of the perfect suit that supports but doesnt look matronly this year i had a baby and wanted to move to a one piece but still wanted to feel sexy and youthful i thought there is no way this suit is going to look good andor support a ff but gave it try because of all the star reviews i tried it on and my husband just said wow this suit hugs you in all the right places and actually supports i dont know how but it doe,1
11363,This is one of those pieces of clothing that is destined to become a wardrobe staplethe fabric is soft and generous the chiffon trim gives it swing and stylei just ordered another one because i know it is going to be a long time favorite,1
11364,I love how feminine and interesting this top is what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward,1
11365,This is my favorite top im a d and usually wear a medium or large i love this paired with skinny jeans or my level blue shorts,1
11366,Beautiful warm vest originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small i love that it reversible and has a hood,1
11367,This jumpsuit is great i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable im usually a medium i wasnt sure if i should size up i ordered the medium and it was the right choice great light material for summer and nice neckline,1
11368,These are just perfect exactly as pictured if not nicer very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months,1
11369,I work with children and have a casual dress environment this top gives me much needed style to my work wardrobe,1
11370,I was on my way out the door when i noticed this adorable tshirt and of course i grabbed one and went to try it on i love it its a different take on a tshirt its comfortable and stylish i ended up buying the white one and gold colored one im even thinking about grabbing a couple more colors,1
11371,I am and pounds and ordered this in an xs the sweater is enormous the material is also scratchy and not soft at all im disappointed with retailers sizing this year ive had to return a of xs items because they are huge really disappointing,0
11372,I really wanted the dark grey but it has been sold out in my size for many months i finally ended up with the navy i think they are much cuter in person the color nicer also i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd i got my usual size and the fit was perfect they stretch just enough i would get the second pair in a heartbeat,1
11373,This is a super cute top the online image does not do it justice the scalloped edges around the arms give it a flirty and feminine look i got lots of compliments when i paired it with the shorebird pencil skirt the material is thick enough to not make it seethrough and its pretty tts,1
11374,Like other reviewers have said this is very sheer look at the sleeve in the picture and youll get an idea of how sheer the body is as well the material posed challenges for its creater because one top i tried on in the store had a sleeve that was smaller than the other tight enough that it would have ripped if i werent careful tried on another identical top and the sleeves were a normal somewhat loose fit bodice portion is much more intense pink in real life loose billowy and perhaps,0
11375,Super cute but the fabric was so thin flimsy i was afraid it would fall apart once it was washed so returned it,0
11376,These were my go to work pants i have pairs so disappointed that you are not making them in tall anymore i will have to look elsewhere when buying pants please bring them back,1
11377,I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in it does not disappoint the flowers are so pretty and it has great style there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape i cant wait for it to warm up and to wear this,1
11378,Beautiful fabric great quality fits true to size love them,1
11379,I am now on my third pair of these pilcro hyphen chinosthey fit my body type well which is pearshaped they are super comfy relaxed and my go to pant i love that they are a pop of color with what i am wearing vs just a normal jean i cant say enough about these pants,1
11380,This dress is very very flattering which i was a little surprised about because i have a smaller chest it is pretty long coming to right around my knees and i love the buttons i would say that the quality is not there it is very thin material but i am still very happy with it i really wish they made this dress in other colors because i would buy them in a heartbeat it is a perfect summer dress and i cant wait to wear it,1
11381,Love the shirt and style shirt looks better in person than online picture i would get a size down because it runs a little big,1
11382,I am in love with this dress its super soft flattering and comfy i want to wear it everyday it was recommended to me by a friend who is taller and slimmer than i am so i was skeptical of the fit sometimes you see things that are only meant for models to wear so not true here i am pounds with slightly broad shoulders and i bought an xs im considering getting a second one,1
11383,I just received this shirt in the mail and im in love it isnt your average tshirt in that it has character and class i cant wait to wear it another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasnt as dramatic as the picture im not seeing it i think the blue stands out very well i know i should say hurry and get yours before theyre gone but in truth id rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt,1
11384,The look is frest crisp with a touch of romance very retailer,1
11385,I absolutely love this top especially for fl weatherits soft and falls just a tad longer in the back and is a little fitted in the bust area with a very feline looki had the tank as well and just love the satin trimi will say it runs a little smaller than the tank bc i have xs in the tank and needed a small in thislove it,1
11386,Per the other reviews i sized up and got the medium it was still tight around the girls and im not that well endowed but too big in the armholes the fabric is a kind of thin tee shirt material i kept it because im lazy but not sure how much ill wear it given the strange fit,0
11387,This blouse is beautiful and true to size i was so happy it fit after ordering it online im a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly length was perfect on menot too long and not short im for reference definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats love it,1
11388,I couldnt be happier with this skirt i was expecting a jerseytype material but was pleasantly surprised by the thicker textured higher quality material the ruffle on the front is such a cute feature this skirt moves and flows very nicely when walking it is lined and has an elastic waistband its super comfortable so far ive paired it with a bright red knotted tee and a sheer white sleeveless buttondown i receive compliments every time i wear it im lbs i ordered an xs a,1
11389,As usual this dress does not disappoint looks great with boots and is the perfect day to date dress,1
11390,Great staple item i have it in multiple colors and like them all easy to add statement necklace to change up the look wear it under cardi or jacket to make it not look tent like,1
11391,I am in love with this top i saw it online and i was a bit nervous to order it because its a little pricy for a tank top and i was worried it was going to be too short on me i was so wrong the detail on the top is so beautiful and looks even better in person it hit me right at mid hip and looks so cute with jeans and sandals i sometimes get frustrated with the cut of the arms with retailer clothes because they are cut so low that you see your bra when you lift your arms but this top is,1
11392,Would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves im average size and a mother of the medium was not a true medium the fabric was amazing the arm holes were too openlow cut for my taste im and this landed mid calf not my preference retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under weeks from receiving it,0
11393,I love these jeans when i saw them in my retailer store i instantly fell in love they fit like a dream and they look so much better in person than online theyre definitely a boyfriend fit so if youre between sizes go down a size ive already gotten tons of compliments,1
11394,Love this top super comfortable great fit and really pretty colors probably going to buy it in multiple colors it fits so great,1
11395,These pants are true to size whatever that means anymoreim a in paige and ag im weigh around have long legs and i ordered the p the zero petite are still a little long with a slight heel theyre perfect they dont have stretch in them but do to the fit and fabricthe material does expand because theyre thin and breezy i absolutely love them cant wait to order other colors of the same style these are my new favorite pants,1
11396,This is a highquality swimsuit that can be worn inside out easy to wear colors fantastic pattern placement the other side is an intense blue i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site i think this should look great on athletic figures the back is lowcut and the bottom has medium coverage not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms not ideal for hourglass figures as there is no bust support and you will show quite a bit from the side it is cut in at the front w,1
11397,A season top that compliments jeans dress pants shorts skirts lightweight and double layered so should you go without a bra the girls have protection emphasizes nice shoulders length just covers any belly flaws im a and could have gone small or medium here,1
11398,I ordered these because of the side zipper but they zip in front even though the order listing and bag label called them wine side zip pants they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material what bothers me is that i was charged to send them back even though the product description and the name before someone changed it on the website were wrong,0
11399,I bought this in blue and love it i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses i ended up with an extra small petite in this it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough i highly recommend the dress if you size way down,1
11400,This top is soft and comfortable without being some shapeless drag with too much fabric i did size down as did the other woman in the store with me i can see many more wears out of this top wish it had been made in other colors or white would be beautiful,1
11401,One of my favorites for comfy cute this summer the color is a beautiful berry color also love the length it feels a little longer than a typical top which i love,1
11402,Gorgeous material great length for tall girls warm without being too heavy super soft i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extrasmall i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year not sure if its vanity sizing this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple elegant and sophisticated the grey is that nice soft grey that doesnt wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions great,1
11403,Cute casual skirt i love that it is longer in the back than the front so i can comfortably wear it to work i had to size up which i usually do in bottoms that do not have stretch because im my athletic frame,1
11404,It looks like you are wearing cargo shorts really unflattering avoid buying this skirt,0
11405,Fabric felt and looked cheap hem was completely frayed all the way around perhaps purposely but ratty looking all the same,0
11406,I havent owned a denim jacket since college but i felt inspired this season this pilcro jacket is perfect a little distressed along the edges tailored fit and i love the cozy collar looks expensive fits really well,1
11407,Havent worn it yet but i am loving this top it is much prettier in person i sized up to a med based on reviews and it looks like it runs small i didnt try it on until i got home and probably could have done ok in a small but will keep the medium so its not tight across my chest the knit material that makes up the arms and back is thin which is my only complaint if it was slightly thicker it would look nicer and im sure wear longer im happy with my purchasethe colors fabric embroi,1
11408,Very attractive and well fitting absolutely recommend it,1
11409,The color of this top is amazingmuch more vibrant than in the photo and the fit is perfect it is very flirty and pretty and the detailing around the top is gorgeous its pricey but i splurged and am glad i did it looks adorable with a corduroy skirt and boots for the fall,1
11410,Great fit im petite and bought size my hips and waist differ by so im very curvy i love the fit and look just by rolling them up my st pair of ag jeans and i will definitely buy more,1
11411,These pants look beautiful when you first see them it goes downhill from there the waist is very small in relation to the rest of the pants it felt fine when pulled up but it is a struggle i could get past that but when i looked in the mirror i could see right through them no lining and not very thick material for this price a real bummer especially since it was a birthday gift,0
11412,Great jean i will live in these this winter so flattering bum looks good leg is slender and lengthening perfect petite jean with a flared leg,1
11413,This dress is gorgeous its one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is i found it to fit tts although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam it fits perfectly if you have a bigger chest d i would foresee this dress being too snug however i am a c and it fits just right i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo,1
11414,This is a beautiful skirt but runs very small i usually wear a size and could not get the side zipper closedat all,0
11415,I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return it is a very weird fit very thick ruglike material and unfitted the shoulders are bulky the top is big and the booty is small i am c and typically wear a small the arms were very long way too long i will say other than that the top was true to size may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum,0
11416,I purchased this shirt in black luckily it was on sell it can be dressed up or dressed down its so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans i got it on sale too i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style,1
11417,Purchased this maxi dress in blue print size petite xxsmall even in that size i have some difficulty finding dresses that fit but this one does perfectly no complaints at all length is a bit longer than pictured on model but thats fine for a maxi summer easy style dress i am quite short besides being petite so this fits the bill am sure it will be worn quite often for many different occasions,1
11418,I absolutely love these pants i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper ive always liked the look of these pants but didnt think i had the body type to pull them off being with some curves i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips the draping isnt as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didnt add weight to my frame the mate,1
11419,This skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long the length is perfect for a more conservative look i dont wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size,1
11420,These pants are so great they fit as expected and are a nice skinny crop but nothing too tight the fabric is very soft making these pants incredibly comfortable this was my first pair of the stet crops but will probably buy another pair in the future,1
11421,I got this tunic in the bright red and it is a great fun color that leans just slightly to the orange side of red my computer screen makes it look more orange than it does in person im happier with the actual color the fabric is soft comfortable and hangs beautifully wrinkles fall out when you hang it up i also have the tegan tunic in colors and find the fit to be the same however the hilow hem on this dress is a little more exaggerated than on the tegan the tegan travels very w,1
11422,The horizontal lines on the skirt and top gives the wearer and very nice dress i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly the fabric is thick and stretchy,1
11423,I love this dress its cool and comfortable in this crazy heat the fabric has a great feel to it i do wish it was just a little longer im and bought a medium,1
11424,I bought these in white not a harsh white more softlooking and am very pleased with them they are true to the manufacturers sizing i own another pair of pants from elevenses in the same size which runs somewhat large im tall weigh pounds and the size fit perfectly the back of the waistband is elasticized so theres some give theyre long enough on me that they hit the floor with heels theyre perfect they look as pictured but what you cant tell from the photo i,1
11425,I wanted to love this dress it really has no style i was expecting the smocking to be fitted but it just hung i considered going down a size but i think the lining would have been too tight had to return it,0
11426,This didnt work for me the piece looked cheap rode very highneeded to be longer the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece this went back,0
11427,Beautiful flowing feminine dress runs large size down hot pink color well made,1
11428,I absolutely love this top cute and feminine without being over the top i basically love everything meadow rue puts out thereand this was no exception,1
11429,It was bit on pricey side but it was love at first sight i couldnt let go after i tried it onit is soft lightweight moves with me keeps me warm not just from top upit feels silky to the touch and is very versatile and stylishruns true to size and it expands a bit the more you wear it,1
11430,Great sweater beautiful detail warm and cozy i will wear this well into spring because its a nice weight for cool spring evenings the knit pattern is beautiful and will be great for casual wear and dressy occasions as well,1
11431,While i love the design and shape of this blouse the fabric was of very poor quality i will return it,0
11432,One of my new absolute favs so elegant and flattering the dress is as appears online and it is true to size i purchased my usual size with waist chest bc note that there is not a lot of give to the fabric so busty women may need to size up purchased with the minuet necklace,1
11433,I really liked this dress in pictures online i wanted to wear it to work on casual fridays everything about this dress was a disappointment especially at this price point the fit was weird tight in some places too loose in others im usually xs or s i ordered this one is s its made out of a fairly thick and warm material yet the neck area of the dress is more exposed than it appears in pictures especially in the back making it awkward to have this very warm dress with neck upper b,0
11434,Unfortunately does not look anything like in the picture looks like an oversized house robe i expected much more but was disappointed i am definitely returning it,0
11435,I am short so this ends up being really long on me but i like that i can show off some amazing heels with this skirt lately i have been getting into grey so that it puts more attention on my accessories the cut of this skirt is amazing and the thick waistband is nontraditional which makes something that normally would be boring really stand out plus it helps hide baby fat the fabric is a medium weight but it does flow nicely and it does not seem to wrinkle easily which is a huge plu,1
11436,This dress is beautiful the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up i also like loose fitting clothing and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler,1
11437,I agree with the last reviewer this is a great cozy sweater i took an xs regular and i am lbs the pin is used to close the sweater no button plenty of handknit sweater vestswrapsshawls come with or are given with pins for closure you will find many uses for the pin but as it is shown in the photo not likely,1
11438,I picked up this tee in store where they had a pattern that isnt pictured here purple floral on a grey background this is a loose fitting tee and usually the loose fitting tees i try on at retailer are really unflattering however this one fits great and is flattering the fabric is wrinkle resistant and comfortable this top will definitely be a staple of my spring and summer wardrobe considering ordering in other colorsfor reference im lbs measurements ddd,1
11439,I got this in black size medium my usual size i am fairly curvy on top and found the shape in that area very flattering to my figure it is shown as being rather drapey in front and indeed it does fit rather large at the bottom indeed through the body itself since im slim there i will have to tailor it am used to this considering i have to buy to fit my chest but im keeping it for sure as i love the fabric and i think it will become a staple of my wardrobe good job retailer,1
11440,I tried these on at the store and thought the color texture and style was very nice but i needed the petite length so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite darn the regular length hits me just above the ankle so i suppose it is still doable but i hate to pay full price for something that doesnt fit quite right maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it,1
11441,I was pleasantly surprised with this cardigan i get so many compliments i can easily see me carrying this into my fall wardrobe,1
11442,This dress is the best of all worlds sophisticated modern and flattering i was surprised that the dress is actually two separate pieces a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season i had two babies backtoback and am not back to my prebaby shape but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it,1
11443,Love the print of this fabric the length the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary,1
11444,I purchased this sweater at my local retailer store a few weeks ago i picked the dark grey color which is more of a neutral beige or oatmeal color i love it i just wish i had purchased it earlier to wear through the fall it has a substantial weight and is warm this sweaterponcho has a great drape that is really flattering especially in the back it does have slits on the sides so you really would need to wear a layer underneath ive worn it with a turtleneck and buttonups and it looks rea,1
11445,Dress is nice but cant be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself it is around in length so is more of a tunic than a dress im only and it was too short cant imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this,0
11446,Bought this in navy in the spring and this fall in green i am and with very long legs and they are too short to be work appropriate as a dress at least for me i wear both with leggings short boots and a variety of jackets and love them they feel like butter against the skin and are incredible comfortable recommend for reference im about and an athleticstraight build and bought m in the blue and l in the green go figure,1
11447,I purchased this in the black in an xl i am typically a dress size and i would say this runs tts with a flowing fit on the bottom the top is fitted but has some stretch to it absolutely gorgeous fit and quality i love this so much i want to purchase the teal color a spring must have,1
11448,I loved this dress as soon as i saw it online but the price was high and i was nervous about taking a chance on a knit dress would it be too clingy too stretchy too scratchy toowrong i took a chance on it after reading other reviews and as soon as i tried it on i knew i had found the perfect dress for winter it is super comfortable and the quality of the knit is very good the material is soft and warn the dress looks fabulous with bright tights and high boots in the two weeks i,1
11449,Sadly going back ordered m light color option very difficult to pull over my head not a good sign got it on and neckline looked attractive height wo being a mock turtle but whole thing a bit small around middle could order the l but im not liking the feeling of the fabric it feels tight with restrictive and nonuniform stretch cotton poly acrylic and rayon spandex contrast which must mean the stripes combine wfact that the two wide stripes are right at my middle,0
11450,The fabric on this top is just so soft its a thin cotton knit and drapes beautifullythe top runs tts butit is tailored to the body its not loose and wide in the width the length hits the top of the hips just as shownthis works for casual or dress for dress i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is btw i bought this in black which is why adding the pin glams it up although i bought it in black its not sheer so a cami isnt needed,1
11451,Great fit and very flattering if you have curves perfect to throw over just about anything ive only owned it for days and have worn it four times,1
11452,im tall with a short waist and long legs and this skirt came all the way down to my ankles i would have kept it if it had stopped midcalf like in the photo im and the size fit me perfectly in the waist hip area so i would say it runs true to size the buttons lay nice and flat over the tummy so thats a plus at least you dont have to undo them to go to the bathroom,0
11453,I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors but when i took this off the rack to try one you can see through both layers of fabric i thought insulting quality for the price i imagine the holes would start after one wearing,0
11454,I wanted to love these they are cute and warm but they have absolutely no elasticity im so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store,0
11455,Ive been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out i love it i was afraid i couldnt pull it off because im and very petite but i dont think it matters it feels so light and airy and i cant wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts great piece,1
11456,I was so excited for this dress but sadly it did not meet expectations the gauze fabric already had several snagspullers in it the underslip was very short and just cleared my derriereim i normally take a and ordered this in a l it was somewhat clingy in the hip area but yet bulky on top also i like to have the first button open but you could then see the v neck of the underslip and it looked hokey its definitely a thicker material than the previous plaid tunic holding,0
11457,I bought this dress in the green it runs big i usually take a s and had to return for xs i am and it flows beautifully and can be dressed up with heels or worn completely casual with flip flops worth every penny,1
11458,This skirt is very comfortable and moves well im and ordered a p which fits perfectly the length hits just above the top of my feet the patterned chiffon is sheer and the skirt has a short black slip underneath that ends just above my knees i have a small waist and wider hips but found the inner slip to fit loosely enough so that it doesnt ride up when i walk or sit the two slits on either side were a great length and make this skirt both flirty and quirky youll get tons of comp,1
11459,These are long easily wear with skinny jeans they do not cling and are not see through the colors are great,1
11460,Wow love this skirt and i totally agree with reviewersthis item runs a full size small i am normally a true six on bottom and it was a bit too tight considering i would washdryshrink the size eight is perfect fabric is very good twill and forgiving and off cannot wait to wear my bargain skirt next summer,1
11461,I feel like im cheating when i put this on its so comfy almost like wearing cozy pjs but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like im lounging at the same time i wish this came in more colors,1
11462,I purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time it is such a lovely soft tee with a delicate flower design i wear it with jeans it always makes me feel happy,1
11463,I bought this top in every color the fit is so flattering and just flows so nicely not too big love,1
11464,This is the perfect sweater for early spring lightweight but not too thin im lbs the medium fits perfect,1
11465,Love highly recommendusually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge so flattering,1
11466,I love this dress it is very cute and comfortable and great for football games everyday wear it is a little long which is great for me since im taller,1
11467,I was so bummed when this came inthe colors and print are beautiful but the neck is super itchy because of an elasticruffle combo there is also a liner which is a nice touch but its significantly shorter than the top layer which drove me nuts definitely going back,0
11468,The heart version is very pretty i cant speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short the xs was a little big on me the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me like length not to elbow as shown on model but i dont want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that sizefor reference i am lbs dd chest in waist and short,1
11469,Absolutely stunning the color the pattern the quality i love everything about this top,1
11470,Everything about the dress is worth it its true the buttons are loosely sewn on but thats easily fixed im a slim person but broad in the shoulders so i had to exchange the small for a medium because it has a narrow fitted construction largechested ladies or athletic types should size up,1
11471,I bought this dress for fall and will get a lot of wear out of it the fit is perfect loose but structured plan to pair with booties over the coming months,1
11472,Whatever happened to sizing pretty print and color but has enough fabric for tops it is also unlined which is not a huge issue i wore it with a cami the arms werent too gaping for me thankfully i tried to make it work with a wide belt but i will have to get it tucked on the sides i am lbs and got the small should have gone or even sizes smaller,0
11473,I love love love this brand these people know how to cut and construct a dress im appleshaped and have trouble finding fitted dresses that flatter me but this one makes me look curvy and hides my flaws the pattern lays perfectly and will make you look great the fabric is highquality and fullylined its perfect for work or for going out i love that its black and bronzey because i can wear it with black or brown accessories im generally between a lxl in retailer and the l fits wel,1
11474,This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on exactly what i was looking for feminine dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous very comfortable on the skin very flowy so it doesnt have a heavy quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front i completely fell in love with this dress this is a little number to keep for many years,1
11475,I ordered this sweater in a s and i am happy with the sizing i am and athletic build it is not a long sweater and looks just like the sweater on the model i typically like longer sweaters but this will look great with a pair of flare jeans and a nice belt,1
11476,I just received these pants and they are really cute they are casual but i think with a cute topjacket and heels they can be appropriate for a fun night out or casual date they are really comfortable but they do stretch so size down for sure i am and weigh lbs and wear a in antho pants that arent chino fabric but wear a in designer jeans i ordered a and can probably wear a when these stretch out i will keep the but they will be baggy i ordered the kakhi and the,1
11477,This was my first time ordering or even knowing about retailers what a pleasant surprise i will shop often,1
11478,This top is fantastic something about it has an ease of elegance and grace the overall structure and design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to wear i feel immediately put together and ready for anything the fabric has great texture and flows well without feeling like the wind will carry you away i purchased the offwhite it is a bit seethrough but i dont mind wearing a cami underneath,1
11479,This is a unique blouse it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago it is a gorgeous item it does have a boxy fit but it is not unflattering i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice,1
11480,The gorgeous coral color of this skirt makes it a great all seasons skirt the slightly heavier weight of skirt makes it extremely adorable for fallwinter pair it with some tights chunky knit and booties good to go very flattering one has a slight aline cut to it i love love this one,1
11481,This sweater is so unique not for the faint of heart but its beautiful hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired the colors are saturated vibrant love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back the front material is slightly stiffer i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but im willing to overlook it will be a great sweater for the holiday season wear it with a skirt jeans skinny cargos endless possibilities,1
11482,I absolutely love this dress i have received so many compliments the quality is incredible,1
11483,I tried this on in the store in a regular medium and the size was fine just the length fortunately retailer will ship for free if you need a petite im so excited to get this im and a bit busty and the medium fit perfect its very flattering and so comfortable perfect for a hot summer day or as the cute clerk in the store had it styled with a cropped jean jacket and a fun necklace the styling ideas are endless im waiting by the mailbox for it to arrive,1
11484,I wanted to love this as i love holding horses but it fits weird slender in arms but baggy in the torso i will be returning,0
11485,I am lbs and the petite fit perfectly the length was great too as one reader noted the zipper can be a little tricky but dont let that deter you from getting a pair of these sweet duds it stretchs out a little as the day goes by but that is bearable it has a hint of pink to it too can be dressed up for the office or dressed down,1
11486,I debated between the xs and the smalland ended up with the small because its cotton i probably couldnt probably gotten the xs one we will see if it shrinks i hope it does a little i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine,1
11487,This tank top is comfortable and very cute it hides my tummy as well which is a bonus ordered in another color i love it so much,1
11488,Great with leggings and skinny jeans its comfortable too,1
11489,This looks great on the model but when it arrived i couldnt believe it was the same jacket it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it i really wanted to like it but even the xss was too baggy also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isnt actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry,0
11490,This is such a cute top i like it both off and on the shoulder easily tucked or left out depending how you want to style it,1
11491,I love this shirt i was surprised by the other reviews its boxy but not unflattering i get so many compliments on this a steal for the price,1
11492,This is a great sweater great color and style i love that its a little retro can be worn with jeans and tights highly recommend it does run a little big but not by a lot,1
11493,Absolutely love this top it is beautiful well made and so unique,1
11494,I agree with the other reviewers this shirt is cuter in person it is a flattering cut and the design is even prettier than in the photos the color is more navynot the charcoal color it looks in the photos the stitching is also more colorful in real life,1
11495,I decided to splurge i would not normally spend for a pair of jeans but when they went on sale i decided to go for it i am so glad that i did mother has a customer for life these jeans are the best by far i normally wear a size in most jeans but wear a in j brand and some others so i was a little nervous by previous reviewers not just on this website i decided to go with the since in mother brand this is actually a they fit great,1
11496,I ordered this online and took it back the day i got it i could not fit the neck hole over my head therefore i couldnt even see how it truly fit i had high hopes for this dress,0
11497,I love these shirts ordered in colors and they are great with leggings and skinny jeans and scarves so comfortable and on me a little long but not too long the fabric is fabulous and a great weight one of my favorites for sure,1
11498,The model in this photo should be standing tall because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper i ordered a small and am pounds the dress fits like a glove and is a pull over style the nude slip lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel yet nice breezy sexy appeal this dress can be worn to work on a hot date and even a nice weekend look when i say slimming i mean it the center detail grabs the most perf,1
11499,Love my new top i wear it casually with skinny navy pants and dressed up with new wide leg winter white pants its funky style garnered lots of compliments as a mother of two teens i love to dress cute and appropriate it really pairs well with so much and the bold flower makes it stand out,1
11500,Cute and super comfortableso its the best of both worlds it fits true to size but i bought a size up to add a little extra length love the soft blue color and ruffles,1
11501,These have been a staple for me the last three years i have owned three pairs of them in black i havent been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life please please bring them back,1
11502,I saw this online and immediately purchased the top in gray its so easy and casual but the shoulder detailing give it something different and unique for a regular gray shirt the fit is loose and comfortable but not overly big just right i cant wait to pair it with my new white jeans for summer,1
11503,I bought the grey which is a gorgeous color i like the long length in the arms though i tried it on in different colors and the arm length did very soft and pretty i like the length the back does wrinkle but i still like the shirt its loose casual and flattering,1
11504,Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous glad i didnt buy every color like i had planned to do,0
11505,Luckily i bought this on sale i now see the instructions online say to hand wash but i bought mine in the store the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size,0
11506,I decided to go shopping at my local co store and as soon as i walked in i saw this skirt but it was used as a top with green cropped summery pants on a mannequin one of the lovely salesgirls decided she liked it better that way after she tried it as a top herself i tried it as well and love it as a top she was small framed and my height and told me she sized up for comfort and she was correct if used with a strapless bra your regular size mine is a small will be uncomfortable howeve,1
11507,Im so disappointed the dress looked lovely in the box but when i started to unbutton it to try it on two buttons split in half its going right back,0
11508,This is tee is so soft and the other one in the same brand is the same love the details also and the color wash,1
11509,This is a such a cute top can be dressed up for work or worn more casually very flattering im and lb i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more tunicy bought two colors,1
11510,I found this skirt in a size at my local retailer store i admired it on the website but to see and feel it in person was very appealing i tried it on and it fit beautifully a style that looks great on my figure i love the mohair weave of the color block sections the negative is this skirt is really pricy but i had my birthday discount and since the size was sold out online and this skirt must have been a return the chances of it going on sale in a size were very slim i am still admirin,1
11511,I ordered two colors and was happy with them both i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer i like a layered look and having layers to peel as needed these tops are great on their own as well i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length really love the fabric too,1
11512,Im so thrilled with these the fabric is a little heavier and they just fit really well when similar styles tend to be baggy,1
11513,I found this cardigansweater in the sale room at retailer in navy thought i would just try it on the picture does not do this justice it is a basic piece but it is so soft and comfortable and when on it has a little bit of a whimsical swing to it i loved the way it kind of came to life i wear a ml and bought the m i have a d bust and it looked great it is a nice weight for springfall it is not a heavy sweater,1
11514,Love love these jeans they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect the color of the demin is great to wear to work the fit is great,1
11515,I love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight i have never had this problem before i ordered a petite and petite for reference i am tall and lbs the length is perfect and i really like the style if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite the petite sleeves were no looser sorry that this did not work for me,0
11516,I saw this on the rack and tried it on because it was just so beautiful the beading and embroidery details are unlike any piece of clothing ive seen in a readytowear store it feels and wears much more like a couture piecei wasnt planning on making such a big purchase but its just so beautiful i had to have it i doubt ill find another item of such quality and craftsmanship for the priceruns large im normally a size lbs and the size fit perfectly,1
11517,I love these jeansthe minute you put them on they feel broken in and comfortable they do have a long inseam and need to be worn with a stacked heel but that adds to the aesthetic i ordered my normal sizei usually wear a and could have kept thembut wanted a snugger fit through the bum so i gave them to a friend and ordered one size down and got the perfect fit for me,1
11518,This top is a keeper subtle plaid flowy fit so cute with skinny jeans and booties i would definitely recommend,1
11519,I tried this one with the free ship without much expectation so i was surprised by this nice piece i am not usually a fan of sheer shirts but this one manages to be sheer yet not see through the black color works that magic the linen makes this a nicer material rather than the usual knit i am not usually a linen fan as it gives me the itches but this is soft and light the back is really beautiful and brighter colors in person the balance between the front and back lengths does work a,1
11520,Love this top work appropriate and dress down worthy i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist comfortable fabric,1
11521,I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design i like it so much more than i expected to the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesnampampampampt stick out too much i love the green color too i tie the ties on the back of the dressat the level of my shoulder bladesrather than on top as in the photo i think it looks cuter that way so glad i took a chance on it,1
11522,I bought this unique beauty in a size the fit was superb and without compromise the ascetics are incomparable as well as the quality the most stunning dress i have purchased from retailer in quite a while,1
11523,Very cute great fit and super comfortable perfect for fall with tall boots,1
11524,I had high hopes for this top based on the photos but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it almost like a tie dye or slub effect not pretty at all,0
11525,These looked so fun i had to have them i usually wear a in pants but the large fit well despite a lack of thigh gap and walking in these all night i didnt lose a single sequin theyre comfortable and get a ton of compliments if youre considering them i definitely recommend going for it,1
11526,This is the most comfortable beautiful dresscover up i cant believe the sale price when i ordered my reg m was not available so i ordered a small it fits except the top button c i just called and got a m since there was one available today online hoping it ships so impressed with this ill wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath,1
11527,These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute they seem to run just a bit small i sized up one size from my usual and dont seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile,1
11528,Absolutely perfect and worth every penny i am and normally between a and in jackets while the small fit i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms insanely comfortable and truly stunning on expect compliments when you are wearing it,1
11529,I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and im so happy i did i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season i wore this with a black sleeve top dark skinny jeans and black bootiesperfect look for most seasons in dallas so happy about this purchase,1
11530,This tee is so soft and comfy it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual fits true to size and not too loose but not too clingy i know ill wear this one a lot,1
11531,Very nice top flattering and goes with everything i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement,1
11532,I sized down as other reviewers suggested usually an went down to and the dress fit finebut it was not attractive the cut was like a tent with an empire waist really just not attractive maybe it has to do with my body type but compared to the model this dress was so unflattering inperson returned,0
11533,I was intrigued by this vest online but really wanted to try it on first before i purchased it stopped into my local retailer store today and was happy to see they had it in stock i am typically a and purchased this in the ml this picture does not give the vest justice in terms of the way it falls which to me is what makes a vest a success or not also the colors are great i was wearing a cream sweater and black pants when i tried it on went great with those colors but i think it wi,1
11534,Made of casual materials perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top,1
11535,I usually wear a medium and this jacket was no exception the jacket is a shorter style as pictured it is still flattering even though it is a little boxy i got the grey which is a dark grayslight greige color if you like edgier over boho this is a cute transitional jacket,1
11536,The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line the top is navy and the lower arms are grey the sweater overall has more punch than pictured this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans it is a long sweater but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up i also really like that the front is not too flowy i am looking forward to wearing this all fall,1
11537,The patterscolors on this dress are much more stunning in person it is lined and feels very well made the pockets dont add bulk to the hip area as many times they do which is great the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves if you can try this one on in a store before buying for reference i am have broad shoulders am pear shaped i have hips and a good sized rear end b bust weigh lbs and generally wear a size or for tops and bottoms the size fit,1
11538,It sits a little short but works great for a jacket when you dont want to have a big winter coat when going out,1
11539,This chemise is very pretty in person when i tried it on i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise the material is kind of thin but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it it wont show it looked super cute with a denim jacket on i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly for reference i am b lbs i am very happy with this purchase and i cant wear it as a chemise a coverup or a hot day sundress highly recommended,1
11540,I just bought these jeans and i absolutely love them they are my new favorites i like them so much i am buying another pair i am short but always wear heels and these are perfect in every way slimming as well,1
11541,I love design of this top it will look beautiful on many body types the black material is thin and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms the top ran true to size for me,1
11542,I ordered this dress in a xs petite i am lbs the plaid looks more drab in person and the fit was very frumpy the wrap style is typically flattering but on this dress the dress tied above my natural waist and the fit made my hips appear larger i was pretty disappointed in this little number and will be sending it back it might work on taller people like the model but i would steer clear if you are a petite,0
11543,This tunic is a great length im and it hits me midlower thigh its so soft and flowy which i love i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that im almost months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby arm holes are big but a cami can fix that i got both colors available the ivory and light red,1
11544,I love this skirt the color is beautiful much darker than in the photo the only issue i have is with the length its much longer in real life im definitely going to need to have it shortened,1
11545,This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette i typically wear a p and ordered an xxsit fits perfectly it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath,1
11546,I noticed a xxs p at the store i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly i love it very stylish and flattering,1
11547,This is the most flattering shirtlove the fit and color,1
11548,Adorable top sweet but not too sweet can go either casual or dressy depending on what it is paired with i was looking for cropped tops as that silhouette works better for my proportions with the plethora of cropped bottoms that are in stores as another reviewer mentioned it is lined so no cami is necessary the label says dry clean only however i have washed it in a mesh bag on gentle in cold water and hung to dry without any issues the dry cleaning warning may be because of the lace on t,1
11549,This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the pastbeautiful embroidery great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything and light weight the top does run small so i needed the large size to accommodate my in bust plus a thin cami shirt is see through the large fit similarly to the fit on the model,1
11550,I saw this sweater online and have been looking for a unique sleevless sweater for some time now its a very beautiful sweater so i ordered it right away when i saw this design i recieved the sweater in the mail and really wanted to love it but it just wasnt for me its very well made and thick which i liked but i usually fit in small sized tops for retailer but they didnt have a small left in the sizes i ordered a medium and it still ran small i was very surprised its was also disappointing,0
11551,This blouse is wonderful i just got and wore the wine colored blouse today i received so many compliments i love it and with the sale price it is so worth it,1
11552,I have purchased many dresses from retailer for weddings and events this is the first time i have been disappointed with the quality however the sleeve on this dress ripped after lifting up my toddler son in the middle of a wedding the size seemed to fit perfectly but the fabric had no give it was not overly tight in the bust as i am bra size aa for the price i expected better the color and style of the dress is gorgeous so perhaps ordering one size up is the answer,0
11553,Great jeans im over its difficult finding jeans these fit like a glove with just enough stretch the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style i liked them so much i ordered another pair,1
11554,Very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers i ordered in my normal size medium neckline is cut a little low but not enough to change my mind on the purchase,1
11555,I took a chance and ordered this top on sale even after reading the troublesome reviews this updated take on the turtleneck is a keeper for me the purple color is vibrant and the collar lays without repeated fussing i ordered the xs for reference and the fit was tts and close to but not snug on my torso there is room for a button down blouse underneath as styled in a gallery pic and i did not find the sleeves to be problematic as it fit me close enough to the body to not giv,1
11556,This top flows so nice i get so many compliments when i wear it plus the color is an interesting blue,1
11557,Im currently on the prowl for the other colors of this fantastic sweater dresstunic i own the lavender in size m and it fits perfectly on me dd without enhancing what i want to hide great for winter,1
11558,I am so in love with this top can be worn on or off the shoulders the color is amazing,1
11559,I tried both the xss and the ml and found the larger size to be more roomy in the shoulders and just swish a bit better around the hips this is a change from many long vests my closet which tend to be size small or medium as are my blouses and tops however could happily live with either size and color gorgeous,1
11560,The picture says it all fits tts love it love it love it,1
11561,Well made embroidery held up well in the wash love the unique green color pattern comfortable got a size b,1
11562,These cords are beautiful in the wine color and fit very well i am and got the petite size and felt they were a little to short i know they are cropped flare but they hit me at a weird place hindsight i probable should have ordered then one size up,1
11563,This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted i had to size size down really nice,1
11564,I got this in an xs as the s sold out before i could purchase i can still zip it at but would be more comfortable at say im almost and with heels it skims the floor perfectly im so obsessed with the weight and texture it is full and fabulous ill just need to slim down a tad so i can be comfortable at my sisterinlaws wedding next month i wore a very fitted tank and it works perfectly photographs well and feels very red carpet worthy,1
11565,I dont care because i like be it so much but make no mistake it is not black but rather a dark navy however please dont let this fall negatively on your decision to buy it its fabulous,1
11566,I love this dress because its so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i dont generally wear plus its a three season dress with pockets bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small on top im a ml girl and the medium is huge im not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now this dress looks good with or without a belt with long boots booties and sandals so happy with this purchase,1
11567,Beautiful in person highly recommend great quality beautiful design flattering,1
11568,I saw this skirt at my local retailer store and thought it was just another corduroy skirt until i got up close and personal it feels so soft yet there is structure to the skirt hurray for a bit of spandex for movement the first button is different from the rest of the buttons and i appreciate that type of details only the wine color was available in the store and it is shown just like on the photo the skirt falls right above my knees and size regular fit me very well im waist,1
11569,This skirt is adorable and has a beautiful pattern its also extremely comfortable a total steal at the sale price,1
11570,This dress was a disappointment not black but brown and it was very oddly made with a weird seam right across the belly on its way back,0
11571,I consider myself fairly busty d but i didnt have any problems wearing my normal size smallmediumi actually went with the small the lace inset doesnt give but it wasnt tight at all i love the flow of the blouseit is going to be a great transitional piece into fall,1
11572,Lovely silky top poly i typically look better in more cool tones this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off it really has three very pretty complimentary patterned fabrics the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra,1
11573,I tried these in store didnt have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me small waist and athletic fuller legs but surprisingly these work great they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend i do think they run a little small i am almost always a but i took these in a they didnt have a in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight highly recommend,1
11574,This is casual and comfortablealong with soft touch of its textile i also like the pastel color of flower prints especially i love the purple flower print with grey background which is sold out alreadyit also fits well with my body and makes look cool it is perfect for everyday use,1
11575,This dress is so pretty can be worn casually or with heels to dress up i get so many compliments on it and its so comfortable its like wearing pajamas i highly reccomend it,1
11576,Bought this for a summer wedding it fit great and i got a lot of compliments,1
11577,In the online picture this lightweight sweatshirt looked so inviting that i decided to order it when it arrived i could not believe how soft and comfortable it felt it was equally comfortable on the rayon tencel and cotton content of the fabric created such a comfy feel that this top is sure to be a favorite for a relaxing weekend or evening i ordered the size even though i usually order a small in most tops this one seems to lend itself to the oversized look and i was right about t,1
11578,Unfortunately this sweater let me down i love retailer especially their sweaters but this one fell flat it was tight on the arms and didnt hang well on my body it was odd in length and added about lb to my frame i kept it because i wanted to force it to work alas i just donated it hopefully it fits someone else better than me,0
11579,I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large im and ordered xss and i have return due to size,0
11580,Was looking for a cute off the shoulder top and this is a fun one can be worn both on or off the shoulders nice length and the pink is a beautiful raspberry color love the linen blend too im a size and i ordered the xs flows away from body its a bit big but i like the style,1
11581,My new favorite cozy and stylish goto piece for everything from park with the kiddos to mat class to impromptu financial meetings,1
11582,Just got this in the mail today very pretty soft and comfortable i could probably have sized down but it fits fine for reference im lbs and i got an xs grab this while its on sale,1
11583,This is a fantastic maxi it is very flattering you can wear a normal bra with it for me very necessary and the added ruffle makes it perfect its a casual fabric but because of the contrast in fabric can be dressed up easily i am foot and curvy on top and ordered a small petite in many antrho maxis i go down to an xs but in this one the small felt the best more comfortable around the waist will get tons of wear out of this have already taken it on a trip and wo,1
11584,This top is really pretty and nice quality runs big i went down a size and its perfect coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo,1
11585,After a few months of coveting i received this jumpsuit as a gift apparently my longing wasnt too subtle and was delighted to find it didnt disappoint at all the material has a nice weight and falls away from the body but still is very swingy and light it is great for our slightly chilly spring yet i expect it will be fantastic as the weather warms up i am and usually a or size in bottoms and an xs or s on top i got this jumpsuit in an xs and it fits very loosely much lik,1
11586,I wanted to love this dressand it did not disappoint true to size not too snug but doesnt make you look shapeless the material is soft and has great movement looks great with boots and booties i know i will be wearing this one often,1
11587,Great jacket for a cool morning not too heavy and i found it to run true to size nice little details,1
11588,I love this top it comes with its own camisole the embroidery is lovely and the fit is perfect,1
11589,This dress is incredible soft and flattering it sits higher on the waist than most other dresses ive received from retailer which is actually great for me as i have a short torso i have been able to put it in with the regular wash cycle which was a pleasant surprise the only issue was with the overlapping fabric on the top i ended up adding an extra stitch to avoid being totally exposed,1
11590,I bought this in the sable green you can wear this blouse tucked in or out if youre wearing something lie leggings it is comfortable and the color is very flattering,1
11591,This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time i ordered it with the layered luna dress in grey and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo very chic i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come for reference i ordered my normal size xs lbs muscular and did not find it to be too tight in the arms and i have fairly broad shoulders i did not try it on with long sleeves but i still think there would be adequate room,1
11592,I saw this and tried to wait for it to go on sale but it sold so fast i wanted the black and i check everyday until they had my size i love this coat main because of the wait it goes around the neck since i am not a scarf person this is very cute im glad i got it even at the full price,1
11593,I love the design of this sweatershorter length with shorter sleevesgoes great with jeans and has a very different look,1
11594,Love this blouse the color is really unique and love the back button detail i dont think the white buttons look cheap at all as another person pointed out they add a lot to an already beautiful top cant wait to wear it,1
11595,I tried this on at the store and i agree with the other reviewwers on the sizing instead of purchasing my usual size i bought the size as it was indeed a bit tight in the chest for my d chest but it was no biggie as they had my size i love all the embroidery and lace the length color and detail on this one its also soft and made from cotton so it will be just perfect for summertime and will look adorable with tights and boots and a cardi or jean jacket in the fall,1
11596,Comfortable coolperfect summer tank ordered one for my daughtersmall had to get myself one toomediumboth tts great for errand runs around house lounging sleeping seems better made than more expensive tops ordered as of late good job retailer,1
11597,I love these tees i ordered of the map shirt they are comfortable and stylish i knew that i would wear it so much so i bought a spare,1
11598,I absolutely love this topthe color style fiteverything i took another reviewers advice and sized down from my normal large to a medium i have had so many compliments wearing this top it is very feminine flows nicely hangs well love the color cant recommend this enough,1
11599,I love this dress easy breezy flowy comfortable pink fits a true medium would recommend to anyone makes me a little flirty,1
11600,I just received these jeans love them i usually wear a i ordered a and they fit great they are too long will need to be hemmed but the fit is great the material is soft lovely great buy,1
11601,I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing i am usually a medium sometimes small in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small i could barely get it over my head i then ordered the medium and large i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly like the model shot so i would say this definitely runs small i never wear a large for reference i am c broad shoulder the gold beading on the top is very pretty and the gold embroidery thread really pops t,1
11602,I was expecting not to fit into this because im womanly and generally wear a size in things but the picture was so gorgeous i had to try im so happy i did it slipped right on and is flowy yet not overly so it still has shape the colors are exactly as it is portrayed on the site i love having this in my closet,1
11603,I loved this top when i first saw it i tried on my usual size l and there is no stretch through the bust so it totally flattened my chest a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xls that must have been returned i tried them on and they fit perfectly i suggest sizing up if you have a chest this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap skinny jeans and boots,1
11604,Not just another striped tee perfect drape lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body is super flattering the subtle shimmer is just right love the gray very versatile irresistible im a size small this is tts,1
11605,This is my new favorite dress while elegant it isnt too fancy for a nice office environment very comfortable and a perfect size fit i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee not below since i am but not a big deal everyone has complimented this dress,1
11606,I love the cut and fit of this t its soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering the gray floral print is very pretty its perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer,1
11607,Love my mother jeans and these are super cute for spring they fit tts im and i bought my normal,1
11608,The most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when youre is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off not so with the petite inseam on these love the perfect amount of stretch the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect definitely recommend,1
11609,This dress is a keeper fits true to size comfortable and love the pockets it can be a casual day dress or add some jewelry for a night time dinner out i was concerned with the fabric being a velvet material but is very light and comfortable,1
11610,I love these pants saw them instore couldnt do it at full price but theyre a steal on sale super soft comfy love the wide leg fits true to size im lbs ordered the xs bc no petite waistband fits a bit tight but i prefer that to them slipping down would buy again,1
11611,Great fit and style i got the navy and the color is beautiful,1
11612,I tried this on in the store but almost didnt because i thought it would look like a sack the dress looks so good it fits nicely in the shoulders which gives structure and then the rest of the dress is roomy but no so much it looks stupid im and it hit above my knees by an inch or two,1
11613,Like others i finally received my size p black pants after months of waiting for starters these pants run small so i ordered a size up but still in petite because i adored the red ones i got this past summer when the black pants arrived they were a full three inches shorter than the red ones which were also p and the fabric did not feel anywhere close to the same quality im debating ordering the regular length but im not sure ill bother based on some of the other reviews,0
11614,I went with my instincts and grabbed a size l as opposed to my usual medium fits great and flatters the girls while hiding my meaty back such a great artistic design i will love wearing it this weekend i am scared to wash it i may just have to dip it in lingerie powder and drip dry for fit reference dd i hold my weight in my neck shoulders back upper arms tummy im not a gorilla,1
11615,I did not intend on buying this dress as i had taken two others that i had seen online into the dressing room i actually saw the black version of this dress first and was a bit disappointed that it wasnt available in my size so i thought i would try this on just for size i was totally shocked as to how cute it looked on i had taken both the xs and the s into the dressing room the xs was very tight fitting in the arms and chest i am very small busted and normally wear a xs in tops and,1
11616,These are very cute but very very stiff have washed x and still not relaxing not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear my waist is smaller and generally have gap in waist to get fit right in hips super cute with sandals mules duck boots,1
11617,Big bust smallish waist this top is so cute and flattering absolutely love it,1
11618,I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric its light soft and crisp which is perfect for summer days the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso the waste line is a bit high for me but overall it didnt feel weird or look funny there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with once i tried it on i had to bring it home with me,1
11619,This sweater is so soft beautiful and well made it runs just a bit large but i love the look,1
11620,The top on the model in the photo is a true ivory but the top in reality is more beige well im blonde with fair skin so im not sure this is going to work it also looks more dressy in the photo than it does in reality i think the ivory color on the model and the pleats only down the front make it look more dressy but in reality with it really being beige having pleats everywhere and being a crinkly fabric it looks more casual i had wanted it to be more dressy to pair with skirts,0
11621,Just bought this top today at our local store its just gorgeous on im a dd and bought the size small and it fits perfectly if youre small chested you can probably size down as it runs nice and full for a larger bust its so feminine and pretty on a must for any wardrobe,1
11622,I was really intrigued by this swimsuit when i saw it online but i wasnt sure how it would look on me but the reviews convinced me i should get it and figured if i didnt like it i could just return it i love this suit the color is beautiful and the high neckline is offset by the open back for anyone who has a large chest which i do g this is one of the most securesupportive swimsuit i have ever tried on do not hesitate to buy this suit though i would go a size up if you have a lar,1
11623,Ig and the first reviewer convinced me to buy this top it was styled so beautifully with jeans and shorts on two different retailer associates i wanted to see if i could pull it off too unfortunately my body type and shortness makes the it look like im wearing short peasant skirt as a top really disappointed since the top is soft beautiful vibrant silk maybe i will keep since im losing weight and will try it on again generally i wear size ml and im purchased this c,1
11624,I ordered this dress on a whim in my normal size and if fits perfectly i felt so pretty when i put it on i love the volume of the skirt with the tighter top it was very flattering to me the linen thickness was nice but not for summer in florida maybe spring but its lovely,1
11625,I can not imagine the cut in the waist being flattering on anyone i ordered an xs and an xxs still would have flared too much in the waste i ignored the previous review and that was a huge mistake,0
11626,Im really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii its a great color soft flowy fun practical,1
11627,I saw these on the freshly cut promo discount decided to order my usual size reg in pilcro a great fit appreciate the midrise not too snug or baggy look pretty much on me as in the model pic except they fall abt below my ankles i am only so not a surprise they are a little longer on me but its really ok fyi the front button back pocket tacks are gold which gives a classy look to these jeans just love love the price too,1
11628,Very lovely print and fabric there is more gray to the prints background than the photo shows the shape is feminine and flattering although the sleeves are more fitted on my arms i bought this to wear to an early fall rehearsal dinner very happy with the purchase,1
11629,Hi when i received this top i tried it on looked in the mirror and packed it up for a return the quality is excellent but it just too boxy fits nothing like it appears on the model,0
11630,I found this top really flattering on i originally ordered a and found it a little too big the fit perfectly it falls around your belly button area so a little of your stomach will show it has a flattering scoop neckline and the ruffles give it that extra flare very light weight for the summer colors are brighterbetter in person,1
11631,There is so much going on on this dress its fantastic hard to tell from pics but there is a peekaboo lattice detail going down the front and back of the sleeves the beading is plentiful but not too much for work dress is significantly longer on me than the model im but still a tad above the knee with tall boots or booties and tights this will go straight from work to out for the evening im real long waisted originally ordered m but exchanged for l much better fit overa,1
11632,The top of this suit was not proportioned well i am normally a c so with swimsuits i vary between a small or a medium the cup size on this was very small for a medium the band to hook in the back was almost too big there was no way to adjust the band in the back and the cups were clearly too small for a c cup the print was darling but unfortunately this will have to go back,0
11633,I tell everyone i know to try these jeans that they are so worth the price tag ive been an ag super fan for years but i fell in love with paige the moment i tried these on i still love ag for their colored and patterned ankle denim and cords i have worn these over times without ever having to wash them i never understood the idea that youre not supposed to wash denim but now i realize that its feasible they dont stretch out and still hug me like a second skin without feeling,1
11634,Thylo strikes again this dress was magic the second i put it on flowy polkadot magic this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening with plenty of customizable options in between to dress down it looks great with a denim jacket then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun you can pair it with tall boots or short sandals pumps you name it the ties at the neck look great undone loosely tied or done in a bow leggings or ti,1
11635,The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off whiteoatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning,0
11636,Such a cute top does run slightly big depending on how loose you want it to be for such a simple design the quality is great,1
11637,Overall very pretty,1
11638,Im a big fan of level jeans and linen pants these are great good quality flattering fit lovely color i got the coral in size petite and that works for me they do start out just a bit snug in the seat when i first put them on but theyll pretty quickly stretch out just enough to maintain shape without becoming baggy like my other level linens something to keep in mind when trying to find your right fit i was a little worried that the drawstring meant there wouldnt be much,1
11639,Wonderful colors and fit tts love the style can were on or off the shoulders love it,1
11640,Im size top and the xl is a little big but it is a longer tshirt whihc i love thank you sooo much please return the size large back,1
11641,This is a very nice jumpsuit reviewers were correct stating that torso is long fit better a taller person as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size im ft tall lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso this one however turned out to be perfect true to size and fit not only that the fabric is very soft and good quality very interesting style of the jumpsuit looks much better in person i particularly liked cropped widel,1
11642,Love love love im lbs b and have an athletic frame fairly narrow hips and i bought an xs in red usually i am a s with retailer for dresses although occasionally a m for slimmer dresses but i found that the top part of this dress required me to size down to an xs as the low backdesign of the dress fit too loosely with the size sit hung so that it showed my bra straps and the sleeves were a tad baggy under the arms showing about of bra underneath my guess is that if y,1
11643,This is a cutesomewhat dressy top it has a bit of a sheen ties on the sides and a zipper down the back itll go great with pants or skirts the fit though is huge im normally an but i got this in a machinewashable even though it says dry clean if it doesnt say dry clean only you can wash it,1
11644,Love this shirt i am and have a slender torso and the small fits perfectly i love that its long so you can wear it as a single shirt or use it as an extra layer i also have a grey druzy necklace to dress this puppy up purchased it in black and this will be a new staple,1
11645,I agree that this shirt is boxy and has no shape it doesnt look at all like it does on the model i returned it,0

11653,I love hd paris styles this jumpsuit appealed to me online so i ordered a p i am usually a or in regular sizes at retailer i decided the regular size may be too long too much fabric for me i am c it was easy to slip into it zip up the back tie the black ribbon in the back it doesnt say in the details that it has a builtin bra which is a good feature the bra cups are a little small on me but not a dealbreaker the length is fine falling just above my ankles i j,1
11654,Twirly full skirtme lbs a tried and pictured the size a perfect fit with a bit of give in the bust for a larger cup sizeim not particularly curvy and i felt this added a waistline to me i think this is an almost universally flattering cutmaterial was soft and an easy wearsimple enough that i think it will wear for quite a few years,1

11656,I love this dress its so comfy and flowy i wore to an event and got many compliments on the color and design of the dress im and weigh,1
11657,I love ag stevie jeans but these are my favorite super soft with just the right amount of stretch they keep their fit and dont stretch out the very dark wash makes them extremely flattering im petite and a bit curvy and these are extremely comfortable,1
11658,Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not not flattering ankle opening is too small and they have a funny smell,0
11659,This fell apart after wearing it once for the price it should hold up better its too delicate,0
11660,First im an and tried the s and m i couldve worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion i kept the small the color i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark the only con the sleeves they stick right out to the sides and dont lay down as much as the online photo it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it material is super light,1
11661,I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like iti had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red as well however this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and horrors an elastic waistband this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result back it went,0
11662,Sadly i had to keep only a few dresses not all of them so that one is in my wish list if my xs petite goes on sale in red and blue i am pal so that is hte better color for me i have not seen the green in eprson but the neutral color is very nice too if you are not into redmaterila thinish strecthy super comfortable may be cool in a cold area though brrfit xs petite fit perfectly everywhere surprisingly the shoulders are capped sleeves i dindt exepct having them fall,1

11664,Effortless and super cute im currently wearing my blue tunic for the first time with black leggings and booties i absolutely love the everyday comfort of this piece a few have mentioned length as being an issue im wearing a regular s my normal size at and find the length similar to the models the cut on this is perfect i was worried that it would look like a plaid sack on but its a slim cut that looks polished without needing to be belted this will surely be a goto for me,1
11665,This is a unique take on a denim shirt i have about five other denim shirts but love this style,1
11666,Ok so first things first im g and i took a small in this its your typical clothstone fabric and feel sooo goodi do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online it doesnt look that oversized i can see where taller ladies wont go for the shortness but at thats just not an issue for me the bottom is very flattering and doesnt do that long grandma butt that some rompers,1
11667,Really great pair of pantsleggings considering a second pair great flattering fit i ordered the petite as well because i was concerned about the length but the stride on the petite a was to short and the regular was not too long after all,1
11668,I loved the way this shirt looked when i tried it on in the store buto when i got home i realized its extremely sheer you cant wear a white bra with it for example because it will show through taking it back,0
11669,The dress is very pretty but the sequins are dark blue i imagined they would be silvergold given the photo but the dress is essentially light pink and blue,0
11670,Delighted with these made in the usa was a big selling factor great quality and fit will look out for more active wear from this brand,1
11671,Great dress love how flattering it is and that it has a little bit of a retro feel the dress is well made too,1
11672,This top is absolutely stunning i purchased the white one just received and it fits nicelya little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way this will look great with everything it is well constructed and looks very unique love it,1
11673,Material is hard to wear a bra under it,0
11674,These shirts are perfect for a casual day basically tla shirts are my daily go to i usually wear a small but i buy these in medium because i like the looser fit a little pricey so after buying at full price i waited until they were on sale to buy more,1
11675,This is one of those very retailer tops that you cant find anywhere else the feel is folkloric but the country is not specific although listed as a tee the material is a knit with heft and is lined from the bust seam down the embroidery is combined with cutwork to give it a highend finish and justify the price this is a dressup tee for sure i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt i wear either a or in mos,1
11676,I saw this online and liked it but then tried it on in a store a few weeks later and the pictures truly do not do this gem of a dress justice the fit is flowy but tts as the cotton lining underneath fits closer to the body its an incredibly comfortable and easy piece to wear the first day i wore this i received so many compliments the colors are vibrant and its really just a unique piece with beautiful detailing from the embroidery on the top of the dress to the beads on the ties on the,1
11677,I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but its going back because the fabric is coated it does not drape or hang nicely at all i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible im usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me,0
11678,I love this tee it is comfortable and soft with the nice detail of buttons at the shoulders a good vneck and subtle stripes however it runs quite long i thought i ordered the petite but i received a regular length tee and it was down to my thighs so order a petite unless you are quite tall or like a tee to fall that low over your hip area,1
11679,Love this blouse it fits well with a slight flare at the bottom doesnt wrinkle much and washes in cold water perfectly have had compliments on the style and design a definite buy,1
11680,I ordered this dress in both colors the peach color is so beautiful in person im planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer if i can hold off until then definitely worth the price,1
11681,Great tank to wear to work or a night out fits true to size,1

11683,This top is great it hangs in the perfect way to hide imperfections the orangered is a great accent and i received compliments when i wore it,1
11684,The sweater is a great fit and the styling is very original and wonderful it will be great with leggings jeans or even a straight skirt i would definitely recommend this sweater,1
11685,I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sackthe model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline,0
11686,Great sweater looks and fits as shown if youre between sizes size down as the shoulders are relatively broad,1
11687,The color is darker than shown i ordered the denim looking one the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color it must be great for the tall skinny model but if your and pear shaped like me its a no go took it back to my local store,0
11688,Love this skirt purchased it in a and it fit fairly good sat high up on the waist which i like however now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a i think the would have let it sit further down making it not so short i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up is my typical size in full skirts,1
11689,I picked this up on sale and was glad i did the material is just the right thickness for some of the chilly days we have here in spring in the northeast the fit is right on but size up if you are unsure or inbetween the detail down the back is adorable and adds a point of interest to this sweatshirt the fit is boxy but i think it compliments and balances the overall girly design,1
11690,I wanted to love this dress i saw it in the catalog in blue and wanted it however for some reason i took my sweet time in ordering it and by the time i did only the orange was available but on sale i was so excited when it arrived and as i was trying it on i thought this is a bit shorter in the skirt than i usually go but its so pretty and then i couldnt get my right arm in the sleeve at all i wondered if i had caught some of the lining as i was putting it on or something but n,0

11695,Im i ordered the petite nice to have this option the lengthvolume doesnt overwhelm me as some kimonos do this feels more like a fallseason kimono due to the fabric content it is not a wispy fabric theres weight and some stiffness to the drape you can see on the model how the fabric stands away from her body its a different look from silky feeling kimonos that hug the body a rich blend of blue black white subtle tan maybe some silver grey hard to tell the colors look li,1
11696,Finally a dress that is not too short im and ordered two sizes the small was too short and a little snug for my liking but the medium was a perfect fit,1

11698,At years old i still like fun hip fashionable items but i dont want to look like i raided my year old daughters closet this jacket hits the mark perfectly it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape ill be wearing this often,1
11699,I agree with one of the reviewers that the armholes on this dress are big however the garment is tight around my chest area even though i am not chesty and lays next to my body perfectly so this is not problematic i dont feel like they are gaping holes there is just more area there than i would be used to i like the fabric this is made out of it is not quite as soft as i had hoped but it is comfortable i would say it is a medium weighta little more than i was expecting the flare is,1
11700,This tee is amazing it is so soft and comfortable and is great for those of us who are tall it has great length i went with a medium because i didnt want it too tight i really hope that retailer restocks soon because i want to buy one in every color,1

11707,I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous i actually ordered sizes p and p depending on some cuts im between those sizes i am lbs but with holidays eating i have gained pounds so far so the p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derrirethe dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor,1
11708,I have a closet filled with black lace dresses but this one is my new favoritethe style is classic with an unexpected yet still elegant twisti ordered my usual size and found it to run a little on the small side especially in the waistthis is one dress you need to have in your closetif you are in between sizes i would suggest going up one size,1
11709,I bought this top as it is perfect for work under a blazer the patten is pretty and eye catching i love that its silk and has the tie in front so its not too low for work so chic and sophisticated,1
11710,I think im on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit because i love this dress it may be because i dont have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesnt cling i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little i do have to wear a cami,1
11711,I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that itd work out based on all of the good reviews when i got it i was happy with the fit and fabric but i was stumped as to what id wear it with it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didnt know if i could pull off the length i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath its so stretchy warm and cozy the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k,1

11721,This dress is so much better in person i would say it is tts but it was oddly baggy around the chestarmpit area which didnt deter me from keeping it the biggest negative i have is that it is rayon but i dont think thatll change with retailers anytime soon,1

11724,I received this dress in the mail yesterday right away i noticed the coloring wasnt quite the same as it appears in the images online in person the hints of brown appear more bronzy and shiny as opposed to more muted i was willing to look past that but then i tried it on i ordered a small which is my typical size in retailer dresses it ran quite large and was way to long for me i am overall between the coloring and sizing this dress wasnt a hit for me,0

11751,I ordered this top in a size m as i heard mara hoffman runs small the size chart on her site would have me order a size s as i have a bust however my bra size is a d or c and the size m is what fit therefore a m might also fit a b and a a as the back is adjustable it even stays up without the halter which is highly unusual for methe only negative that really disappointed me is that the patterns are not quite symmetrical as i expect from this brand and from t,1

11762,I love these shorts the subtle floral pattern is even prettier in person the drawstring waist allows me to customize the fit for my newly pregnant belly,1
11763,I absolutely love this jacket it is the softest jacket i own the collar takes this to the next level i wasnt sure i would like the collar but after trying it on i love it im so confused as to why the pockets are partially sewn together its weird but according to the other reviews i am hoping to open the pockets up completely i really should have gotten a medium in this coat i am usually between a small and medium and this is a little on the smaller side i bought this one on sale so,1
11764,Love this sweater great for work very soft and comfortable color is gorgeous,1
11765,Love this dress very soft and easy to wear im and it hits the top of my knees which is perfect for me cant wait to wear it with white leggings and boots this winter ive seen several similar styles and tried on a few at other boutiques but they were thick material and bulky denim this is the perfect light and soft to the touch highly recommend,1
11766,Very cute top i ordered the white it is thin so you might want to wear a cami with it will look very cute with jeans shorts or skirts love the back wish it came in more colors would definitely order it in black,1
11767,This tunic is so stylish and pretty the fit is close but not clingy lbs size xs and the rear coverage is just right to wear with skinny jeans or leggings the fit is flattering whether the zippers are up or down without riding up around the waist the cowled collar falls around the neck evenly without the bulky look that similar styles can sometimes lend the moss color is pretty the fabric is soft and warm yet still fairly lightweight if the pockets are properly tucked and layi,1
11768,I was really drawn to this burgundy color on this sweater but wasnt all that impressed with the style as soon i tried it on wow it is very flattering the color is gorgeous i can see myself using it with jeans pencil skirts pants for reference it does run large i am usually a x large but i got a large and fits beautifully,1
11769,I really didnt expect this sweater to be so short im and there is no way it would fit me properly i honestly didnt even try it on i pulled it out of the bag and put it right back in and returned it it looks like a crop top i bought the blue which was not as rich and nice looking in person as the picture i love most things i buy through retailer but this was a swing and a miss,0
11770,Maeve is one of my favorite retailer designers usually fall in love with a blouse only to look at the tag and discover its by maeve go figurethis top is just atrocious though does nothing for girls with a larger chest very boxy and unflattering gorgeous colors though and the sleeve concept is cute however where the sleeve meets the shirt looks cheap and thrown on not impressed,0
11771,Ordered this in my typical size xs and it fits perfectly the weather hasnt cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear plus there is enough room for me to wear a teeshirt or thin blouse underneath ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral brown that should go with almost anything,1
11772,First of all the photo online doesnt really do the colors of this skirt justice it is a heathered knit with colors of white gold deep yellow raspberry or almost maroon and teal i have never seen a color combo like this before and its really fun i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned or even navy or tan the skirt has a lining in it and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an,1

11775,Pilcro jeans used to be my favorite in the past months or so i have bought new pairs and all have been so disappointing first of all the quality is horrible now in the past they would last for years and hold up great my last pair of stet jeans started to visibly wear out within a month also pilcro jeans now stink in the most disgusting toxic way they smell horrible despite washing what happened pilcro,0

11779,This is one fabulouslooking dress however the really scratchy neckline at the lace edge was a dealbreaker for me i even tried sizing up to see if that would help but it was still too scratchy for me,0
11780,Love this dress the neckline is gorgeous,1
11781,I just bought this dress as it went on sale recently i read all the other reviews and imho the dress is ivory not yellow as another reviewer suggested i am only and weigh llbs there were no petite sizes available so i bought a size which is a bit long but thats ok the arm holes werent too small and the neckline is large enough to slip over my head the dress is very much a swing dressi wish there was just a little less dressit really is too voluminous for my taste i,1
11782,Outstanding dress looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come i couldnt decide which color way i liked in this dressthe redwhite or the green so i purchased both i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtimesummer dress yes the cut runs small but i dont think it is as small as some of the other reviews i typically wear i size and this one the fit perfectly so maybe one size up,1

11788,I adore this dress as a mom of two under i need things that are cute but nofuss this is exactly that piece beautifully lined breezy linen fabric machinewashable and flattering the catch is finding the right size to flatter im and found my normal size small to be really big everywhere i went with the xs to avoid issues in the shoulders but i maybe could have gone even smaller fabric doesnt have a lot of give so if you are large in the chest my guess would be a possi,1
11789,I purchased this shirt to wear postpartum so i could easily be comfortable but still cute it will work well for the fall with some cute jeans and booties i cannot wait to wear itany day now great choice,1
11790,I ordered this in white and its quite sheer as others have noted it is really full and it hits at midhip which doesnt work on my figure if it had been a few inches longer and more of a tunic or less voluminous it could have worked but nope,0
11791,Comfort is very important to me as someone who is not a skinny girl slimming clothing is important to me this top is very pretty comfortable and can be dressed up or down it does require dry cleaning which might be a con for some people,1
11792,Love this sweater the abstract floral design adds an understated romantic touch the red is a beautiful rich red and the cotton is super soft and comfy ive tried it on with pencil skirts and jeans and it looks great with both im considering buying it in the off white too but it does have some cons one is the waist band hits me where it does on the model and if you look closely you can see where the sweater poof out over the band a bitit does that on me too unless i turn the band up t,1
11793,This dress is stunning the cut the color mine is a dark green not purple as pictured and the material are all super unique and gorgeous i first tried on a medium but it was a little too large the small fit perfectly and still has the loose romantic look intended i cant wait to wear this piece with a suede moto jacket or even denim for a casual funky look love,1
11794,I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it in store i tried it on immediately and knew i had to have it it fits a little big definitely size down but other than that i have never felt more beautiful than when i wear this the color is a perfect blush pink and the drop waisttiered skirt make you feel downright bridal when wearing it despite it being the perfect fabric for day i find that this dress is perfect for those days at work when i have an event later it can be dre,1
11795,Im not sure why this skirt is described online as having a blue motif the background is black and the blue in the pattern could pass as grey the material is a strong polyester which should be nice and easy to clean but it almost feels like silk i love the aline and even with the ruffles it looks very slimming on this pearshaped gal i can see wearing it with strappy sandals and a light blouse in the next few weeks but pairing it with a sweater and boots well into the fall and winter i thin,1
11796,Flattering cut the tie neck is very nice but definitely needed the petite for me regualr size went too low the striping is a nice flowey thin fabric in grey and navy with a bit of texture in ti not sure it is obvious from the picture length in eptite went right below my knee but in a goood spot overall loved it but returned in hopes it hits sales one day jsut spending too much latetly,1

11798,Got this in the gold and its so much better than i imagined runs longer on my frame than on model but i love this extra long look with white fitted pants and heels total classic easy elegance and comfortable too,1
11799,I bought this for an event and when it arrived i realized it was probably too dressy for my event there are some large sparkly clusters of stones that are beautiful but do make the dress more cocktail attire than i needed if i had something to wear it to i would keep it in a heartbeat the fit is flattering and the quality is reminiscent of old school retailer pieces there are cups already in the bodice which is a huge plus imo its unique and beautiful,1
11800,I was on the fence about this dress but so glad i did thanks to the reviews i sized down from my normal medium to a small and this dress is definitely one of my favs it is a quality comfortable material that does stretch and allows you movement with ease the illusion slims me in the middle where i need it most i adore this dress,1

11806,Super comfortable great with jeans or leggings i would definitely order a size down,1
11807,Although the weather is getting warm in ca the gold color and cut of this shirt made me want to buy just one more long sleeved itemand it didnt disappoint im actually looking forward to next winter so i can wear it again,1
11808,I got this coat to throw over slacks at work with the ac and its perfect the picture online is less flattering than in person found that the medium was too large in shoulders and arm length small was right for lb typical size,1
11809,Gorgeous wide leg sweats i did wear them outside but i wore with a long t because they are slightly see through if they are snug on your bum they dont seem like they will last long because they are thin but the cut is adorable and very flattering they were a gift not sure i would have spent but i do love them,1
11810,This is a great maxi dress for people that want a classic fit but nothing tight it is figure flattering yet modest enough to wear to work i am and a half and many maxis are so long that i must wear heels this one is perfect length for me and can be worn with flats or heels,1
11811,These tights are wonderful exactly as pictured but the shimmer is more apparent in person definitely true to size and super comfy the only tricky part is finding the right shoes to pair with,1
11812,I was hesitant to order high rise pants seems they only ever look good on a tall person but these worked out perfect im barely and the pants are just as long on me as the model in the picture just barely brushing the floor when im in heels though if im honest they do touch down a bit which will scuff them most likely but to tailor inch seems ridic love them super sexy slimming and elegant the color is rich and the material is not too thick or thin very comfortable stretc,1
11813,Its thin very but i were a cute scrappy athletic type bra underneath and its so cuteits a stink top i pick a spot to tuck in around the from and let the rest flowaside from being a swing top it runs large i have in xs and im a dd and i still have roomi have it in faded redpink and white and am buying blue too love it,1
11814,I purchased this top i thought of it as a sweater to wear for a chilly holiday in mn its super flattering and i think it would be on anyone my year old daughter saw it on me and claimed at a christmas present so i just ordered another we have very different body types but the neckline made us both look very elegant and it is super comfortable i havent seen how it cleans yet we both got the lighter colored onelove,1
11815,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality cut and softness of this dress it can be dressed up or down with or without leggingstights and is cute with boots or flats my only complaint is that the sleeves are not near as long as what is shown in the photo id say more like sleeves thankfully there is elastic at the cuffs so the sleeves can be pushed up and the the material can slightly drape over the elastic,1
11816,This dress is fabulous with attention to most details lbs the fits perfectly overall fit is excellent sleek but not form fitting so very appropriate for work length is also great another plusfor work many times the dresses are just a tad short but this is great arm holes are also great not overly long as they often are very nicely lined substantial fabric the only lack of attention to detail is they did not include the bra strap holders why cant more dresses be made t,1
11817,I have one in every color that is how much i love them i love that they zip on the side and are high waited i am and got a and they hit me just right,1
11818,Girls this dress is gorgeous but if you are an ab cup there is just too much fabric in the bust the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number alas i had to send it back and was very sad to do so,1
11819,Beautiful color and a great lightweight piece for fall layering the petite sizing was perfect for me more like a belted kimono very happy with this purchase,1
11820,athletic c as info got my usual m and this is everything the previous reviewers have said the sleeves run long a bit bunchy at the wrists cuffing makes them look normal length maybe it could be just the one ive received i know its a tie waist but when i move it opens as if the body is a tad small it does fit like the photo but opens with ordinary movement pull it tighter doubleknot it you say it only reinforced my belief that i needed to size up i reordered in a,1
11821,I ordered this coat as it was on sale but it was so nice it would have been worth full price i am feet and pounds i ordered a petite as i like jackets a little larger for a sweater underneath but i could have used the petite as well this coat is heavy so also very warm it is a little shorter than on the model the colors are more vivid the blue is a denim wash blue not navy blue it fits fabulously and the quality is great i wore it to dinner with a navy turtleneck and must,1

11823,Lovely dress fits great very flattering flirty loved it so much ordered another one in a different color cant wait for warm weather so i can wear these dresses,1
11824,I gulped when i put this in my bag during retailer days because the price was still too much but thought this has to be wonderful to charge so much right boy was i wrong this is a sweater knit with a very deep vneck thats incredibly boxy and unattractive the knit shed all over my pants in the few minutes i had it on i ordered in xl having never tried this designer and that was a mistake because i generally wear large or medium it was swimming on me the stripes arent as cute in real life,0
11825,As soon as i saw this dress online i loved it and ordered it unfortunately it just didnt work for me i tried it in a small medium and large for reference im lbs d the dress is really pretty in person but i looked like a little girl in it my daughter who is lbs a also tried it on and she too looked like a little girl in it the material is beautiful along with the detail at the neckline however the neckline is not open like in the picture its more pushed toget,0
11826,I had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady i have no idea what im going to do when the time comes to wash it though well cross that road when we come to it i guess also the interior seams are a bright electric blue,1
11827,I got this dress in a petite xs im and lbs it fit just right i usually wear a regularl xs in most brands but with retailer i noticed i always have to go to the petittes anyway the dress is super cute love the diagonal striping and the draping is not too poofy which is great the material is very lightweight on the bottom which is good for springsummer,1
11828,Ive been looking for comfortable pants for the summer this pants is the answer its comfortable thin and yet not to sheer this pants a bit loose i could fit in s i usually buy size or for shorts from retailer so ill say this pants run big the con with this pants is the stitching around the back pockets is not very sturdy i found tiny holes on other pairs before i bought mine,1
11829,Great sweater coat i bought the camel color and it looks so good over all black it runs large i usually buy a medium in sweaters but his one i bought the small it is very unique and a cool take on a peacoat,1

11840,Gorgeous dress soft silky material and flattering on most body types best purchase ive made at retailer in a long time i get compliments every time i wear it,1
11841,I am waistchallenged i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress sort of like the s styles this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes it has so many colors in the pattern you can wear this with anything and the fabric is so highend and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fallwinter it arrived in the mail and righ,1
11842,Runs large very boxy white fabric on lower portion of the shirt extremely thin it did not look as good as in in picture very disappointing,0
11843,The design is so cute people in different yoga poses small and subtle prints and a must for a yogini i love the colors its colorful but not too bright and its beautiful against the white background i ordered xs im b waist hips and it fit perfectly it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material i like the fact that theres no stretchy spandex feel just pure soft cotton feel its great for gals who are conscious about the arms,1
11844,I am of average height but these pants are so long i considered altering them because i like the print but i dont think its worth the effort for workout attire so theyre going back shame,0
11845,Beautiful overlay runs large had to return for a smaller size,1
11846,Ive been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell which i imagine is some kind of starchchemical to keep the denim stiff with the first pair after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldnt return them the nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them it may be they are made elsewhere now but its disappointing,0
11847,I really wanted to love this dress but i think the proportions are very weird im and usually go for an eight in unstructured dresses and a in more structured dressesit runs small throughout and is too short for me to feel comfortable wearing to work the front is nicely detailed but the back looks weirdly forgotten and could use more detailing i tried on three different sizes and and they all pulled weirdly at the chest theres a little slip that goes with the dress w,0

11850,I cant say enough good things about this romper i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types the material is so soft and is the kind of material that wont easily wrinkle it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with flats and maybe eve,1
11851,I was really hoping to like this but it did not look the way it does on the model at least not on me the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back i am and usually wear a medium or large i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows it made me look bigger and was not flattering material has a nice weave but its thin and delicate i bought the holly deep olive and the blue colors,0
11852,I love the way this fits and feels on it is a beautiful piece and makes me happy to wear i ordered my usual size medium and it fits well the only con is that it is dry clean only,1
11853,I am simply mad about this dress i am smaller on top with larger hips my bust is a mellow b but i could see this working on a or c cups also this dress is extremely flattering for my body type and the bodice fits like it was made for me it fits fine without a bra and just perfectly with a semi padded strapless i got this dress to wear to a summer wedding the texture and color are beautiful and i will pair with simple jewelry and nude heels its a great find and excellent quality definite,1
11854,I did not even pause over this dress on line a white lace dress now well my local retailer at lenox atlanta which has a petites department had this dress in the window with a jean jacket being a lace geek i went in to find it i am a big fan of the feminine and dressy dressed down great window display ideathis picture does not do anything for the dress except wash out the true color the lining is ivory that vintage sepia photo look ivory the lace is lovely ivory too and the,1
11855,This top is so much cuter in person its light and airy and very feminine can be worn casually or dressed up definitely not as fullbaggy as it appears in the photo,1
11856,This sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up but its made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable warm and wintry at the same time it does run true to size i ordered a small and lbs knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season,1
11857,This is a great dress if you dont want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples,0
11858,I love these pants super comfy fit well and a great color i knew immediately when i put them on that i would love them and the button fly to die for wore them and they did stretch out a bit by the end of the day but they didnt look awful and super baggy i bought the other color in a size smaller so they might be better a great pant for summer,1
11859,It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordinglythis does not run smallthis is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with womens apparel sizing i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for mevery small,0
11860,I am petite but chesty and this dress is flattering it is a loose fit but not tight across the bust line i tried it on with nude shoes and it dresses it up i ended up buying this dress in a regular cut s because i wanted it to not be so short which made it look more like a casual dress to wear with the ocean behind you i think it is a perfect day dress to go anywhere and by changing your shoes or adding a thin sweater or short jacket you can go out to dinner or theatre the picture is a tr,1
11861,The dresss is much shorter than described very see thru though guess you can tell from picture expected more for the price,0
11862,This blouse is so beautiful and feminine it fits loosely and is see thru so you do need to wear a cami underneath it it is very comfortable to wear i got many compliments when i wore this blouse all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it however be extra careful when you do wear it im still not quite sure how it happened but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it its so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w,1
11863,Although i havent worn it yet it is very soft and functional i will watch how i wash it so it stays that way,1
11864,What is going on with maeve sizing this season in the past two months ive purchased two maeve dresses that run very smallparticularly at the waist having many maeve items from past seasons and other recent retailer purchases its impossible to ignore that maeves sizing is quite off that aside the vibrant summer colors and material quality are great the skirt is lined but billowy and fuller than ideal strangely its a lot of dress yet not enough at the same time there bodice h,0
11865,Amazing jeans without pockets on the front there are no weird lines like there are on other white jeans with pockets the high waist is extremely flattering perfect for spring and summer,1
11866,Super comfortable summer dress just bought it yesterday and i dont want to take it off soft lightweight fabric,1
11867,The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap its hard to believe this is anna sui i would say this is unwearable there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best going back asap,0
11868,I love this top its wellmade important if youre in chlorine or salt water and has vibrant colors the back strap has two clasp options so not much room for adjustment but i like this fastening method because you dont have a big bow to lay on when laying out,1
11869,This was my go to dress this past summer so easy to wear and pair with cute wedges perfect to dress up or down,1
11870,These jeans fit like a glove while being flatteringly stretchy i am ft in lbs and i have a size these are my second pair of ag stevie ankle jeans and i cant wait to get more they are a beautiful deepdark blue love them,1
11871,I feel both confident and comfortable in this dress it runs true to size though maybe just a little bit large i enjoyed wearing it from the getgo,1
11872,I have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute comfortable cotton undiesuntil i found these these fit like a charm are incredibly soft and dont ride up at all sizing in spot on plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style yay,1
11873,This dress is extremely feminine the liner is the unsung hero here its cleverly designed to be fitted because on a windy day and the dress flies up its a saving grace it has snap buttons and can be detached the fabric is opaque so the dress is not seethrough the fabric of the dress is sheer soft and smooth and i thought it was silk until i read the tag which listed as viscose the details of this dress is breathtaking from the flower design check out the bottom horizontal lines of t,1
11874,Fit great maybe a bit largei bought a l typically i go between a large and extra large and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it this goes with just about everything,1
11875,I agree with the other reviewer the picture does not do this jacket any justice at all the material drapes beautifully and is easily cinched or opened up for slightly different looks i kind of consider it more of a cardigan than a jacket and plan on wearing it over everything i tried it on over workout gear and it looked great than wore it over jeans and a chunky sweater and it looked awesome very versatile and flattering,1
11876,Super soft cap sleeves shirt tail hem and double stitched seams mine is the greygreen motif and tts i bought s b and the fit was perfect the tee can transition into fall as i feel it has a more fall appeal over summer because of the greygreen motif the bluepink motif feels more like summer,1

11879,I ordered my usual medium the tops length came only to my waist and was wide and unflatering the armholes were right under my arms too bad as this looked so cute in the picture i returned,0
11880,I ordered this dress on a whim because i love the classic look it has long sleeves and the color is beautiful i cant tell if there is sparkle in person it looks like it on pictures or holes but regardless love it i tried on both xxs p and xs p and found the xs p was more comfortable for me for those who find clothing at retailer is being made bigger this is more a classic size as in what i would have ordered in the past this summer i had to go down in size a lot the fabric is c,1
11881,I am tall so this dress hits slightly above the knee on me the peekaboo detail on the skirt and shoulders is flirty but still modest this dress is super comfortable and is going to be a summer staple for me i also love that this dress is buttondown it is an easy piece to wear for new moms,1

11883,I saw this online and couldnt wait to get my hands on it my only problem was choosing a color i got the black one it is a bit hairy but soft and smooth as well it feels very high quality it has two nicely placed buttons if youd like it kept in place but its just as nice loosely draped it will work well dressed up or down it runs large but clearly intended to,1
11884,If you want it buy it now this dress is everything and then some love it i bought two the neutral black and the turquoise the turquoise one is a very retro print i am getting many compliments they are so comfortable and flattering im all about this price point retailer more please,1
11885,I fell in love with this top when i first saw it in the store and bought it during the off sale im petite dd usually a size i tried the xs and s and while both fit i like the roominess of the s so i got that size i bought the regular size for a little extra length but could have worn the petite its great for layering because of all the bright colors and although the front is polyester the back is knit so its nice and cool i personally love loosefitting shorter tops so i,1
11886,This is the first time that i have tried mother jeans and i am a fan these jeans fit tts and the high waist is flattering and stays put i personally am a big fan of the distressing its just enough but not too much and its lined on the inside so it wont get worse i know some people wont like that but i did also they hit right below my ankle im instead of being a few inches too long a major bonus thus they look great rolled or not but perhaps most importantly these,1
11887,ft incheslbsshort waisted small bust dd the color is more watermelon pink than that slightly orangey tone thats shown on the website i ordered a six petite because i wanted it to be kneelength the four petite also fit but was a little constricted in the bust the dress is weightless silk i agree with the other reviewer about the bust of this dress its probably not great for large chests because of the ruffles,1
11888,I wear this vest two ways over a long sleeve shirt when its warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when its cooler its the perfect amount of warmth when im running errands and dont want to wear a heavy coat love it and plan to wear it a lot,1
11889,I love jumpsuits in general however it is usually either a yay or a nay and this was definitely a yay i am currently wearing it right now as i write this review the waistband hits perfectly on me i am and about and i bought the large super easy to throw on,1
11890,Ordered this as a gift she said it is great nice fabric great fit,1
11891,Tried the size small regular me a straightish shape broader shouldersits described as slim fit but i found the small to be a loose fit on me i would almost consider trying the xs if i wanted something less baggybut i think the style is meant to be very laidback i tried to picture the extra material i hadthe color is a lovely denim blue and the length on me was just as the website describes deep v neck but not to the point where i feel id need a cami those of,1
11892,The fabric is more sweaterlike than it appears in the image but it makes the dress both cozy and comfortable the skirt is a faux wrap thats secured at the waist by the tie overall the dress is highquality true to fit and very flattering,1
11893,I brought this shirt for a vacation it fitted well and was flattering totally a comfortable wear however after wash on delicate hang dry small holes appeared near the bottom i am hoping i can return it not worth the money,0
11894,Love this easy caftan short dress so soft easy and so stylish,1
11895,This is an awesome pointelle sweater i love angel of the north sweaters i bought the small b and it fit tts the pleats in the back hang without pulling it also flatters the figure with its shaping it is a lightweight sweater in a great shade of red just love it,1
11896,I love this top it is a very soft material and it looks very classy i have worn it with a skirt for work and skinny jeans i have a bigger bust and i wear a small it is true to size very classy,1
11897,Swimsuit shopping can be the worst its difficult to find bathing suits that fit well and are flattering this swim top is a winner the straps are comfortable and the scoop in the front was not too low for a d cup the best part is the higher back a lot of swimwear dips in the back but this does not read eliminates the dreaded back fat my only concern was that it isnt super supportive for larger busts but im keeping it because i love the straps and how it flatters overall this wou,1
11898,I know you cannot tell from the pictures but the fabric on this is incredible it is very light and extremely airy so that it flows when you walk i am a rather petite individual so it would require excessive tailoring for me to wear thisboth in length and in the top i think it was true to size with this exceptionand i wish they offered this in petite i would have tailored the length if it was only that but on the top i am not largechested there was a bunch of extra fabric that just lai,1
11899,Adorable fit the lightweight madras fabric will be perfect for a hot summer day but not seethrough the slightly gathered bottom makes gives my petite frame a taller look easy to wear not fussy no special bra needed,1
11900,I ordered this coat because like others i was taken by its feminine beauty unfortunately the coat showed up with the top button broken off and missing and another button hole torn open i returned that coat right away thinking that itd been damaged somehow in shipping however i began to question the quality of the coat when the second coat showed up with a broken and missing top button when i tried on the coat i found the missing button stuffed into the pocket not the quality i expe,0
11901,I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a due to armholes being being too big i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a when armholes too big plenty of room in body still but i lost some length i do have a short torso so can get a way with this aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge,1
11902,This top definitely looks better in person i thought it looked pretty online but when i tried it on it looked even better this top is on the longer side and fits like it looks on the model the fabric is perfect in my opinion because i dont have to dry clean it iron it or worry about it itching or bothering my skin i am lbs and ab i purchased a size xs and it drapes wonderfully i love the crochet around the neckline the length sleeves and the colors of the,1
11903,I bought these in the olive green in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online i am and lbs long legs and these are beyond adorable some people mentioned that they stretched out i did not find this to be true what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down they are flattering and perfect for the springsummer i would highly recommend and wouldwill purchase in every color well done retailer one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring,1
11904,I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls also the sleeves are a bit long but this doesnt bother me too much at this point very versatile,1
11905,This shirt is a great way to rock the off the shoulder trend you can dress it up or down bi would definitely recommend it,1
11906,I found this dress to be a perfect flowy fit for the superhot tail end of summer this definitely is not a form fitting dress but i bought my regular size medium size and think it fits perfectly i have a pretty small chest and find that sometimes these aline dresses look better if you dont have a lot on top making them tent out just my opinion personally do not think it has an abundance of fabric in fact it is a lot less roomy than a lot of others in this cut due to the embroidery,1
11907,Let it be known that i hate shopping for jeans i recently had my goto skinny jeans rip by my back pocket and new i needed to get something new better stat i have a pair of black ag sateens that i got a few years ago and i decided to try out this pair i got them in the mail yesterday and i never want to part with them they are perfection they hit perfectly on my waist theyre incredibly comfortable and basically make you feel like youre wearing the jean equivalent to yoga pants they,1
11908,The fabric is super soft and the quality is just exceptional the patterncoloring is even more beautiful in person overall an excellent pair of leggings to work out in or run errands in,1
11909,I got fooled by this dresss description its polyester and not wool as it claims to be looks cheapreturned it,0
11910,This is one of the best things ive ever purchased at retailer its comfortable stylish and flattering i ordered it in black and im now ordering the green as well i usually wear small in the dolan line and this is no exception i am lbs athletic build and the regular small fits perfectly,1
11911,This will be a great go to piece with leggings and boots for winter and to transition into spring with wedges i purchased the blue stripe and the multi stripe with the intention of returning one but i liked them enough to keep both the quality of material is great and super soft and i love the little snap detail on the sleeves i am and most always wear a size medium and it fit perfect the dress hit right above the knee but not too high so i can wear the dresses with or without tights,1
11912,Love love love this tunic it has panels that dont really show up in the picture but the panels make it lay really nice its great over leggings and skinny jean cords could even wear it with opaque tights its great for work play or evening i bought the navy blue with the heart print i love it so much ill probably get the green and the red when they go on sale this is a pricey top for reference im lbs ddd fits great all the way around and the length is perfect midthigh an,1
11913,Definitely agree with the other reviewers this top looks great on the model but pretty bad in real life super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs if you plan on ordering id recommend sizing down,0
11914,I completely disagree with the previous review i purchased this dress and i absolutely love it i went out for a couple occasions one being special and the other not so special and both times i received compliments all night my husband loves it and that really says a lot i feel the dress runs true to size and the quality is right where it should be runway worthy absolutely worth s probably not but i personally cant afford that anyway im so happy to have found th,1
11915,This top is sooo cute it does not look like pajamas as one person said it looks like a top its a bit on the boxy style so anything you want to hide below is well covered has a nice length to it is not just for lounging paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great i ordered the xl i am a d for reference and it hung very nicely its extremely soft and very comfy i only wish they had more colors,1
11916,This is a great dress very different and light but cute details,1
11917,This top is very beautiful and the color is a dream but wow is it short im and it barely hit the top of the waistband on my jeans the fabric is oddly heavy and not light and airy like i expected it seemed like an odd choice for a blouse because of the seaming and gathered fabric at the top of this shirt i wouldnt recommend this to women who are bustycurvy on top it made my chest look huge this styling may work for petite ladies but tall curvy ladies beware,0
11918,Love this topi love the colors flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops love love love,1
11919,I love the weight of this dress the mod color blocking the pockets the detail down the side of the skirt the cable knit everything i wear it with a caramel cardigan and brown booties its perfect its a sin to pass it up especially for this price,1
11920,I grabbed this immediately when i saw it in the store the details are beautiful beading embroidery and small opening details on the arms from a practicality standpoint it has pockets its machine washable and it can easily be worn as is with black leggings or tall boots in fall and then throw an additional chunky ivory cardigan on for winter for sizing i am usually a size s and found it to fit loosely but in comfortable slightlyyyy swingy way if i had sized down the shoulder seam,1
11921,I love this stylish sweater i ordered black it is very soft and comfortable i wear it with snaps open or closed looks great either way,1
11922,I really love this dress the material has a lovely feel to the skin silky i typically wear a large occasionally a medium if i wanted this dress to look like the model it would be the large i ended up going with a medium because i wanted to accentuate the smallest part of me rib cage area this made the black portion a tad snug around the bum but it eased a bit with wear but still tighter than model picturesize down if you want it snug normal size for a looser boxier fit either w,1
11923,Love these jeans as they look great with dress shoes running shoes or boots fit well and true to size,1
11924,You will love this cardigan very well made with beautiful details the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans you will love this cardi wish it came in more springy colors i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve the replacement was fine,1
11925,This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable ill probably order it in the other color,1
11926,As the previous reviewer stated this wrap is over sized but that is the style the knit is soft and dense and the metallic accents are subtle and lovely this is an heirloom piece that will last for many many years,1
11927,I love the raw edges on this tshirt and the marled pink is a pretty color the fit is not as oversized as you might expect from the photos order your usual size its very soft and lightweight,1
11928,I bought this to wear for my baby shower at weeks i was able to buy it in my size and still get a great fit and the skirt hits right at my bump with the band just above it great option for expecting mothers that can be worn after baby the top is also snug enough to feel like it covers properly could be too snug if you are large chested though,1
11929,Ive eyed this dress forever and finally decided to buy it i literally read every single review to make sure i ordered the right size im c with a dropwaist that measures based on the reviews i ordered a regular size i tried it on with a bra and also without and the dress fits so well and beautifully both ways but for complete comfort ill probably go without the bra the lining and design dont show anything you dont want seen sitting in it feels great too i,1
11930,I saw an outfit post of a gorgeous lady in this dress so i had to try it its so flattering and well constructed if a little longer than i usually prefer ill just have to wear pumps with it i dont have the right bra so i just pinned the straps to a bit of ribbon in front to pull them underneath the dress it does have pockets also i ordered the and it fits beautifully for reference i have a bust and waist,1
11931,This looks just as good in person as it does online true to size definitely warm but not too heavy comfortable as well,1
11932,This dress reminds me of a fabric used for curtains it is sturdy beautiful and strong i looked like a large picture window in it if i was and pounds it may have worked,0
11933,This skirt is so cute this is a staple to have in your wardrobe i wear it with boots and boot socks but tights for cold winter days as well as flip flops in the summer i got my true size of its fits perfectly i love the length with a peek of leg when you walk,1
11934,I have several pairs of ag jeans and am always pleased with them i had to get these when i saw them in the store im a sucker for cuffed jeans in the spring i also love the dark wash i was surprised when i tried on my usual size that they were too tight i ended up going with a size for reference i am lbs,1
11935,This sweatshirt is very cute on it works well with leggings or skinny jeans its the perfect thing to wear when you want to be comfortable but still look feminine,1
11936,This sweater is absolutely gorgeous the green is a lovely rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft i love the slightly slouchy fit but its far from looking shapeless i bought my usual size small straight athletic build size and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heelsim so happy to have tracked it down in our local store id buy them all if there was more in stock,1
11937,Sheer top runs big usually im a size medium but got small in these very pretty great summer top,1
11938,These are excellent as previous reviewers noted they are a thin material and there isnt much stretch that being said they have a casual workappropriate mens wear vibe the extra fabric in the crotch region contributing to this if you really dont like the extra fabric wearing them a little higher and closer to the natural waist should solve the problem the navy is a little lighter in person than on the site just fyiits less easy to mistake for black which is alright in my book,1
11939,This shirt is the perfect goto classic white button down with a twist the fit is flattering i would have to say runs a little large i am lbs broad shoulders with a d bust and bought the outside of retailer a d usually needs about an i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold hung it up to dry it was fine,1
11940,These run small i am and got a size they were a tad tight on top the waist fit but felt a little too snug short from waist to crotch and then bloomed out in a nice but stiff ish material they are a dark blue animal print i felt like bozo the clown goes to the jungle they looked so silly i had to laugh even with the off these are going back not even comfortable to lounge around the house in never mind being seen by anyone in person,0
11941,Today was my first visit to our new store the sales person had this on and i liked the medium tones of the colors many times i hesitate to order because i never know if the brand will run small and this does not if you wear a medium in michael kors shirts order medium,1
11942,Very nice soft fabric has a nice swingy drape and flair i use it to work out in sleep in and just hang out around the house could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too very happy with this purchase,1
11943,I was nervous about this dress as when i ordered it there were no reviews yetand shortly after they they started coming in and were only negative yes it runs pretty big im usually a large but could tell from the model it would run big but its supposed to be loose i wouldnt say its the most flattering but you can tell its shapeless from the picture its a great casual dress perfect for hot days when i dont want my clothing touching my skin,1
11944,Loved the dress online ordered a petite small fits perfectly i am barely and carry my weight in hips and thighs this fits perfectly without being too snug on the butt so if you are a pear shape get this dress,1
11945,This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same not cute not flattering the model photo is deceiving would not recommend although it looks airy and comfy,0
11946,I have bought several tees by tla and this one is really cute i bought it in the blue stripe size xs it runs slightly larger than most in that size but it will probably shrink a little its not overly baggy just comfy fit i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans the fabric is thin so im not sure how long it will last but until then it will be a keeper in my closet,1
11947,This dress is flattering in so many ways fitted through the bodice with a lovely flare from the waist down to cover those hippy hips sizing is perfect i also bought it in the navyblack color you can dress up with heels or down with flip flops,1
11948,This dress looks so cute in the picturesi love the style ordered typical size and it was hugefelt like many sizes too big,0
11949,Im in love with this print the fabric feels wonderful this is such a perfect transition dress the adjustable waist tie makes the dress fit great,1
11950,I wish i had read more of the reviewsbut thought i would give it a try the shirt doesnt seem as long as on the model but the armpits are sewn to hit mid shirt this would be ok if it was the length pictured but since it isnt it makes you look very boxy i dont know if i ordered a size too big or if it is just the way the shirt was made wanted to love for fallunfortunately i am taking back,0
11951,I bought this dress for an all white event i had many compliments but it was the most fun dancing dress because the top layer spins out it is loose and flowy but the arm holes are rather large and sizing down might have been better i am and athletic and ordered a m and if i had time might have exchanged for a s you must steam out creases before wearing,1
11952,This is a great cold weather alternative to a coat especially in warmer climates it is lightweight but dense love the color,1
11953,Cant love this dress enough i have to force myself not to wear too often i get stopped every single time i wear it to get complimented im usually a size or in dresses went with the after trying both on i found the arms fit better with the im pretty athletic and around lbs,1
11954,The fabric is a little stiff the back looks unusually long compared to the front and it fits tight across the chest and im not busty so thats not a factor,0
11955,Uhm no oh dear no i was initially drawn to this blouses lovely fabric the color and pattern are truly stunning i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy oh boy was i right sadly this is one of the least flattering tops that ive ever tried on at retailer it might be a great maternity top though,0
11956,I absolutely love this dress the pattern is gorgeous and it is so comfortable i have received many compliments every time i wear it i will definitely start paying more attention to this brand when shopping retailer,1
11957,Really comfortable great for casual event or everyday wearing best style with jeans,1
11958,Rompers are my fav so im biased writing this review although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape yes the first couple of buttons are tough to get on but im guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier i got my usual size and it fit like it was made specifically for me im very happy with this purchase,1
11959,The skiers cats and puffin patterns are adorable and i was very tempted to keep the shirts just for the patterns unfortunately the fit was awful i am short and need to highlight my waist and this shirt did the opposite the skier fabric is also seethrough the tenting issue could be fixed if you belt the shirt or tuck it in but it is not very long rayon fabric is a bummer too the shirt was snug at the bicep but not as bad as i expected from the reviews i sized up from an to,0
11960,I just received this top today and as usual retailer doesnt disappoint its beautiful runs a bit generous and has such pretty detail im pounds and always wear a size small this small fits well with just enough room to be a little generous around your waist what a steal dont miss this perfect addition to any wardrobe,1
11961,Love these pants they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together i bought all colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me i am usually a but bought a i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop topsi do wish they came in more colors,1
11962,Dare i say this is my favorite pair of pilcro legging cords yet the pattern is beautiful with green black and grey the fit is as usual stellar and comfortable the best yet,1
11963,This is the perfect holiday dress my best purchase of the season,1
11964,I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide short and crooked after it was washed once it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong,0
11965,You cant go wrong with these pants as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly i ordered a when i have been wearing s in many other styles and was glad for the i thought the fabric was all season so dont agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric i think its perfect everyone is different these are pretty close to yearround wearable,1
11966,Very cute top i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back but that was just my taste i purchased the denim print,0
11967,Love received so many compliments it can be dressed up or down and is so comfortable i did order a l based on the reviews but found it to be big i wouldve returned for a m but it was sold out and i didnt want to risk not having it at all so i kept,1
11968,Loved these in store when i tried them on but was in between sizes so i ordered them in the larger size boy do i regret that these stretch out so much i have to wear a belt with them and it gives me this saggy bunchy front when i sitnot attractive wish i could return them but i took the tag off and wore them not knowing this before hand if in between sizes definitely size down,0
11969,Love this dress very feminine and flattering i would say that it runs true to size or a little big size down for a snug fit at the waist,1
11970,I love this top i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts it can be dressed up or down i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit the button details in the back are such a nice touch i got many compliments on this top,1
11971,This tunic is perfection this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual it does run big i am normally a mediumlarge in shirts and took a medium with room to spare i probably could have worn a small too but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders this is a must buy,1
11972,I bought this shirt in the turquoise color with the navy trim and love it color is as pictured shirt is very soft and flowy the length was a little shorter than expected the slits on the side almost reach the top of my jeans so im glad i got the regular xs and not the petite this shirt is unique without getting too crazy,1
11973,I love this sweater its extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long like i had hoped the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo but i actually like that even better,1
11974,I ordered two sizes when the package came i was skeptical as it was very light and thin both shirts were in the bag the style is just okay the shirt is extremely light weight i was not impressed with the fabric i am returning both definitely did not think it was worth the price,0
11975,This is a gorgeous flowy top i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments you can dress this top up for a night out or for work or style it for a fun evening out you will be very pleased with this top,1
11976,I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse i have a lean athletic torso but i am a dd sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant love the fit though it fits lovely and comfy it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe,1
11977,This top is just adorable so comfy and cute i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back i will be wearing this a lot,1
11978,I bought this skirt yesterday and love love love it very flattering will go with anything i am and size fit perfectly,1
11979,Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels easy piece to wear many ways great quality too,1
11980,I am not a bright clothing person but adore this top if this is the right red for you i highly recommend it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil,1
11981,This vest is awesome the photo does not do it justice you can dress it up or dress it down great materials used does run big so select one size down,1
11982,I love this jacket it is great for lounging because it is loose and comfortable and its great to have pockets to stash stuff in as i shuffle cozily around my house on cold lazy days its not the worlds most flattering fit its kind of boxy but i bought it for comfort and i am delighted,1
11983,There is a reason everyone is giving this dress stars it is stunning flattering versatile and comfortable im a slim athletic size my store only had one of these and it was a medium im generally a small but on the hanger it looks like a slim tube so i thought id try it fits fabulous due to the stretch and shape of the dress id say a size medium could fit a so dont worry about sizing up or down one in this dress suuuuuper stretchy so even though it fits close down throu,1
11984,This is a great shirt but it was big for its size im also short so maybe the petite size would have fit me better,1
11985,This dress is cute and comfortable big but not too big skimming i usually wear a pant and bought a medium and it is great i am on the taller side and the length was great too,1
11986,Great top for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline i am so can do it with top length but not sure someone taller could so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with would probably look cute with skinny jeans but i bought it for skirts adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves really love it but more sheer than i expected great with a nude bra but probably would see other colors through it,1
11987,It is definitely pinned back on the model in the photograph it made my foot frame look short and wide,0
11988,Cute but not sure its worth the price point i might reach for it in sale and while it was cute on i just dont spend that much on a daytime casual dress im sure you could dress it up with heels or something but theres something about this dress that screams casual daytime still very pretty and flattering i loved the neckline and detailing there,1
11989,Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store didnt need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summerearly fall seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons outer fabric is a bit delicatemay snag and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said but works with the dress,1
11990,I bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it its so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details little metal buttons down the front the vent pleats on the side make it feel special i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort it was pretty true to size and because im an average height i wore a small block heel with it,1
11991,Great casual weekend pants and super comfy and great color,1
11992,Im sure theres someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasnt me admittedly im a less than ideal body type at a curvy tall still for a taller person this shirt runs short for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit c,0
11993,This dress is even more beautiful in person it fits true to size and drapes nicely from the body without being tentlike as some swing dresses are prone to be the material is very nice and the pattern is stunning and unique as someone else mentioned you can pair this with a cardi for work its also perfect for a night out its easily dressed up or down and looks amazing with a skinny belt im happy i bought this one,1
11994,I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls i was skeptical of the simple shape but when i put on the green one i didnt want to take it offever i am and thin the small fits me perfectly i loved it so much i purchased the blue as well love love love,1
11995,Loved this sweater when i saw it online when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy i,1
11996,This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out the material is light weight not flimsy you could dress up or down the bottoms are the perfect length im a bit shortwaisted lbs and the small fit,1
11997,I love this dress so much that i bought it in colors one in blue and one in orange great style comfortable and quality material however the cut is much much deeper than it appears in the pictures women with bust should be conscious of that the blue is the better color the orange looks more like a fluorescent redorange still cute but not as subtly muted as it appears in the pics overall great dress even better with the sale price,1
11998,Super cute on i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable the slip is a tad tight but it doesnt bother me its stretchy so its not uncomfortable i bought size xsi usually wear a in dresses i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didnt need the petite i am lbs i loved the soft fabricfine for year round in southern cal,1
11999,This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off but as long as i dont rip it one of these times all will be well it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw,1
12000,The green is a deep beautiful shade the fabric and fir is very flattering,1
12001,Fits well true to size love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match the seethrough part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work only downside is the beige colorkind of a funky bandaidcolored beige but the blue and the green balance it out,1
12002,I saw this dress worn on the street and thought it was lovely the perfect work dress i then found it in the store and my size was already sold out so i visited another retailer and another to find it unfortunately the color blocking on the chest was not very flattering for me it seemed to overly accentuate it i am a dd size the colors the fabric are all wonderful but this dress is not for me,0
12003,The shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering the back felt bulky and looked awkward definitely returning,0
12004,I read the other reviews and from the picture it looked as though it may be a little short so i ordered up to a large the medium would have fit but since im in my mids i felt more comfortable with large but if you are trim and young or young at heart your usual medium will be fine live the material and the navy makes it classy and rich looking can be dressed up or down have worn it to a cocktail party fundraiser with blue crop pants and received many compliments im always challenge,1
12005,I went with my usual size but it is too tight it fits but i would feel uncomfortable in it i ordered the pink one which looks nice in the picture but in person it looks cheap the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the s that beaded neckline added to the cheap look this one is not for me,0
12006,I love these jeans the fit is much better than the white pilcro hyphen slit jean which is cuts lower nice weight not to heavy and not too light in weight these look terrific with the vanja peasant top in the yellow print a darling outfit the lace give them flair and dress them up so i can wear them to work highly recommend,1
12007,I have been continually disappointed in retailers clothing for the past year i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained soso but dresses like these somehow make the cut it does not make sense since when did retailer exclusively market to older women no retailers market has always been young adults this dress is extremely matronly although the bottom print is nice the hot pink belt is completely mismatched and gaudy i really hope retailer starts curating better dress,0
12008,Love this top its very simple modern design can go with many different bottoms and the soft pink color gives it a slight distinction from a plain white tank love it,1
12009,I purchased the tan ish gray colored one in xs it looks a bit mauve in the pictures but is still very beautiful i like the drape of the fabric and the cats on the front the one drawback is that the arms are very snug especially the upper arm and chest i have not worn it yet and am debating whether or not to exchange for the next size up just have to get to my area retailer before they sell out of the size small,1
12010,Beautiful dress lots of compliments will transition well from summer to fall,1
12011,This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho true to size great color lots of compliments,1
12012,I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it but trying it on was a very different story the photo seems to show a wider more welldefined waist with just a small amount of blousing on top but this was not the case yes the waist fit but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the illfitting top turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit sadly this is going right back,0
12013,Beautiful color and super comfy it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top,1
12014,I took a chance buying online im thrilled this dress clings at the top and releases where it should below the bust without looking like a tent a very classy dress for work or play just hope it holds up after a wash as the material is thin but opaque love this dress,1
12015,This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas its light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out,1
12016,This dress is lovely it flows nicely and is extremely flattering also true to size unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glittersparkle which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back wish i could pull off the glitter but cant i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it,1
12017,I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second i love it ive worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan it travels nicely in the suitcase no need to pull the iron out i wear a cami underneath but its really not that sheer so you dont need to its a lovely piece,1
12018,This looks cute on the model but was way too big loose and sloppy for me i probably needed a petite size i ordered a regular xs but returned it it is an okay black top nothing great,0
12019,Wow this is the perfect sweater beautiful soft color lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons it drapes beautifully the knit is tight no see through or snags very soft and comfy the casual easy pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style am starting to love this designer highly recommend,1
12020,Bra s great but it has a lot of pushup padding this might be nice for smaller cup sizes but for a dd it was a little overkillunnecessary,1
12021,I love this blouse its really pretty and very flattering it makes your waist look small i usually wear a size or after reading the reviews saying it ran small i ordered an and a the fit perfectly so i didnt even try the on it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side that is my only complaint,1
12022,I bought the ml lb and love the way it hangs and the length and the fact that it can be worn over a lightweight top the color and feel of the fabric are very nice,1
12023,This dress fits me perfect the only complaint i have is that it was a little snug around the neck every now and then it was a little snug getting in and out of the dress too overall the design is beautiful and it is definitely my new favorite,1
12024,I bought the navy color in xs petite im w athletic build i thought the fit was perfectly fine with a belt the dress is about inches above my knee the dress is made very softbreathable fabric and has a slip underneath bonus the dress is made in the usa ill be buying the white and red once theyre marked down a bit more very satisfied with this dress,1
12025,Tried this dress in a small i am lbs c the small was huge the sash helped some but looked like a potato sack on me also i noticed the fabric was piling slighly in the store i had high hopes for this dress but left this one in the store,0
12026,This jacket is so adorable on i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and its hard to tell what it even looks like ive been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material this definitely does not it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater,1
12027,Loved the sweater and the sale price was great but i could not take the shedding even after just trying it on the first time my jeans and top had shedding all over them this was minutes i could not imagine what i would look like if i wore it all day had to return,0
12028,So comfy im acup it fits well i bought a small an acquaintance of mine has it shes petite w boobs it looks great on her too she has black i have lavender great purchase,1
12029,This tunic is flowy without having too much material to make you look bigger i love the way it fits im lbs and got a small,1
12030,I love everything about this jumper its so comfortable without being too warm its easy to dress up with booties and a hat i suppose the only possible downside is that its slightly tight at the ankles but honestly this is like a dream,1
12031,I received this romper last week and have already worn it twice it is soooo comfortable and the material is really soft the romper is loose yet fitted and very cute i love the open back and the shorts are just the right length i wish there were other patterns or colors available too i would definitely buy again,1
12032,The dress is too loose and runs too big,0
12033,All the positive reviews are right the shirt is great something not entirely obvious from the online photos is that there is a slit on both sides of the shirt makes it even more comfortable and flattering i wasnt sure how i was going to style this for the winter before i received it but as soon as i put it on i had plenty of ideas it looks particularly great with a chunky scarf leggings and boots it looked great with a close fitting turtleneck underneath it really can be dressed up or,1
12034,I ordered a xxs as i am a size it fits very well i am and the dress hits me inches above knee i would wear this with thick tights and boots the sleeves are unlined but because the material is of high quality it does not seem too shear you can belt this dress if you do not like the loose swing style i love the print and colors i was not really aware of the silver sequence at the hem but i do not mind it however i feel it does dress it up taking it out of the every day wear c,1
12035,If any of you have read the book or watched the movie sisterhood of the traveling pants then you will understand this analogy i am convinced that this dress hugs everyone in the right places it looks kind of boring on a hanger but has an incredible fit that complimented my waist so much i instantly felt tinier in every trouble area of my body although the design of this dress is casual i feel that it can easily be dressed up for a nice brunch or meeting i love basic clothing designs tha,1
12036,I love this dressi have it in black and am about to buy it in the blueim usually a but i bought a size it is light and flattering with the gathering above the waistdoes tend to crease a bit but its not too bad love the way it can be dressed up or down think boots or vans or sandles i will dress it up to go out but also throw it on to pick the kids up from school,1
12037,The sweater was nice but not as long as on the model it was itchy also this sweater was not what i had expected their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash sorry retailer i sent it back,0
12038,The mara hoffman crossfront onepiece is worth every single penny the colors are vibranta perfect compliment for my fair complexion the cut of the suit is immensely flattering particularly the definition created at the natural waist the quality of the suit is impeccable and i have never felt so confident in such a little number and guys its reversible inside is a gorgeous royal blue,1
12039,Absolutely love everything about this sweater i was hesitant to buy because its so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame but the xs fits great i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day,1
12040,This tunic is wonderful wash wear comfortable and classic love the trim many compliments on this top,1
12041,I was so excited to order this dress had the perfect red shoes to go with it unfortunately i could have been nine months pregnant and still wear the small i am lb and it was like a maternity dress sad to send it back,0
12042,I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing iti was worried it might look like a sack but i think it is both slimming and flattering i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves a winner,1
12043,I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic the sweater is much shorter than i thought i wish i could return it i bought a size large which is my normal size,0
12044,These pants great casual pants ive received so many compliments mainly because they are flowy and the open panels make them different with the weather so hot they are perfect for keeping you cool very pleased with this purchase,1
12045,I wanted this tank to work so badly it was a great deal and so beautiful unfortunately the top fitted portion ends right below my chest then the shirt flares out so i looked like a cupcake my belly also showed slightly because the shirt is short if you have a short torso this would work great if not unfortunately its not great tear,0
12046,I ordered my usual size however when it arrived it appeared to fit a year old the color and style are adorable i will need to exchange it for sizes larger i am so shocked at maeves sizing,1
12047,Beautiful colors in this dress that can be worn as a swing dress belted with the tie or tied in the back stunning,1
12048,I love wideleg linen pants and im always in the market for them ive purchased these in two colors and have been happy with them so far the waistband is foldover and snug not too tight or too loose the length is longer than advertised im and typically take a or inseam these are long enough for me so they have to be a at least others may complain but im happy,1
12049,Comments the detail is lovely especially the dragonflies on the sleeve and the quality is there with the lining trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape imo you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank i looked at the model after purchasing and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not it is terribly unflattering,0
12050,I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in years i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year but this kind of boxy straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while however i was in a store last weekend and with the additional off i thought it might be wise to give this a try im so glad i did ive now tried it over two fairly girly dresses with tights and booties its not exactly spring in boston yet and i love it,1
12051,This is a stunning dress fits true to size very high quality has a very flattering shape and the lace embroidery is gorgeous,1
12052,I like the soft green color the chino fabric and the casual vibe this dress exudes perfect for spring and early summer runs tts but may be snug for bustier gals wish this had pockets,1

12055,So glad i ordered this dress it fits true to size and is extra soft i was unsure about the color but it looks nicer in person the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring,1
12056,These jeans have definitely made me an ag convert the fit is perfection and at it is so to buy jeans and simply wear them without the typical extra of length,1
12057,I really liked the style and fit of this shirt but im giving it a because i shirt should last longer than months ive taken it to the cleaners times and the fabric behind the tag beneath the collar has fallen apart and there are holes,0
12058,This is a beautiful summer dress i especially love the exposed back which is the perfect cut to not show your bra and feels professional enough for work plus its comfortable drapes nicely and is machine wash and dry,1
12059,I bought this cardigan in both rose and nude and i absolutely love both the weight is perfect for spring and fall and i love the details in the back and the pockets i thought the rose would be hard to match for tops but i have a number of things that work with it it fits true to size in my opinion,1
12060,This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website the style is very flattering fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare i am pounds dd and i bought a size and it fit great the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress this one is a keeper,1
12061,I was so excited for this dress to arrive but when it did it was a major disappointment there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer also the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way the colors were beautiful but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws i am lb and the small fit tts will be sending it back,0
12062,I got the size wrong and the right size was ot available so sad i really loved this,1
12063,I love this top it is sheer so wear a cami but it so pretty i will wear it a lot a winner for sure,1
12064,Got them on sale in blue and love the color they are flattering and i like the waist and pocketed area bc it is also comfy waistband and hips are loose but not too loose tts im and took a,1
12065,I grabbed this pair of pj pants on sale and im glad i did the material is soft and lightweight ideal for summer they fit loose but true to size for a standard pair of pj pants,1
12066,Such a pretty pink feminine blouse love the sleeves great quality and true to size,1
12067,I cant get enough offtheshoulder tops so even though this is out of season i went for itin both colors my only con is the fabric has a slight sheen which cheapens the look a tad like id read in other reviews it does run a bit small for this cut top i just wanted a bit more volume in the neck hole and in the waist since i wont be tucking in if you want it more fitted and ruched around the waist go for your normal size ill be ordering a small in both colors because i know i won,1

12072,This is such a cool topsweater i like simple designs with a twist and the sleeves add that great with skinnies and heels,1
12073,Love the blue color different than many blue tops i own i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering,1
12074,I love the color and shimmer of this dress it is very unique and one of a kind the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor its a great dress,1
12075,This top did nothing for me it billowed in the front and was not flattering for reference i am pounds and small chested i ordered the smallest size the top came in cannot recall if it was an xs or i promptly returned it,0
12076,I never write reviews but these socks are so worth it they are incredibly soft stretchy and hug your feet just tight enough where you dont even realize youre wearing socks but they arent too tighti wash them straight away after wearing so i can wear them again you wont regret it true to color,1

12078,These pants are comfortable and cozy great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands ill be wearing them a lot,1
12079,This dress comes with a built in fupa literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering,0
12080,Amazing dress im a pear shape and this dress is a very complimentary cut for me its also not too short the color print on the dress are amazing im very happy,1
12081,Ive read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but im so happy i did i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining however i think it depends on the person because neither of those things actually bother me i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy i think its extremely comfortable and looks very cute on the zipper d,1
12082,I purchased this dress in the store and then realized i could get a petite size i ordered it in a pm but had to return it i reordered it in ps and its perfect i love it for a casual evening out of wearing around town in the summer its supper figure flattering,1
12083,I saw this online and thought the idea was super cute but was not sure if it would be worth the money because it looks typical but when i went to the store to try it on i saw it was anything but typical the fit is perfect and the fabric so soft i wanted the dress in the green but they were already sold out in my size at the store so i had to order it online i cannot wait until it comes in i will wear this often during the summer,1
12084,This kimono is gorgeous and ive gotten many compliments it looks good with a tshirt and jeans or with something dressier i love it,1

12086,I was very excited about ordering this top as im tall girl ft and i like my back well covered i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material this top is incredibly thin and see through though fabric is nice and soft it feels more like a pajama top all curves bumps immediately stand out and it doesnt look flattering i ordered colors grey and black size large and returned both although they were true to size,0
12087,I wanted to love this dress i ordered online and what you cannot see in the picture if the pleating on the dress i ordered a medium i am usually a large in retailer and the medium looked like a tent i realize this should be loose fitting but it was huge,0
12088,The color is as pictured like a deep coral very comfy and great drape,1
12089,This sweater dress is lovely quirky and comfortable because i have broader shoulders the neckline was perfect on me although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm the dress skims in a very flattering way at first i was dissapointed it wasnt more formfitting but it drapes very nicely i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy so i will probably wear a long silk one th,1
12090,If its a knock off its of the poise dress and a pretty good one at that this is a beautiful dress that took my breath away the moment i saw it when i saw such a poor rating i just had to see why the erin fetherston dress is over more and they look just about the same id rather have the and the look,1
12091,Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket i knew i had to have it trying it on in the store it did not disappoint hei hei is a really wonderful brand and me being a more plus sized gal their sizing is always wonderful i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and topsbut i was able to do a l well the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well like your typical bomber would the fabric is soft and the blush color,1
12092,This is exactly what i was looking for a simple black blouse to pair with a bold pair of pants or skirt falls nicely and the material is quite stretchy making it super comfortable,1
12093,This coat is beautiful i love the color and the design it definitely runs a little large i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already the vest keeps it warm but the sleeves arent lined so its cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if youre going to be in cold weather,1
12094,I put on this tshirt and my husband said it makes you look old he was right im not sure if its the cut or the pattern but i found it completely unflattering on my petite frame and it looked cheap too perhaps on someone else it would look different the pattern is overwhelming and the sleeps are a bit too look and ruched for my liking it may look better on someone taller,0
12095,This is a soft comfortable and flattering alternative to a regular tshirt not dressy but a little more put together looking it also doesnt wrinkle so its my goto travel shirt for warmer months,1
12096,This is an awesome bra it has a reinforced cup underneath although not an underwire which i like i was a little worried that itd be huge as im on the smaller side of the natori b in other bras but it fits well and seems like it would accommodate b or c cup ladies the lace is pretty and it is well made i want more colors,1
12097,I am not sure where all of the other reviews on these pants went but when i ordered mine there were mostly all good reviews i absolutely love these lounge pants someone mentioned that they thought they were a little itchy where the lace is but while they may not be the softest pants ever they are certainly very comfortable not itchy at all i am lbs and i ordered the medium the fit was a little snug at first but as i wore them they stretched and loosened i also wear them with,1
12098,This dress has a beautiful fabric i really hated to send it back it was just so unflattering absolutely no shape to it i bought a p im and lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me,0
12099,These pants fit me perfectlyi am and most days and wore a they are so comfortable i could sleep in them they do stretch a little after wearing linen which can be a good thing to somethey are a heavier linen so good for mild wintersalmost look denimif they came in more colors i would get morethey also remind me of my old hippie days which was fun,1
12100,This coat is wonderful its boxy and drapes really nicely the colors are beautiful and versitile i love the pockets the fabric is sturdy but not heavy i have nothing but good things to say about this coat i had to return it sadly since it wasnt flattering on my hourglass shape i am dd and the small fit well if youre confident enough to hide your waste go for it your wont regret it,1
12101,Tts and very feminine and flattering looks same as on model love this style if you like style highly recommend armholes not too big yay,1
12102,I ordered these in the pinkish color and i love them im lbs and the size small fits perfectly they are definitely sheer but theyre advertised as a coverup so that was expected these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top bikini bandeau or even tankini the price is great especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms no pockets is the only negative,1
12103,I love this jacket its the prettiest and most stylish jean jacket ive ever owned the sleeves run small im an xs but chose a small so i can button it and wear thin sweaters underneath,1
12104,Ive wanted a vest for the past few years and could never find the perfect one until now the material is perfect and the colors are amazing its definitely a vest that you can wear all year i would recommend this,1
12105,This versatile tunic is a mini dress on me dd when i wear size l and warm sweater when i wear size m i love the boxy yet flattering cut the cute neckline and the warm smooth knit fabric wish i had gotten my hands on the cream colorway,1
12106,Wore this got many compliments true to size elegant,1
12107,There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress i wish the pictures shown were more accurate,0
12108,Bought this in store yesterday light fit and extremely comfortable im and have a long torso so i ended up going with a large in this one because i like my shirts to hang loose print is more vivid in person but nonetheless a great but,1
12109,This is my third marrakech jacket in as many months i love it i was hesitant to order it because of the beige color luckily it is more of a green beige it is a very flattering jacket and yes you do want to size up this jacket is so comfortable i usually leave it on when i get home because i dont want to take it off i am b and the medium fits great,1
12110,I agree with the other reviewer this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen it is kind of stiff with a little give a perfect a line the waist is a little tight so i sized up usually wear a and the was perfect for me wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one,1
12111,This dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed however the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering,0
12112,Really comfortable dress to wear pretty flower design good fabric and ribbon details are well placed thankful it came with a cotton under slip because its very sheer fabric and i didnt have to think of what to put underneath have worn it twice since it shipped and im really happy with my purchase online order and shipment was super fast too,1

12117,I love this top and bought it in both colors whats really fun is that i found a pair of espadrille sandals to match the sandy beige and white colored top and i have attached a photo of me under my arbor to show you these tops are designed to have a flattering fit i ordered size small and they are not too tight i am c in the bust line and an hour glass figure on bottom i love that they are off the shoulder a bit and in a v neck which is flattering on me the material is soft and of good,1
12118,I love off the shoulder looks and had high hopes for this top unfortunately the folded top portion doesnt stay down at all i found myself pulling at it all day and eventually gave up the material is also not the best,0
12119,I really like the gentle flow of the fabric this top can be worn casual or dressy by adding jewelry or or a scarf,1
12120,I wouldve looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy im usually a m but went with the s bc it looked better fitted this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy i cant wait to wear would look great with white jeans,1
12121,This tee is super comfortable it feels and looks like a well worn favorite right off the rack although it only comes in sml sizes and i wear an xs ab lbs the small fits well no gaping armhoes to worry about the pics dont show that the tee does trapeze out somewhat but it is not to worry about i purchased the reddish color which is a wonderful faded maroon shade i will be getting the black one as well,1
12122,Ive been looking at this dress online for some time now but ive been put off by the photo of the woman wearing it on the boat it just did not seem right but then i saw it in the store and i was sold on it it is a wonderfully soft linen dress it is a bit tight in the midriff so i had to size up a bit i usually wear a size but went with size this time size fit perfectly it is comfortable easy to wear just the right amount of sexy it will be a nice every day dress for summer i,1
12123,At i usually have to order items in petite and sometimes still have trouble fitting properly into items but i was able to buy this sweater in an xs i figured with the high front and low back i wouldnt be able to fit it but it looks great on not only is the fit amazing but it feels amazing as well its such an easy wear and the highlow look is effortlessly chic,1
12124,This shirt is so pretty and casual however with a nice scarf it can also be worn to a nicer restaurant it also hides all my flaws the only concern i have is its a bit thin material and not sure how long it will last having said that i love how the material looks and falls on my body i love it so much i bought a white shirt as well as the lavender,1
12125,When i ordered this dress i thought to myself hmm it seems a little close to showing some side boob but maybe thats just the angle of the photo flash forward to me trying it on in my home yep thats some side boob it is very low cut under the arms if youre super slim this might be a good look but on a curvy gal with some boobs it was obscene also im a solid in most retailer brands so i ordered a l and an xl just in case the xl wouldnt even zip up returning,0
12126,Tts and comfortable this t shirt brings flair to everyday wear and i purchased on sale for a steal,1
12127,I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper looks like crusty white rust see attached pictures the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers lately the quality has been declining a,0
12128,Just purchased this lovely sweater over the weekend during the off sale i went in to buy the rona sweater in grey which i think is the same style with different name but it was all sold out the sa pointed me to a rack of these sweaters and i am happy with this choice the back print is really cute and the sweater design and color is very flattering it goes well with pants or skirt and the front is not as short as i had imagined the rona sweater to be,1
12129,Love this sweater its really flattering long and lean though not tight just the right amount of shape and length for my size i run between and and a and im about i ordered the medium i love the contrasting knits of the sleeves and body of the sweater i only wish it came in more colors id order it again,1
12130,This top fits well as expected for the size i love the ease of the top and wear it both casually and a bit more dressed up great styling on the back,1
12131,I got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store we loved that this could be worn stand alone with leggings or as an overshirt its very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe,1
12132,Online photos do not do this skirt any justice i agree with a previous poster i normally never buy anything brown but there are pops of teal and magenta throughout you cant see the gorgeous shimmer and the interesting layered colors online in addition this skirt has a stretch waistband plus for the holidays and is so flattering not too tight but shows just enough of your curves physique i like that the skirt is longer as well will look cute with boots i purchased the size medium,1
12133,This jacket was a gift for my daughterit fit like a glove and she loved it,1
12134,The dress was just too ill fitting and bulky and large it was more matronly looking then anything and did not fit well if you are going to try it probably size down sizes for reference im and lbs i bought my normal size and it was very large i would not recommend as its just not flattering i love one shoulder dresses and tops so was very disappointed as im an retailer devotee,0
12135,This dress is very feminine and flattering on especially for hourglass figure gals i usually wear size regular in this brand but i sized up to regular im b waist hips when its very fitted on top i like my dress to be a bit longer the bottom hem falls about inches longer on me than shown on the model im it feels tight when first zipped because the dress is cut to fit the curves of a woman but it loosens up after a few minutes of wear the design of this dress is,1
12136,These tights are amazing if i care for them well i know they will last me seasons upon seasons,1
12137,This dress is just absolutely adorable you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress this dress does run a tad bit large im usually a size but the size was slightly too big for me best purchase yet,1
12138,I love pilcros jeans they fit adults without being mom jeans the quality is great the legging cut is simple with just the right amount of stretch theyre a tiny bit short but i like to show a little skin in booties,1
12139,The fabric and color is stunning very well made im and this romper works fine it is long enough in the body true to size love it,1
12140,Beautiful lightweight cardigan the sheerness is really pretty ordered one for my sister too,1

12142,This is a beautiful dress figurehugging but covered up in places that need it color is flattering and soft wore with bainbridge layered necklace bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps so versatile will work for church or cocktail partygreat purchase,1
12143,I love this jacket over a dress its snug fitting so cant wear anything bulky under it but super stylish and comfy stretchy material its a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me,1
12144,I ordered this in a s for reference i am lb dd with a waist and it fits nicely i have a fairly large chest but i didnt find that the pleats laid awkwardly or overaccentuated my boobs but i got the purple motif so the pattern and the higher neckline may have helped keep the top looking cute and stylish but still modest on me the top drapes a little more than than it does on the model but its flattering and not at all sloppy thanks to the fabric which has a jus,1
12145,I tried this on in the store and loved it it runs large im lbs very short waisted and i got the xs i realized it had a sheer section on the side but the store paired it with a beautiful scarf that helped cover the sheerness i didnt feel i needed a cami while wearing the scarf plus the scarf will keep me warmer and let me wear the shirt a little longer in the fall,1
12146,Normally hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses this dress is a big thumbs down as most of these reviewers and myself point out the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you dont just get a peak of your bra you get to see the whole side of it secondly the bust of the dress would work only for an acup bra too small for the average woman the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself excelle,0
12147,Very graceful long skirt runs true to size and looks great this is the kind of dress you will wear all summer long,1
12148,This top is adorable i finally broke down and bought itso happy i did fits goodnot too long sits at hip were it should very flattering i went with the reviews and sized upi am a petite sx normally in retailerbut went with what the reviews said and got a reg small glad i didit is a bit snugnot tight in the chestbut has stretch to it i am d if you are bigger in the chest i would recommend a medium i got the purple motif print no see thru issuesthe material is a comfortab,1
12149,These run a tiny bit large but im still keeping them they are so soft and comfortable,1
12150,Material cheap too small good idea for design love princess cut but bad material good idea though sending back,0
12151,I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store the medium fit good and looked great i cant wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it,1
12152,I love these pjs i thought for the set was a little too pricey for me but as soon as they went on sale i knew i had to have them they are so light and fresh perfect for the texas heat it helps that the print is absolutely precious as well,1
12153,Im a size in retailer pretty much across the board size bottom top generally go for the xs and i ordered this in a based on other reviews its definitely not a winter coat which i understood its not for layering over a heavy sweater either i wish i had ordered the size instead so that it was a little snugger in the waist as is i can wear it over a shirt dress or light sweater and thats fine but unlike other reviewers i dont think you need to size up if you want the,1
12154,Was hopeful this might work on my petite pear shape i am probably lb one to two sizes larger on the bottom when i first saw online so went to store to give the regular size a trial run before ordering the petite size online you can never tell with these flare dresses some just make the hips look so much worse and havent had a lot of luck with casual retailer flare dresses this season first tried on the medium and fell in love instantly was looking a little big but thought orde,1
12155,Such an easy to wear and nicely cut summer dress it does not wrinkle has pretty colors and fits very well i havent washed it yet but i like the idea that it can be machine washed highly recommend the fabric is good quality a little bit thick for hot days though,1
12156,I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors i wish it came in white and in black because its a great basic i think it also works well for business casual attire,1
12157,Ive been hesitant to try on rompers in part because they seem complicated and i also too worry that i would look a bit like mutton disguised as lamb in one of them however i saw this romper and fell in love with the pattern and had to try it on the pattern and color are wonderful and i instantly felt glamorous like betty grable in a cute cheesecake photograph i had to buy it and have since received tons of compliments on it and i have yet to feel that i am too one foot in the grave t,1
12158,Theres something wonderful about this tee its the way it fits it hangs so nicely and is a wonderful year round item i bought it in black for myself and one for my daughter she ordered another color and i did too when i bought it one of the gals at the store said it had been such a popular tee this year and once i put it on i understood why i give it a high rating,1
12159,I bought this sweater in the gray color and love it it is so very comfortable very soft it looks great with jeans or leggings,1
12160,I received this coat today and im ecstatic about my purchase i am a true petite and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews yes the button is low but that is the style i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short otherwise the fit may be completely off,1
12161,This dress is just what i was looking for i ordered it in late summer it was back ordered and i ended up wearing it on thanksgiving day its so comfortable and just the right length i wore it with leggings and boots but it will be just as great with sandals in the spring,1
12162,This is a very flattering pencil skirt i found it in the store and bought an xs and have been wearing it to work it is not too short and the wrap fit looks great,1
12163,Love the patterns and the length i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets its really a special piece and on sale very worth it,1
12164,I love this jacket something to get cozy in on cool california winter nights and still light enough to wear open and walk around without getting too hot i am and have a medium frame but dd on top i bought a medium because i hate things to be tight around my chest and this is perfect my only disappointment is that i wish it had pockets i got the wine color and it is very beautiful wonderful unique and comfortable jacket i do recommend it,1
12165,I purchased the poppy tunic in gold its a beautiful rich color and overall am super happy with the cut of this sweater retailer has been emphasizing oversized flouncy tops for a few years now that do nothing for those of us with small waistsbig booties this top is just the opposite and i hope to see more like it the wide neck is graceful and the sweater curves in nicely without hugging the body,1
12166,Best beachy summer tunic in the store can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight can be worn over jeans shorts a bathing suit take your pick wear it with a tankcami underneath or not it works wither way asymmetrical cut great for us longlegged tall people fabulous buy only con is that its a tad delicate unfinished hem and looseknit will easily snag if you arent mindful i recommend hand wash air dry,1
12167,I loved this on the cover of the august catalog when i saw the pictures online i was a bit hesitant because the background of the dress looked white and i wondered whether it would be too washed out for me not so i love it it fits beautifully the waistline is very flattering it looks like a dress a model would wear in the s not a hippie but a model in a high fashion magazine it looks great with boots the fabric is soft to the touch so luxurious i am of polish and lithuanian d,1
12168,These are the best leggings i have ever worn and i wear a lot of leggings i am tall and lbs i bought a sm they very soft and warm they stay up perfectly and do not pinch or make any lines i am amazed that they are so inexpensive i am buying more after this review,1
12169,Retailer has incredible service and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it however this dress cannot be cleaned i saw a stain on it after the first use so i first tried hand washing it however the black part of the dress came off on the white part making the stain worse i then tried dry cleaning it the care tag allows both and that produced or new stains where the black rubbed off on the white its a beautiful striking dress that would be great maternit,0
12170,Beautiful and very feminine look but run big i m ft lbs curvy size fit me well,1
12171,This is a very pretty summer top the detailing at the neckline adds interest and the floral pattern is gorgeous one note in the picture the top appears to have a white background but it is actually more of an ivorycream color this is definitely a swing top style with a lot of room in the body i am and normally wear a medium or in retailer tops i ordered a small in this top and it fit great at the top but was almost too large in the body of the top i am considering,1
12172,I bought this on a whim because the colors were so me and fell in love with the bows and button back i wore this over a lace peplum and opened up the bottom buttons of the button back for a fun layered look true to size as i was in my normal size small lbs c definitely check this out in person,1
12173,I bought this dress to wear as a casual summer staple i like classic things with a twist and this fits the bill it is nice quality and the colors are vivid it is slightly tight in the bust line for me but it is not retailers fault that i am a bit too busty for this dress ill deal with it otherwise the dress is nice quality and will come in handy throughout summer the price is right so grab it,1
12174,The first thing i noticed upon receiving this dress is how soft it is and the fact that it wasnt wrinkled coming out of the packaging bag an excellent quality my next surprise was to find that it is fully lined with a very nice soft knit and felt awesome on i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly it was fitted through my waist and hips chest waist hips and dropped straight from my hips just like i like i was afraid it would be too sheath like for my figure but it is perf,1
12175,This is a beautiful shirt dressy imo its tts i would not size down in this shirt can wear w black white moss khaki jeans etc love it,1
12176,Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected it is soft to the skin and flattering however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders,0
12177,This dress is gorgeous as displayed at store color is vibrant but the one i ordered looked dull and wrinkles very easily i wore it to a ceremony and the seatbelt left me wrinkled before i arrived the top is very wide and best to wear strapless,0
12178,Let me start off by saying how pretty this top is and heavyand itchy you would have to stand like the model does in the first shot to wear the top with your arms not touching any part of the top the sequins will itch if you put your arms down underneath the armhole another reason i didnt like the top was because the should straps are unadjustable i would have to get mine tailored for my frame i usually wear a medium or in tops and ordered this in a medium it was roomy,0
12179,Love love love this in the pink not as big a big of the offwhite but its nice too,1
12180,I love these pants the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short im but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist my new favorite summer pants,1
12181,I tried on almost every dress in the shop today and this is the dress as soon as i tried it on i started twirling around i felt beautiful and i couldnt stop smiling my mother said that it makes my blue eyes glow it flatters my figure by hanging perfectly across my bustline floating over my curves and camouflaging my little unappealing bumps also the dress is cut nicely under the arms which allows coverage for a strapless bra i chose the medium size even though i usually wear a large,1
12182,I ordered this dress in a size my normal size at retailer it is a lovely dress and so feminine but it is incorrectly sized i couldnt begin to button it i reordered it in size if that tells you anything buyer beware unless you are itsy bitsy you need to size up i will say that as pretty as the photos are the dress is even more lovely in person,0
12183,I love this dress i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style,1
12184,Nice top the material is soft and drapey i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket,1
12185,This dress had an odd fit very loose on top with pointy darts very tight on bottom fabric was stiff so it didnt move well with me,0
12186,Love this jacket it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time i was surprised at how affordable it was my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color,1
12187,When i first saw this online i knew i had to have it so when dresses were off i grabbed the deal its perfect its super soft and an appropriate length i love the bell sleevestheyre ultra feminine and slightly trendy but not too much i definitely recommend this dress reference ish lbssize in jeans xss in tops and dresses and the small fit me better than the xs,1
12188,The color of this top is a bit more vibrant than online material is light but i can wear a beige bra underneath and not need a cami fit was true to size for me and detail at the neckline is flattering a keeper for me,1
12189,Cute little sleep mask the elastic band is wide so it doesnt ever feel like its digging into your head does a very good job keeping out light,1
12190,I love this brand and the fits perfect i am typically an in retailer skirts and this is no exception medium to heavy weight soft denim which is more of a darker denim shade with a wide aline cut the pockets are distinct and give the skirt character it is pretty long and full looking on my inch height i purchased this on sale plus promo and very happy i was able to receive it as it became a sold out style in my size the hem is a wide stitch hem and gives it a nice look i look forwar,1
12191,So beautiful fabric hangs great lovely detail fits well and feels great,1
12192,I love this cozy jacket i wanted a neutral colored jacket for casual outings this does fit true to size i am and pounds i purchased the xs you can cuff the sleeves to shorten the length of the arms it has a piping so it doesnt look odd if cuffed i do find most thingsbrands at retailer run big on me but not this item,1
12193,I ordered online and got it home tried it on and loved it it is too cute i plan to wear it with bright colored belt and shoes probably red yellow or pink plus i bought a polka dot tote same color cream and black and a blazer cant wait to wear it i love the fact that i can wear it spring summer fall as well winter with my blazer im keeping it,1
12194,This was the best purchase of the summer its cute and comfortable without being too baggyloose i get compliments every time i wear it fits true to size i bought the floral orange one couldnt be happier,1
12195,Ive tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow i wish they would offer more colors,1
12196,Given that tunics and thighlength dresses are the hot new thing this season i kept finding that my blackonlytights collection wasnt going to fly with my cute new tops and boots so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didnt look cheap or inauthentic in color and found these i bought them in blue gray and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces they look more rustic than the average tight almost like they are leggings not tights they are a lit,1
12197,Im obsessed with this dress its so pretty and love that it has a lining im and got a small i had dry cleaner take it in from the sides so i didnt look swallowed up in dress and now its perfect still has the swing but not as bulky cant wait to wear it out,1
12198,Love this top its great for wearing with leggings the material is soft and not too heavy love the variation the zippers give you i have in the moss and love it,1
12199,Extremely soft and comfortable fit very well should travel really well,1
12200,I bought this dress for the kentucky derby i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful i paired it with a lavender hat and i was ready for a mint julep i usually wear a or a so i ordered both the fit best i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come stunning,1
12201,These pants are simply darling i purchased them with my birthday discount thank you retailer and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny flattering and the most important feature of any pant makes my butt look good dont hesitate buy these today before they are out of stock the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality,1
12202,Love this dress i have it in white just washed it in cold water in the machine and it still looks like new very cute and comfortable i stitched up the slit a bit i am older but otherwise perfect,1
12203,I love the way this top fits and the way it flows i have it in two colors,1
12204,This top in the remaining blue green is not the top pictured its like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland the color is deep and beautiful the neck is high the lace is floral theres a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it theres no reason for hesitancy at the sale price,1
12205,I tried on this top and it looked fine until i tried to move you cant lift your arms i tried on a larger size but still felt like the movement was limited in the back and arm areas,0
12206,I got this jacket in the gray the fit is amazing and it is soooooo comfortable i love that it is a bit less structured but still looks polished,1
12207,I bought this dress in the green color and i am absolutely in love with it it is very figure flattering and looks great even though i have a larger bust it is also a great length hits about an inch or two above the knee highly recommend,1
12208,This is a very beautiful dress with the detail of the inside lining with a very beautiful fabric as well creating a double layer effect it creates a great flow i am not sure i would use it with the belt which is beautiful a part of it is crochet but if i dont the dress would be too long i am a size xl and so if you are shorter than that i would try it before buying it since its getting cold here in colorado ill have to wait for next year to really experience going out with,1
12209,I decided to try this dress on based on the other reviewers positive words and i wasnt disappointed its so cute and stylish i plan to wear with black boots im lbs c wear a or and i got a one thing at the waist the pattern breaks a bit and doesnt match perfectly i tried on a second dress and liked its pattern more than i did that of the first i tried,1
12210,I knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section its effortless love the quirky design and the overall fit its a tad on the large side but im all about the flow these days oh and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge fantastic piece,1
12211,Purchased this in two sizes because other reviews said it runs small i found that it was true to size for me cant wait until it is warm enough to wear it,1
12212,I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage just washed both pairs according to care instructions no spills stain remover or anything but detergent and both came out with light spots all down the leg very sad to have wasted all that money,0
12213,I have the pink plaid pippa and this mint one is nothing like it but in a good way shorter sweet embroidery but the same swing silhouette and drop waist style this dress is a little oversized so if you want more fitted look you can size down stay tts if your busty like me imo the mint looks more sky blue than green i got the medium regular and im dd and ends at my knees,1
12214,Had my doubts and ordered on sale just to try am amazed how often i have worn this jacket goes with a lot of pants and skirts great buy on sale am lbs and medium is perfect,1
12215,I agree with the othersthis is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago i love my new sweater i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath the sleeves are itchy,1
12216,Im usually a fan of maeve but this dress is just bad the fabric is thin and filmy and it stretches to sheer over your chest the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose it just droops in a most unfortunate way,0
12217,I bought this today in black it fits true to size and is very flattering i love the draping the weight of the fabric and the length i would buy it in another color i like it so much i will probably wear this with jeans and boots with a sweater over it i wasnt sure i was going to like the little connector piece across the front neckline but it works if it wasnt there the top would probably gape open,1
12218,I absolutely love mother jeans but i unfortunately had to return these ones this particular style seemed to run pretty small too i always size up in white jeans and even the size up that i had ordered were just too tight i typically wear a in mother and ordered a in these,0
12219,I have been a paigepilcro lover for years these mcguire jeans went on sale and i loved the neutral color so i ordered my usual size they fit perfectly as a previous reviewer started they are tight they are skinny jeans and are meant to be tight they hug in the right place are not too high waisted and are a sturdy denim for reference i am short waisted and usually wear a in paigepilcro these mcguires sized were a great fit good length no hemming required,1
12220,A sales associate handed these to me while i was trying other things on i had never tried the hoxton before i have found my perfect black jean they are so comfortable and they dont stretch out like others i have tried i am and i roll them a few times but i like that look i am usually a and that is what i took in these,1
12221,After being tentative to splurge on skinny jeans ive always been a small flare jeangirl i am thrilled to say i love these jeans the rise is perfect in that it holds in anything you want held in and makes a slim shirt look even better i have worn them with booties and regular boots alike and have no complaints i was unsure of the jeans claim to not stretch out but have been pleasantly surprised at how they have kept their shapeeven after sitting for many hours at a time wash cold,1
12222,I wish i had read the other review about the color of the pink version of this sweater before i ordered it she was absolutely right the color is completely different in person it is this garish pink and brown that looks like it was knit together with remaindered yarn its too bad because the cut of the sweater is cute and the zipper adds a funky touch maybe the blue is better in person,0
12223,These jeans are great for the summer they have a great high waist fit and stretch with you very very comfortable rinse is light making them a little casual but they can be dressed up with heels love them,1
12224,Gorgeous dress colors as appear in picture thick material quality is good sizing im usually a size or small got a small and it is big in the chest length is below the knee would recommend a size smaller than normal not a huge deal small alteration job,1
12225,This is my very shirt i have ever bought at retailer its very comfortable and fashionable,1
12226,I have this top in colors and am waiting for the black to arrive very soft on the body we live in fl so lightweight is appreciated stylish fit that is not ordinary great colors will pack well and can be dressed up with a scarf sleeves run long,1
12227,Perfect lace tank i am six feet tall and this top hits me about where it does on the model i ordered xl and feel it is a generous tts it is very figure flattering and not too tight across the bust it has a thin lining so no camisole is needed so beautiful,1
12228,I was a bit confused with all the reviews here some said this runs small and others said it runs bigi decided to go to the store and try it im and lbs im usually size or xswhen i tried the blue one xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneathhowever when i tried the beige one xs fits me well with some room for sweatereither one is beautiful great quality as you would expect from this brand,1
12229,This sweater is so cute and classic and ive gotten so many compliments its so gorgeous the wool is sooo warm recommend,1
12230,I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person and it was love at first sight the black and white makes it versatile and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward more importantly the pattern is cleverly designed which doesnt compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern as shown on model i purchased the regular xss and it fit me fine im b waist and hips and the hem falls about two inches below my knees the,1
12231,The design of this sweater is odd it made me feel very round when i put it on the sleeves were wide the other reviewers were correct in saying that its a thick sweater which i thought id like the torso was slimmer and longer than i expected it really was the odd design of the sleeves that made me not like this sweater,0
12232,This is a beautiful color and nice heavier fabric love the style armholes not too big the body is loose fitting at torso but chest area is fitted at c size small i love this top with skinny jeans or pencil skirt as shown on model top looks just like it does on model as far as fit,1
12233,I was not in the market for a black blazer but saw this in store and had to try it on the quality of the fabric and overall aesthetic is fantastic love love love the gold buttons this will look great for work with jeans or even as a cover up over a cute dress i am a generally a size medium sometimes small and tend to fall between a and i went with the in this jacket,1
12234,I ordered pair of these pants and the dye ran everywhere when i washed them according to instructions and then it came out with weird lines and splotches in the pants i sent them back and retailer was very nice about replacing them i have yet to wash my nd pair but we will see,1
12235,These pants are so comfortable theyre very flowy and provide so much airflow to keep you cool during hot days i actually bought these pants for work im a teacher i like to pair them with a white top and a cardigan the waist band is elastic which is super nice the only thing i would like better is if the waist line was higher the pants come up right below my natural waist so theyre not quite as high waisted as i would like but other than that their silky material give them the ill,1
12236,I purchased this in store and the red motif is short sleeved as pictured the pattern is fun vibrant and great for summer months its a more substantial weight fabric not sheer or clingy the fit is tts and it is a slightly longer length which i loved,1
12237,I fell in love with this top the minute i saw it best of all i was not disappointed when i tried it on the fabric is soft and looks classy the color is a rich and deep emerald green and the quality is really nice you can dress it up or down depending on the occasion this top will look gorgeous with a nice pair of jeans or a dressy skirt true to size,1
12238,I love this romper i wear it as lounge wear around the house and to bed it shows a bit more skin than id be comfortable showing in public but perfect for around the house im usually a medium but it hung on me weird so i sized down and its absolutely perfect love the color the fabric and how it falls just right and the ultra softness is heavenly,1
12239,This is my new favorite top looks and fits as described,1
12240,Love this skirt very fun and feminine it is a great fit and i love the layering contrast of stripes length goes right to below my knees which is perfect for me i am petite and curvy,1
12241,This is a great piece to add to your wardrobe the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great i got the pink which surprised me because i wear so much black the length fits longer than most rompers which is great it makes it a classic fit i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up the waist has elastic but its snug,1
12242,This top would have been better if it had a stretchy fabric being large breasted makes this top a little tight still so pretty so im keeping it makes me look a little less chesty,1
12243,I feel fabulous in this plum and charcoal vest i am and the ml is the perfect length and size i was initially attracted by the external seams and color and was delighted with the silhouette and soft structure of the wool blend fabric it is versatile and yet a kind of signature piece that i will wear with joy,1
12244,I bought this cardigan to take on a trip to the middle east it turned out to be a great purchase the weight of the sweater is substantial enough to add warmth and not just style i am not a huge fan of lightweight sweaters as i tend to be chilly all the time i was concerned that the design of the back might accentuate my rounder backside however it drapes very nicely i am petite with moderate curves i typically get the xxsp and this was perfect the neutral color is great with almost,1
12245,I adore this top lovely color fit is very flattering can dress up for work with a skirt or down with jeans,1
12246,I love this skirt it does run a little small i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist but still works i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned ive been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it i also work with kids and they all love it as well,1
12247,I love these jeans another winner in the pilcro line i took a size i normally wear a depending on cut i am inches and about lbs curvy with small waist and the fits comfortably and very flattering to my figure love the button front and the red details i recall having jeans like these about years ago and this cut is so perfect cute and stylish the regular length hit just slighting above the center of my foot so wearing with flats will be perfect i am not a high he,1
12248,This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back the colors are beautiful and rich i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season the top does run a little big i sized down to a medium i am just under and am a g,1
12249,I ordered a small which is my usual retailer size but this was like a tent on me its fine if you like things super super blousey but that wasnt what i was looking for also it is very long a very weird amount of long also there is only eyelet on the front the whole back of the shirt is just plain fabric i like the idea of this shirt but all in all it was very disappointing,0
12250,I have wanted a fleece jacket for ages for warmth and practicality but im not the sporty type this is the perfect alternative i got it in wine and use it over a cardigan and dress or jeans it is a lovely color and passes as wool this is one of the best things ive ever purchased at retailer highly recommended btw it runs quite big im generally a medium to large but the small is perfect on me,1
12251,I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly theyre amazing they look just like the picture feel great on dont slip in the waist zero negatives i cant wait to wear these bad boys out,1
12252,I ordered a size xl in the mango the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think its truetosize it looks like its intended to have a loose flowier fit throughout the dress the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being and im under yet the length is the same it fits me at kneelength too i thought it would hit a little longer based on the models info for the photos and getting the regular sizing the one thing i wish was different is to have it,1
12253,Im always searching for a dressed up tees and these were fabulous true to size and great quality,1
12254,I saw this dress in the store window and had to try it on and it is perfect its lined got pockets can wash at home and is a work appropriate length its cold in the northeast right now so im wearing it with tights boots and a cardi i really like that it isnt fitted but is form flattering overall win,1
12255,This skirt is hot i love it and would marry it if possible super pretty the jewel hem looks awesome buy it we can be twins,1
12256,I bought this for myself and my mom and we both love it i got it in a small and almost wish i had gotten it in an xsmall its super comfy and appropriate for work,1
12257,This dress is made well the constructionsewing details give the dress a beautiful shape it has a nice zipper at the back and fabric feels light pockets are a good size skirt flows but doesnt feel heavy fit is comfortable i typically wear somewhere between a size i ordered a and it fits just right im and it falls below my kneelength is nice armholes are a bit lower than i thought but not too low its a classicmodern look it was sold out when i first wanted to buy it,1
12258,This dress can be casual or you can dress it up for going out i just love this dress,1
12259,I have these in grey and i love them they are so comfy i got them in ml even though i am a sm because i like the loose fit they are very soft,1
12260,This dress is amazing nice material comfortable and really flattering slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect highly recommended,1
12261,Can easily be worn with boots or sandals multi season dress comfortable flattering cut slightly roomy but pretty true to size,1
12262,I loved this top online but it arrived very wrinkled which raised a red flag as to how it would look after wearing it seemed high maintenance also didnt love the fit color is vibrant but overall not a fan of this top,0
12263,Love this top for the fall looks great with dark skinny jean and booties,1
12264,Love this sweater it feels so soft and it slides right on over the head and neck easy to wear this is my favorite sweater i wear it all the time the lilac is a really nice subtle color as well meant to be roomy,1
12265,This is the perfect fallwinter sweater i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it werent sold out in my size love it,1
12266,These are such beautiful cheerful shorts the floral motif just makes me smile they do have brocade on them which is nice and dressy they are perfect for a night out or a day at the beach i went tts on them i purchased similar shorts last year in the brown color very nice shorts to have in your wardrobe,1
12267,Missed these last year in black so snatched them up when i saw them this season greatversatile wardrobe piece dress them up or down with kneehi boots booties or great heeled pump with silk blouse or sweater love something that i can wear so many ways and look and feel polished and put together,1
12268,I bought yellow one and im very happy with this purchase the flower print is beautiful and the material is light but not too thin i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottomim pretty short in height and size c i bought a m in regular size because i like my tops roomy and it fits really nice i just tie a small knot on the bottom of this top or tuck the shirt in a little bit it works perfect,1
12269,Beautiful dress that is well constructed the fabric is substantial and feels expensivei am and weigh bust waist and ordered the ml i usually wear a in dresses so i worried that it would be too big but it fit perfectly i am very happy with my purchase,1
12270,The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a petite i am and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered the length was not what made me send them back though the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick stretchy and well made however the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great,0
12271,I am pearshaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right these did the trick they are slim in the waist but have plenty of room for bigger hips the overall fit is body skimminghugging but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way and i have no gapping at the waist the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch but they will be a perfect pant for the office for reference i am and i got a regular,1
12272,I love this skirt i have it in black and when i saw this color i was so excited to add another one to my wardrobe these skirts are made well its not flimsy at a all the actually color is more of a light aqua blue so if you are wanting a baby blue might not be for you,1
12273,I tried this top on in the store before i ordered it online im a size varies and i ordered it in a size ive been searching the perfect fitted white buttondown blouse for weeks and i love this top its figure flattering true to size and a cute classy alternative to your basic white button down i cant wait to wear it,1
12274,This is a gorgeous piece of clothing true to size simple yet flattering lines very comfortable it has such flattering little touches as well such as the detail work on the sleeves love it love it love it i just wish it were machine washable,1
12275,I have been needing a perfect goto white tee for layering purposes and this one met and exceeded my expectations its the perfect weight for yearround use love that its sleeves again great for year round and the slight front v adds a nice special touch fell in love with the first one i bought online so ordered a second for backup its a winner and great price,1
12276,I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by its color and print it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats i liked the funky quality this added the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it i bought the necklace too i often wear a small but go,1
12277,Surprisingly flattering and so very soft and comfortable have had many compliments on this super cute paired with skinny jeans and boots also purchased the ausaria infinity scarf in navy which contrasts nicely with this top and a plusno signs of pilling yet,1
12278,I really wanted to like this top just got it in mail today but unfortunately it did not work well for me because im ft tall and the blouse was too short i like the look and how it feels and i havent completely decided whether to return it but here are the issues i have encountered with this top the blouse is very pretty and has a nice refreshing style with good print and color very soft too unusual for rayon of this type feels more like thin delicate cotton i got my top in red size,0
12279,Really cute piece but its huge i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering returning,0
12280,Great fit even for busty women ordered an because i usually need the room in the chest area on dressesddd fit nicely without being tight might have been able to size down but i didnt want to risk being too tight flattering especially on curves nice for contemporary office or special occasion if you like his designs you wont be disappointed,1
12281,Very comfortable and versatile got lots of compliments,1
12282,Im not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange for one thing the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag also the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss,0
12283,Maeve consistently nails pencil skirts i always know exactly what fabric and fit to expect and it is flawless the fabric is soft lined and has stretch it feels as close to wearing sweats as you can in a skirt the colors are beautiful on this id say in person the colors are a bit deeper and richer than they show in the model photo length is about the same on me as it is on the model at and got my usual s with no issue this beauty will go with lots of different colored tops too,1
12284,I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews although it did fit i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms i returned for a medium my usual size and it was perfect it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics i love love love that it is longsleeved and has pockets i went ahead and ordered the other print as well i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments highly recommend,1
12285,As a teacher its so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful that i can wear to work as well as on the weekends,1
12286,Superb quality and design i am a d and lbs i am a size to but mostly due to my hips and top i am pear shaped and the dress was a little loose but i just need to get it a little fitted but you can hardly tell i love the floral patterned so intricate it truly looks like a princess dress it is little heavy and at least its not too tight for dancing,1
12287,Love these sateen jeans they are a bit more polished than regular flat black jeans but not too shiny i am and always wear a in ag jeans and these were consistent with my usual size and fit perfectly the midrise is very comfortable and the length on me is about the same as on the model hits above my ankles theyre easy to dress up or down and i have a feeling ill be getting a lot of use out of them,1
12288,I got this in navy and love it the overall shape is sleek and classic body skimming but not tight with subtle detail in the knit design that make it entirely unique the quality and weight of the cashmere is perfect not to heavy or light xs fit perfect on my petite frame but busty or longertorsoed people may find the length a bit short it hits me right at the top of regular lowrise jeans this may be my favorite retailer buy of the season,1
12289,I bought these cords in another color last year and they are my favorite pants they are so comfy and keep their shape very well when i saw they were back i had to buy another pair i purchased navy and the color is beautiful,1
12290,I love these pants so comfortable and the material is so soft,1
12291,I never leave reviews for anything but this dress was such a complete miss first off its about sizes too big second off its knitted with a metallic thread that you cant really notice in the picture im usually a medium and feel an xs would be sufficient,0
12292,This romper fit like a dream it is gorgeous unique and sexy i am rating this stars because it took me minutes to try it on there is no zipper and the only way to get it on and off is by buttoning and unbuttoning the small buttons on the top nobodys got time for that i wanted so desperately to wear it to my friends th birthday party but i imagined myself spending half the night in the restroom trying to get this romper on and off no thank you i considered buying the romp,0
12293,I typically wear a small or xsmall in most brands from retailer but decided to order a small and medium in this dress since its a nonstretchy fabric im glad i did because the medium was a good fit and the small would have been very snug so i would agree with the previous reviewer and say that this dress runs at least a size small otherwise i really like the fit the fabric,1
12294,This is an adorable top i purchased both the green and the blue the colors and look are so much nicer than the photos of it this is a stock up item,1
12295,I adore this skirt it is so soft and flowy i was not sure if the mesh would be a bit stiff but its not at all the dots are soft as is the main fabric i could wear this all day long and be very comfy the underlying fabric is a bit more taupe than gold in color i am between sizes to i sized up and was glad i did no pinch at the waist i love that its feminine yet funky and could be worn formally or in fun it is midilength as you see on the model absolutely a great buy,1
12296,Great swim top good coverage and very comfortable be advised this is not reversible like title suggests,1
12297,Absolutely amazing a must staple in every ones closet this season i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed lookfeel the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on,1
12298,Got this in the black when i was in greenville nc i had seen it online for a little while and didnt think much of it until i tried it on in the store its surprisingly comfortable and it isnt too heavy its the perfect staple black shirt in my closet it is also very forgiving,1
12299,Loved this online but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky,0
12300,I tried on te regualr size xs as that is all they have in my store and decided to get them anyway even if a little long on me why because htey are so cute rolled up with the yellow color showingsuper comfortable have not washed htem yet but hipefully they remain a decent wuality,1
12301,Im lbs and ordered an xs petite i have other dresses from maeve in xs petite and xxs petite that fit really well but this one was weirdly big at the top,0
12302,I bought these about a month ago in the sky blue gorgeous color i was a little disappointed because they fit bigger than i normally wear my pants but i decided to keep them anyway they are the most comfortable pants ive ever worn butter soft i have dressed them up with a nice top and suede booties and also worn casual with a baggy sweater and toms i highly recommend these pants,1
12303,Very cute very flattering the peplum is fairly subtle and really works falling at just the right place for me im i got the red and have worn it over a dress and with jeans the color is deep and works well with my pale skin the fabric is quality and looks like it will hold up well over time always an issue with sweatersunlike some of the other reviewers i found it ran slightly large i am small framed but largechested and often take a medium in sweaters but a small is roomy o,1
12304,Very comfortable and super cute the top sold out which im bummed about but matched it with a funky black top,1
12305,I cannot say enough about these chinos i hope retailer will keep them around for a long time despite the news that says retailer is going the way of jcrew these pants are more stylish and comfortable than any other chinos i have owned i am a teacher and being comfortable and stylish at the same time is important i am a to and a fits me fine please please retailer keep making these every season in fun colors,1
12306,Love this i am and the medium fits like a dress not a tunic i opted for the medium because i didnt want the fit to be tight it is thin so youll need a slip,1
12307,So versatilei tried this on in my usual regular but it was way too long at the shoulders large in the busti am b and a tad too long overall i ordered the p and it fits perfectly can wear this year round and looks great with or without a belt pockets would have made it even better but still love it,1
12308,I dont know how to explain but this dress at least for me did not look like the model first off the dress is extremely heavy and extremely long and then where the fur starts for me it didnt start at the right spot so it was very awkward looking so definitely not for my type of body i am normal height athletic and curvy body but maybe for a very tall person looks good the material is very interesting its so soft,0
12309,This is a pretty sweater i ordered the red and it is a plum color not close to red but it will work well with black gray and denim i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular it is very well made no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel this will be nice for casual holiday dressing i found a longer tank in white works well under this,1
12310,I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections wish it came in more colors,1
12311,Was enchanted by this dress from the moment i saw it online i was able to find it at my local retailer,1
12312,I waited to review as i ordered both colors and multiple sizes for comparisonivory is actually truly longer than the black i wasnt sure from the photos on line but having tried both on ivory is longer as shown onlinetrue to sizebigger i am never sure if i should write true to size or big but went with the xs petite used to do everything in xs at lbs dd chest in waistt ehre was room to move super comfortably petite for sure for me for both length at the kne,1
12313,This dress is to die for the picture doesnt do it justice so pretty and dainty perfect dress for a wedding,1
12314,Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate took my usual size four i am moderately short waisted,1
12315,I love this dress i typically do not like or wear dresses often and definitely not this style im glad i tried something different i received numerous compliments on how flattering and attractive it is yes the belt is only in the front but i cinched it very tight and it pulled the back in i bought size s it was very form fitting in the top and waist and not too big through the hips i have a bust and i can button all the top without pulling i wore it with black tights and high brow,1
12316,Ive been looking for the perfect white eyelet maxi feels like a perfect summer staplebut sadly this was not it quality isnt great which is surprise on a price tag top of dress is lined but cheaply so its somewhat see through the dress was returned,0
12317,I loved this dress i am ft tall and usually wear xs this dress i would definitely need an xxs in i like things not too tight but this was too roomy so the style was lost it was a little long but i think that is because it kind of hung on me the material is light but substantial it has a lot of stretch to it which is very nice it has a silky feel could be worn dressy or every day a very good dress all around waiting for the xxs to come in i would definitely recommend it,1
12318,I ordered the xl and it fits me the same as pictured on the model so its true to size the peplum is very comfortable i love the mix of colors especially for fall ive always had great luck with the fit wear of this brand id love to see this same style done in lighter colors for summer,1
12319,This sweater is a great oversized warm and very soft cozy winter treasure it is very comfortable to wear and looks cute on i really believe it would be flattering on almost anyone i highly recommend it especially now that it is on sale,1
12320,I am pleased with this modal cowl neck top it is a very basic but is a nice addition to my wardrobe the cowl is just rightnot overly chunky or awkward it drapes nicely and lies flat against my chest this blouse softens the facejust what i was looking fori needed a softlooking black tee to go with a skirt i have and wanted a bit more than a basic tee but nothing overly frilly or ruffled this blouse filled the bill quite nicely it is a very soft modal fabric and fits tts i am,1
12321,I just wore these and they were comfortable and didnt stretch our or become baggy throughout the day i have three kids and am constantly moving theyre a nice in between weight and held up nicely i have some from jcrew that stretch out and become baggy in the knees and backside and these didnt do that i usually wear an and i purchased a medium and they fit well i would say that run a little big though,1
12322,I wasnt looking for a little black dress but i couldnt resist this one its as stunning in person as it is in the pictures online the front has a corsetlike closure which i didnt realize until it arrived its very classy though not cheap looking the lace detail is really beautiful i was a bit concerned about how the sheer looking areas would look because i was hoping to wear the dress for a dressy work function its definitely a sexy dress but the fact that theres so much coverage ma,1
12323,I really wanted to like this top in person though the fit was too large and boxy i did order a smaller size based on other reviews but it was still too sacklike i got the grey motif pattern which i thought was quite pretty and interesting the material was nice and lightweight perhaps it would look better on someone with a straight figure and small bust,0
12324,I generally love pilcro pants and these are no exception the fabric is heavy but soft the color is so vivid but still easy to mix with other top combinations they are comfortable and flattering i am and these are not crops on me with the rolled up hem they are a perfect full length pant but that works well for me,1
12325,This shirt fits very true to size with very soft and comfortable material that hangs just right wears well and is versatile for many occasions please come out with more colors so i can purchase them as well,1
12326,I had this in my cart for ages waiting for a sale and debating the dress in general i am delighted as it did finally go on sale i bought it and it is fabulous my measurements are i wear a d bra and the small fit perfectly the only problem i have had with it is that the lining in the front shows about at the bottom of the dress once i have worn the dress what seems to happen is that the dress creeps up due to its wrinkling but the lining does not hence the showing i,1
12327,I agree with the other reviewers that this runs big unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back i love the lyocell material i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it doesnt look right it is not as pictured as well the skirt i received is a medium blue denim not the lovely light blue as pictured another reason why i am returning,0
12328,I just received the pink in the mail i am and around i ordered the size they fit perfectly they are a very straight leg with a snug fit you can adjust the cuff to whatever length you need or unroll them completely the fabric is of beautiful quality i basically never wear corduroy because it can add pounds not so with this pair of pants i am thinking about another color,1
12329,Love this length print and material have already worn times and wears and washes well sleeves are short than pic shows but i dont mind,1
12330,This dress is beautiful i love the collar and tie neck detail i decided to order up a size and am very glad i did i normally wear a or petite and ordered this in a petite it fits perfect with a little roomnot snug at all which i like the description says its a slimmer fit so im happy i ordered the size i did im excited to wear it and add it to my wardrobe,1
12331,So let me start by saying i love nonskinny cut jeans im a curvy athletic type with thick legs so when a jeans comes around with a generous fit im thrilled these jeans are generously cut through the hips and waist giving it a boyfriend type of cut the denim is soft like your old favorite pair of jeans that have been washed times i did size down one size and probably could have gone down one more size but i still want a bit of a looser cut pilcro denim always has stretch in the,1
12332,This is the most fabulous sweater ever i really hesitated spending for a sweater but this sweater is worth every dime it is soft and luxurious i tried it over a cashmere cable knit dress and it looks unbelievable i also tried it over jeans and it looks equally as good if it came in another color id buy it too,1
12333,Love this dress sooo comfortable and flattering i typically wear a in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut i went with xs on this dress and its still very comfortable and loose fitting the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt,1
12334,This dress was really odd i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but thats about it the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large i was just very underwhelmed with this dress also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution overall its okay just hated it on me,0
12335,I love this top i also have it in blue i wish it came in more colors prints i would definitely buy it,1
12336,This pullover blouse is a real winner it is soft and figure flattering but not too clingy the neck looks good open or closed with the small button all in all its just a very good design note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional the holes disappear without being visible into the sleeve when they are not being used also the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used so there is no extra length in the sleeves as may be suggested in the photo,1
12337,Im very pleased with my purchase of this dress it is perfect for dancing or a springsummer wedding or doing out it is very flattering on my rather straightslenderpetite frame i ordered a size and it was tts if it only had pockets it would be absolutely perfect,1
12338,Super cute well made great embroidery waist runs big,1
12339,I like the top like the tie in the front the material is stretchy would imagine this will work for any size of chest i wear either a small or medium so thought id be safe order the medium which turned out to fix more like a large im taking it back for the smallas its a keeper,1
12340,After multiple purchase and returns from other sites i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation located beach side this dress was better than i could have hoped the fit is very flattering loose tight in all the right places the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather the slight train back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise casual floral pattern i would highly recommend,1
12341,This is an adorable top sweet back detail thin material but soft the top is two sizes too big im normally a large and a small fits i know it is supposed to be baggy but the large was inches too big under each arm size down and petite ladies will be sized out love this though,1
12342,These pants fit true to size i have a small waist and curvy hips and while i have always loved the low rise ag stevie these offer more coverage at the back with the same great slim fit through the leg the length is also great for those of us who are not super tall the have some stretch but i wore them several times without washing and the never got baggy in the knees or other stretch points i own two other pairs of ag stevie in traditional denim and they still look great after years of wea,1
12343,This shirt is just so easy breezy i got the blue motif and love the pattern the top is loose but its supposed to fit that way i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer im about lbs and ordered a small,1
12344,I loved the dress but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed very easy order and return thanks,0
12345,I love love love this cardigan i ordered it in plum regular small as they were out of petite small my preferred size i was very impressed with the quality of the cardigan the details like the sheer fabric around the neckline are very delicate and beautiful the waist line sits exactly where it should i was worried it would sit too low as i am short and did not get this in petite sizing so maybe i should say this cardigan runs small i think i have found the perfect cardigan it goes wi,1
12346,I find it very difficult to find office friendly yet unique designs and feel this one fits the bill and also has the ability to be dressed up for the evening i am curvy on bottom so i sized up from my normal retailer to a and surprisingly the dress fit my hips just fine im about if it helps as i know its hard to determine sometimes if this style will fit a more curvy figuremy advice is to go up a size if you are the fabric i found true to the photo and the emerald i,1
12347,This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away i am a size petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit if anything i might have to size down i purchased a petite in this dress and i couldnt zip it all the way up it was as if i was trying to get into a petite i dont even think a size would fit there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received even if the fit was perfect i didnt,0
12348,I love this tee it has a very flattering fit and the fabric is very soft it runs small especially in the arms i suggest sizing up the tee looks great on it is slimming and super comfortable,1
12349,I knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy but this is huge i wear a l or xl at retailer and i got the ml and was swimming in this top sadly this will be going back,0
12350,This blouse is a great combination of silky and professional in the front and more casual tshirt like in the back the ruffle lies nicely and its very feminine i got the light blue color and cant wait for the weather to be warm enough to wear this to work,1
12351,This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos very romantic and fun,1
12352,I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews cute design but not as comfy as it looks returned immediately,0
12353,As soon as i saw this dress online i knew i wanted it i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neckshoulders i ordered online and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress i am and it hits just an inch above my knee its the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event,1
12354,Im in relatively decent shape lbs and size is perfect i went for the regular rather than petite sizing which came well below my knees and although i would usually have a sheath dress like this hemmed up to that slim part right at the bottom of the knee the slim silhouette shape served to lengthen the profile as a longer dress so i left it about below the knee the stretch allows it to hug the body and with the right undergarments it is super comfortable and attractive go,1
12355,Love these bottoms cheekier than i thought but like them even more,1
12356,I love this tee i bought the teal in store rich colors little details are perfect the loose got was very flattering on me im not busty at all and it hung so well wore it to brunch and the flight home later,1
12357,When im looking for something comfortable to wear that looks effortless and cool this is the top i pick i ended up buying it in navy too its really soft ur washes well and its great quality a must have,1
12358,I ordered the red in xl and the fit on me matches the photos on the model its true to size the quality of the material is fantastic the stitched upper portion is welldone the color is much prettier in person its such a bright cheerful wellmade top i washed mine and air dried it fits looks great after washing this is a bargain especially on sale the red combo is such a unique mix of colors i like using blue jewelry with it but also mint green jewelry too,1
12359,There isnt anything i dont love about this dress get it before its gone i get compliments every time i wear this dress,1
12360,I saw this dress in the lilac at the store and loved it immediately the picture on the website does not do it justice,1
12361,Great shirt love the detail in back feminine and different than the average t,1
12362,Could not wait to try this on when it arrived jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering not the case here i usually wear a size but i decided to order a size down for a size i am and lb being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right the pockets make it casual and cute while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic you will love,1
12363,I got a small mauve the fit is great and the length is perfect for me just few inches above my kneescute and cozy what more can i aske for,1
12364,Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots i am a ml on top and a sm on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body there are some problems but workable slip is sewnin which i wish was detachable the scoop neck is too low for my ddd bust weave,1
12365,One cant tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent it also is very long almost dress length feels less quality than what retailer usually carries,0
12366,I love these bottoms great colors i also love the feel of the bottoms very soft high quality,1
12367,I absolutely adore this cardigan its very feminine stylish and comfortable and the gold color is gorgeous i received numerous compliments when i wore it to work the first time its the perfect weight for transitional weather or chilly offices,1
12368,I did the happy dance when the dress arrived but the very sad dance when i tried it on unfortunately instead of following my instincts i took the review here and reviews from some other sites to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual huge mistake as in this dress was huge much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design for reference im lbs c i usually wear an dress due to a very large rib cage i ordered the but was literally swimming i think a woul,1
12369,Ive never had a problem with pilcro jeans i own several pairs however i ordered my regular size im pounds and not only were these jeans thin they had zero stretch and after hour of wear stretched out horribly they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean,0
12370,Had been eyeing this for a while print is beautiful in person just as pictured tts fit size pear shaped comes within a couple inches of my knees so long enough to wear to work,1
12371,I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist but this shirt doesnt have that problem i have the white one the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color i usually wear an in maeve blouses but this one i took a there is definately no give though i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else i am sad thou,1
12372,Love this ordered it on sale but i really do think its worth full price i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good tooim slender and about with full bust the small fits similar to the model and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves i have long arms and length i went with the small maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy its very well made and although youll need a cami i still feel as if it will be very cozy perfect for our mi,1
12373,I sized down to an xs based on reviews and the fit was perfect i am b and usually take a small i like the classic lines with the sexy edge this is a heavier sweater but perfect for our houston fall and winter if you size down the sweater has a much nicer fit to it and is not at all loose fitting it just skims your curves,1
12374,Finally a jumper that works for me i am but i have a long torso so most jumpers ride up in an uncomfortable way this one is perfect the material is light and perfect for warm weather the top is very adjustable for all different chest sizes i personally think the pant length looks better if you are under because it comes down closer to the ankle but then again if you have long thin legs you might not mind the bottom hitting at your calf i cant say enough good things about this jum,1
12375,They fit me great are super comfortable they are casual yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions i love them with booties i think they look better in person than online too,1
12376,This t is so pretty in person the gold is metallic with embroidered detail this is my first purchase of this brand so my usual size medium fit just fine i am excited to put this under one of my blazers for a casula friday it is quite unusual and great quality,1
12377,This dress looks beautiful on its very flattering and comfortable to wear it runs true to maeves dress sizing which for me means in these dresses i always get one size larger than what i normally wear on my height the regular was just above the knee great for giving you the illusion of the figure you want even if you dont have it naturally,1
12378,Pilcro has my heart their cut and style are perfect for me no more squeezing into skinny jeans dear retailer please always sell pilcro and maeve brands they are amazing,1
12379,I am in love with these bought the regular length last year and loved them despite the shortness hit right above the ankle that length looks good with ballet flats or tucked into boots this year i bought the burgundy and the teal in the long length i am and the long fit perfectly they come to the bottom of my ankle without extra fabric please restock the carbon in the long length i want to buy my th pair,1
12380,This is a terrific top the supima cotton is supersoft the black a deep black i love that antho is listening and that its made in the usa the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering i bought the medium and am a reliable size topmedium f the sleeves are nice and long dont miss out on this classic tee friends,1
12381,But it runs super small i wear a medium for everything but couldnt come close to buttoning this the buttons were about inches apart horizontallyprobably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing,0
12382,Love love love this top so flattering and forgiving bought it in white great for summer,1
12383,Beautiful dress and so delicately well made lb xxs petite or the smallest size possible worked for meit accentuates ones curvy body and covers up any excess skin in the belly area i could eat on freely at a formal occasion words just cannot describe how beautiful this dress is,1
12384,Love thesealthough im exchanging mine for a size larger they are definitely wide leg have plenty of length im and there is a good inch of extra length but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomachhip area though but thought it was worth mentioning im pretty curvey probably a size in jeans right now and exchanged a l for a xl great quality,1
12385,I absolutely love these pants they are so incredibly comfortable and fit is amazing they look awesome with sandals and boots and will transition perfectly into fall i definitely recommend sizing down like the other reviewers have suggested i originally purchased my normal size but they were loose after wearing a little around the house i decided to exchange them for a and they were a little snug at first but stretched out and fit perfect,1
12386,This dress is so cute and comfy i purchased it for my friends wedding brunch celebration perfect transitional piece,1
12387,Love this print and fabric its soft and comfy with adjustable straps so pretty and feminine,1
12388,Wellthis is on me as i saw this hanging in the store but way off on my size which is xxs petitei looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for meboth pieces are transparent no opaque lining at all is inside both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials there is no flow just cling the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shapethis may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece at all bes,0
12389,I love this the contrast in much prettier in person,1
12390,This looked beautiful online but the skirt isnt silk the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels with most of them containing some level of polyester parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap overall very disappointing this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be onlinea definite return i wouldnt even recommend this at first or second cut,0
12391,Great turtleneck very comfortable and not tight around the neck at all the material is super soft and washes well i ended up getting all colors my only regret is that there are only colors i absolutely love this top i also like the many complements ive received while wearing them i am full figured and the fit is very flattering,1
12392,A lovely sweatshirt with mesh front and back cover with soucotache sp handwork with a touch of sequins for some pop the knit sleeves are thin but the top has some weight due to the detailing on the front and backthe fit is tts and as shown on the model it lays comfortable but its not really baggyreally lovely glad i bought one before it was sold out,1
12393,This top is extremely well done it looks classy and timeless i tried on the white version in store but chose to order the black as the white was too sheer,1
12394,I had been eyeing this coat for a few weeks after it appeared in the email and i finally decided to purchase it to treat myself i was very excited to get it as it is a beautiful coat online however once i received it i was very disappointed the material is much thinner than i would expect for something that cost and when i went to button it the button slipped right off the thread it was sewn onto the coat with i checked the other buttons and all of them were loose as well perso,0
12395,This skirt is perfect it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new years eve and had many compliments it runs a tad big i am about lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway my new favorite,1
12396,Very flattering not too short beautiful im d usually wear m in dresses wide hips the fit very nicely,1
12397,This shirt is everything i wanted it to be lightweight easy style without being shapeless it is sheer but perfect with a tank underneath im an extra small and it fit perfectly not tight not too loosehonestly if it came in more colors id buy it in every one definitely going to be a fall staple,1
12398,I love pairing this skirt with edgy tops it plays so well with the detailing im usually a size but sized up to a so that it didnt pull other than that absolutely love it beautiful all over,1
12399,Love this dress the material has a softness to it just love it cant wait to wear it this summer fits true to size,1
12400,Loved these culottes flattering fit and nice drape the fabric though poly is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk the length just below knee length works for me too the color is lovely for the fall rich copper and easy to pair id say these are tts but if in doubt size down im between a size and the works best for me,1
12401,I loved these and wore them once i bought the red ones and the stained my furniture and my shirt so i washed them a few times in hopes of getting out all the extra dye ruined yet another chair so annoyed i loved them but they are not worth it,0
12402,I ordered this on sale in blue as i had missed it online i wore it this week during our heat spurt in cali and was shocked how incredible comfy and cute this was with my skinny jeans it was perfect for the warm day as well as the snapping evening meeting i had to attend on an outdoor patio i will love wearing this from spring into summer i do hope they bring it back as i would love the beige too,1
12403,I love this cozy and comfy top it is oversized as the name says and implies but i normally wear an xs in most retailer tops and i chose to get a small and im glad i did it is boxy and oversized but also short the small is perfect for me and it really feels so cozy as is and big enough to wear a tee or tank under it and not fee clingy,1
12404,Love these jeans they fit great they feel great i am pounds they fit everywhere you would like them to unroll them and they are long love love love so wonderful i just bought my second pair,1
12405,I just purchased this adorable unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it as soon as i saw it i knew i had to have it it is super soft tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are whats really so sweet on this one though im not a fan of snails in my garden ill make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea,1
12406,Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size the cut and shape are very flattering with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist in person the color looks very different than on the website it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat since this jumpsuit is so cute i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself,1
12407,I ordered this in black and loved it so much i ordered the red color too it hasnt arrived yet but im hoping its tan like it appears to be online it fits tts and lbs the xs fit perfectly and wasnt too long,1
12408,A cute top slightly tight in the upper area debated returning but decided to keep as the top is unique and i know that i will wear it frequently aleardy thinking of way to wear all year around runs small,1
12409,Do not buy these pants the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots and i followed the washing instructions i bought another pair and the same thing happened im out a bunch of money,0
12410,I ordered this in gray and in white these are not your mothers slips they are comfy and soft i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didnt want to go for full on tights or leggings i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress the gray may even be opaque enough to stand almost on its own very happy with these,1
12411,This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished it is not a cheap polyester fabric as one reviewer wrote it is a rayon and nylon blend it does wrinkle easily i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back i dont typically gravitate toward warm color palette but the burnt orange color is really lovely it can be dressed up or down very easily and it has pockets i typically wear xs in retailer brands and the size fit me well,1
12412,I ordered the yellowfloral version in size xl it fits me just as shown with the model so its true to size its very comfortable and made well the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too,1
12413,Im and pounds and got a medium the cut is very flattering on me and i have received many compliments when i wear it it is lined so no need to wear a cami underneath,1
12414,Bought the gray and peach in the store and loved it so much ordered the other colors online this top is very comfortable and stylish it stands out from the crowd as just enough different to be very unique and trendy but still a classic look the sweater front is very soft and the back has a bit of a silk feel but not sheer i also like that the back is a bit longer than the front,1
12415,I bought the black one on an extra off sale and i just love it not thrilled about the other colors but i might order another one just because i like it so much super soft and comfy i had to order a size up since the mediums were all sold out but i like the way it fits not too big at all,1
12416,Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my manback appearance cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem not clingy very soft fabric doesnt accentuate bulges so i am happy about its forgiving silhouette,1
12417,I walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on i am so glad she did this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets after assessing it further i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down i bought a small i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist i am ft lbs b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure for,1
12418,Love these pants they are a perfect color are of a good weight i sometimes worry that lightcolored pants are going to be see through and fit wonderfully they are true to size and are narrow down the leg perfect for flats boots booties or sandals for summer,1
12419,I was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line i fell in love immediately and didnt think twice about paying full price i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green which gives it extra character very well made i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings but they are very secure i ordered my usual xl and found it roomy enough in the bust and arms i would definitely call it tru,1
12420,Im petite but even if i werent i think this runs very large isnt form flattering at all and overall looks dull it most definitely does not justify the price material is thin,0
12421,This shirt was very cute i ordered it as something to be able to wear to class with leggings and it is perfect the colors are great and the length is very nice it will be a nice piece to layer with a jacket for the the fall,1
12422,I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasnt going to be delivered on time im so happy that i bought this dress its so comfortable and easy to wear i got lots of compliments on itit runs very large though i ended up with a size i initially tried on the as i have a larger chest the still had plenty of room,1
12423,I ordered the size xl and it fits me as it does on the model its true to size it is made of a scratchier material but is still comfortable to wear definitely needs a tankcami underneath i love the vintage look its worn well washed well too id love to see more versions in this same style ill get good use out of this in the summer and then will layer cardigans over it in the fall,1
12424,These jeans i am obsessed the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy relaxed feel i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these do yourself a favor and buy them,1
12425,I pretty much love any sweater by moth this one is no exception soft lofty and a pretty shade i bought in pink this will be a cold weather staple,1
12426,Love these jeans comfortable fit and material is soft fit true to size and have a good rise,1
12427,This is the perfect bralette for comfort its soft and fits to form really quickly i wear a b cup and its enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise now at months pregnant its pretty much perfect to sleep in too im at band and im still wearing it on the loosest closure but it fits perfectly there for me,1
12428,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images it is very thin as others have said the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs structured it is more similar to a cape or shawl design if youre looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design this is not it i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design,0
12429,I purchased this for my something daughter it is so complimentary and cute and stylish,1
12430,I cannot begin to tell you how much i love these jeans i have been searching everywhere for the right pair of black jeans and this is it they run a little small and dont have as much give as regular pilcro jeans i am normally a in pilcro and i purchased these in a the fit is wonderful and they keep their shape beautifully,1
12431,Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store i an in between smallmedium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps great with jeans pencil skirts and capris,1
12432,Very versatile dress runs a bit large i am foot lbs and ordered the xs petite and it fit perfectly,1
12433,I love how the white and beige were not see through and actually very forgiving to people with cellulite love love the fit highly recommend im always a but in these i even fit into the i would say if youre in between size down i love the fit so much that i got the beige and white highly recommend hit at my ankle for me at,1
12434,I love this shirt bought it at the store i have a few shirts from this brand so i knew how it would fit i love the colors in this short its very spring and light weight love it very much,1
12435,Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo when i pulled it out of the package i thought id ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly with beautiful detail and high quality material but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion it doesnt look anything like the phot,0
12436,I was so excited for this to arrive at the end of last summer my favorite shirt you know the kind dresses up or down with ease its your go to for work or a night out with friends was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement i thought that this would be a good contender but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bagfirstly the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph in person its more of a peachy offwhte instead of white still pr,0
12437,This blouse is a disappointment it runs so large it looks ridiculous the cute is super wide and flared they must have it pinned on the model it is not flattering at all i really thought this could be cute not worth the money either its expensive and illfitting for reference i am and lbs and wear a or,0
12438,In love with this dress so feminine and lovely makes you feel beautiful the fabric flow and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering i am ftin and lbsbought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area however the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me cannot wait to wear this dress but it is so long needs to be altered itll be worth it,1
12439,I just got it in the mail and i love it very versatile piece wear with skinny jeans and heels or tucked into a skirt i usually wear a size small but went with what the other review said about a small being tailored and got the medium so i could tuck the front into jeans i am lbs a dd and wear a size or in jeans,1
12440,I love this top i actually didnt read the reviews prior and ordered a small the retailer tag on mine says small but the tag in the shirt is xs it does run large so the mixup was fine by me the style of the shirt is meant to be loose and light i love it,1
12441,I went out on a limb ordering this romper its not really in my wheelhouse the whole romper thing but it was a home run i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldnt pull it off but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well as far as fit im lbs and ordered a size i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there but i didnt have any trouble with that i just took,1
12442,Love this blouse it fits tts and it accentuates all the right curves the color is a lovely shade of pale peach and while its true that some of the buttons arent cut its an easy fix you just have to take a small pair of sharp scissors and carefully cut the uncut threadsit didnt even take me minutes to do then you can button or unbutton in whatever way feels comfortable for you it just makes you look and feel effortlessly sophisticated busty girls dont be shyi have a h bus,1
12443,I love retailer clothes but ive often ordered shirts in an xs that i really needed an xs petite in because of the length and fit through the bust but they didnt have any petites in the size i needed im at pounds i got this shirt in xs not petite and am thrilled with the fit the material is formfitting enough to look like a petite and it doesnt drop below my waist line im thrilled with my purchase,1
12444,Very fun shirt is see through beyond lace so need to wear black tank or black bra very comfy flirty and feminine tts flowy fit like on model,1
12445,I bought the sweater in nude and it fits perfectly it is so much better than a standard cardigan it has beautiful details its drapes so well across your body and it longer in the front than the back which makes it hang beautifully i wear this to work but would definitely wear this on the weekends for more casual outfits its very versatile,1
12446,The fabric is incredibly soft and has a good weight to it this is also pretty warm its not a down jacket but its as least as warm as a sweatshirt it fits close to the body in typical bomber jacket fashion im lbs and went with the large which fits well i always find myself wishing bomber jackets were just a tad longer and this is no exception but i cant really fault the jacket for that its true to the style,1
12447,I love this tank basic but super sexy im an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so ill take it i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small im torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt,1
12448,These are my first pair of mother denim and certainly not the last they fit true to size i am a in designer denim such as j brand paige ag i bought these in a size and they fit perfectly they hug my curves nicely i am so they bunch up just a little bit at the ankles which i can easily have altered but honestly dont need it the quality is great nice denim material with a lot of stretch to it i love my skinny jeans tight and these were exactly what i was looking for,1
12449,I tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger but its basically cut for modelsized people only its short and wide and if you have any boobs at all itll make the back pucker i cant imagine this will look good on most women,0
12450,I waited three months for these pants when they finally arrived i was mostly pleased they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about and they should have beenproblem one they bag out i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry regained shape thenproblem two the crotch split in the front im a teacher i sincerely hope no one noticed i read other reviews about this problem and dont know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other,0
12451,This jacket is phenomenal the color is gorgeous in person the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special its also very warm and comfortable like some other reviewers said it looked great zipped as well as unzipped this is a really special find and great addition if youre considering this jacket i say go for it for reference i actually love the fit and thought it was tts though i am a c and got this in a small so perhaps thats only the case for c cup a,1

12453,This is such a cute vest nice and cozy so cute paired with a long sleeve tee statement necklace jeans and booties very happy with my purchase,1
12454,Impecable workmanship overseas i usually wear a petite but ordered this in a regular size and glad that i did since it curves up on this side it barely overs the waistband on my jeans ordered this in pink but its more of pale coral pink the style is more of a semihalter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra its a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather,1
12455,I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee in two colors no less i was very thrilled especially since it was during the mothers day promotion on all items based on the models photos the top looks flattering with a swing type style i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top when the package was delivered i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant the tops are so wide not like the webs,0

12464,I love these jeans theyre incredibly soft super comfortable and hold their shape i can wear them for hours on end and i dont get that droopy snagging look jeans can get when they stretch out fit i am normally a depending on the jean i took these in the i usually have a difficult time finding skinny jeans that fit my legs and dont fall off my waist these have enough give to accommodate my larger legs but the material holds well so i dont need a belt to keep them up,1

12470,I love the style and the flow of this shirt definitely worth the purchase and very flattering,1
12471,This dress is stunning my sisterinlaw was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes it fit beautifully on my frame unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles it made the shorter girls look shorter i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now,1
12472,This sweater is gorgeous i wish i could have purchased in several colors because its now a staple in my closet downside it does say delicate cold water wash but the lace on the back is so delicate and pulling happens on the sides every time i wear it so dry cleaning is the way to go the sweater does snag easily so dont wear anything that could get caught in it jewelryhandbags with chains or embellishments because they will catch,1
12473,I love this to throw over leggings covers your butt great fabric and quality i bought white and gray after they arrived i knew i needed a black one but sadly it doesnt come in black i ordered xs and its roomy size down for sure,1

12477,This jumpsuit is a classic i read the reviews where some were complaining about the buttons i did not have these issues maybe because i have short fingernails i like this jumpsuit because the style of it will be around for a long time you can dress the jumpsuit up or down i rarely pay full price but this jumpsuit is so greatfantastic that i did not mind doing so i strongly recommend this jumpsuit,1
12478,Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didnt bother lining the skirt portion grrrrrrrrrrrmy stats are a and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half so i would say its running bigthe straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear tooim and it came to just below my knees,1
12479,These jeans are awesome as most of the reviewers have already noted they are tastefully aged to look modern but not so ripped that i look sloppy they fit true to size with retailers recent sizing i used to wear a size but in the last couple of years i have had to move down to a size even though i am still the same size and weight anyway i bought these in a size and they are perfect i have not worn them all day yet so i cannot comment on whether they stretch out after wea,1

12481,I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it and while it is lovely well made and very pretty and delicatei just didnt feel like it was anything special if you dont have a blouse like this then it is a great find but it is nothing super out of the ordinary fit i feel is ttsi am in between a m and li ordered the l lots of room in the body although i didnt like where the arms hit on me they arent wrist length but they arent midfore,1
12482,I really love this laceup shirt but i only liked it in black on me i like it open like the model is wearing it but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a waysand i felt like i was revealing a little too much i would likely wear it open but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable i absolutely love the whole outfit aspictured and also reviewed the polka dot pants i wish the laces were a little longer than they areif you have i,1
12483,I love this with skinny jeans it is comfortable and soft it fits well,1
12484,I thought this was adorable on the model but not so much on me i actually didnt mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan but i didnt want to keep it for look the material felt inexpensive the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself im and about lbs,0
12485,This sweater is super cute it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold mintteal and greydark gray,1
12486,Classic retailer stunning dress the embroidery is beautiful with the beads and details the blush color can be difficult with my pale complexion but i didnt have trouble with this i got a ton of compliments it looks a bit flat on top on the model im not very curvy and it accentuates my curves nicely it doesnt hang down quite so much as it looks in the picture but has a more classic fit and flare shape very flattering,1
12487,I usually buy a pair of these kind of pants every year from this brand they are lightweight sturdy and very flattering to my curvier body this brand can run big so i usually buy a size rather than my normal size i was going to wait it out and let someone else try them first but then i caved and ordered them in two sizes and because they didnt label them etc anymore these pants still look well made and have cute little details but they are bigger than ever the s,0
12488,When i saw this in store i was so attracted to the colors on the v neck and actually thought it was a dress until i tried it on i was confused about the very high side slits then i figured it was a tunic ive always hatedavoided tunics because i thought they would widen my thighs and give me a bad shape they actually made me look straighterslimmer which looked amazing the more i had it on the more i fell in love with it and didnt want to take it off i can wear it in the winter and f,1
12489,Oh my this dress is so cute it fits me exactly like the pictures i usually wear a or and ordered a medium i maybe could have worn a small as well though there is a lot of fabric to this dress so if youre under it might overwhelm you im and the medium was barely sleepy the floor in a low heel this is s dress you can dress up or down i also appreciated the neckline not being too revealing and pockets that was a nice surprise the fabric is a little thicker so its no,1
12490,This is a very well made top i love everything about this top bought it in both colors i think its fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it,1
12491,I am not sure who would look good in this dress it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone,0
12492,This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color it looked as if id washed it in filthy water its a very dingy white needless to say it went back,0
12493,This blouse is made out of a highquality material flows beautifully and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellowgreen base pop i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy for the reference size was the best fit form my curvy dd frame,1
12494,This shirt was a cute print but it was too boxy and hit too short on the thigh i considered having it taken in the waist but ultimately decided it wasnt worth paying the extra on top of the,0
12495,If i had to describe on two words that would be it the material is not a stiff nogive material nbut rahter a soft stretchy material with some depth the design has grooves not sure how to explain it if you are short i would definitely go with petite though it was a little too long on regular size and hit in the wrong spot on my calves very flattering and nice cut i dindt order yet as it is new and i jsut bought a few dresses but in my basket forh te next sale if they s,1
12496,This dress is so much better in person than pictures details on the sleeves and buttons on the front shows quality and makes it an original looking dress ive wore it yesterday for the first time and received compliments buy before it sells out,1
12497,I was a little nervous to buy these because they are such a statement piece but i love them they are so comfortable which is rare for jeans they create the optical illusion that i am a super model so i will wear them as often as possible very flattering and comfywin win,1
12498,Adorable skirt thought it would be snug so ordered up but had to send back and reorder in normal size fits perfect found it to be slimming on the backside yay this will be a wardrobe staple for many years to come,1
12499,The skirt is just okay the design is great but the material is extremely thin and see through there is a slip which goes to midthigh very strange and felt weird as well the pleats are okay but not great overall it is not worth paying full price for or anywhere near that and again be wary of it being see through,0
12500,I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans and this is pretty perfect it is more sheer than i would like but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer ill overlook that the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different,1
12501,Such a cute skirt it has a touch of whimsy with this tropical flare that makes me feel pretty it fits well and it is true to size,1
12502,Spied this dress in my local retailer and figured i would try it on for overall fit before ordering the petite on line for some reason retailer has eliminated instore petite items so disappointing i was pleasantly surprised the xs regular fit well and was soon in my checkout pile the dress is very soft although i suspect it will wrinkle when packed in a suitcase the color blocking is great and makes this dress so versatile for spring summer and fall the xs regular fit my lb,1
12503,Very much in love with this ethereal delicate dress the silk is very light and slightly clingy so take caution when wearing the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down otherwise tts for reference i am dd,1
12504,I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mothers day weekend insta posts by retailer stores i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me as its pretty straight up and down and i wasnt sure the waist would hit at the right place because im super high waisted and this didnt appear to be so in truth it isnt and ill be tying the ribbon or wearing a slim belt at a higher point than where was originally intended however what struck me was the ability,1
12505,Beautiful pajama bottoms i purchased these as a special treat for myself luckily i found a review on another site stating that these run small before pirchasing no one wants tight pjs order a size up also im tall and the length is just right if you are taller you may find this style too short i havent ordered the top because im not sure of the fit but im guessing it also runs small based on the photo,1
12506,After a long wait for this dress to come in i finally received it the wait was worth itthe colors and pattern are just like they are online the length comes right to to the top of my kneesi am a couple of things to note the sleeves are narrow if you have skinny arms no problem the fit across the bust is snug enough that if you have a large bust there will probably be a gap at the buttons there are gathers at the shoulder giving the sleeve a slight puffed shoulder if you,1
12507,Theres a stretch and a swing to the dress that makes you feel light and free really sexy as pictured with boots and scarf,1
12508,This top is amazing i thought it looked really cute in the photos but its even cuter online the material is great and you cant go wrong with the fit i love tops that are loose and flowy so when im feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops this one is definitely a must,1

12512,Even though this shirt is incredibly thin i love that i can wear it multiple ways throughout the year it can be used as a swimsuit coverup with white jeans in the summer over skinny jeans and with a sweater in the fallwinter this is a great piece to own,1
12513,I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is they werent exaggerating the small was way too big for me and the xxs and xs are already sold out beware that you will have to size down at least sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured it is going back for me,0
12514,Wow bailey knocks it out of the park with this sensual iamwomanhearmepurr bodyslimming dress we all have our hang ups this dress forces you to see all the beauty that everyone else sees the rouching covers up any dimpling or rolls you think you have the body conscious structure lets you see those curves you knew existed but deny yourself from loving oh you hate your arms me too guess what you dont even notice them because youre so focused on how amazing you look the cut,1

12516,This dress is perfect and so sweet i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about to one size large i run anywhere from in retailer dresses and i ordered the if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger dd chest because of the wellconstructed bodice length is nice for us tall girls as well,1

12522,Great color soft fabric but waaaaay too long more like a night shirt than a tshirt,0
12523,Love this tank the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow ive worn this to yoga and to teach barre and cardio dance and its a hit as a lifelong dancer this was a must have my only negative is since the sizing is either xss or ml it may run too big or too small for some i tyically wear a m or in retailer tops and this is a little large in ml however not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like highly recommend,1
12524,This skirt looks cute online but it has several issues the slit is very high this photo is deceptive look closelythe slit is actually to her finger tips you cant wear any kind of spanx or control top tights slits on both sides so when you walk they fly away the micro mini slip bunches the fine knit is very snagable the skirt is very long it is going back,0
12525,I bought this dress at my local retailer store on friday and love it the dress is well made with some heft to the yarn the colors of the yarn blue white and grey seem to shimmer a bit due to their weave but there is no metallic thread in the dress that i can tell i know some have written that the dress is a sack but not on me i toyed with buying this online and then didnt due to the negative comments about the dress i bought an extra small and it fits well i usually where an x small,1
12526,I tried these on in the store and they are super cozy at they hit me just above the ankle in the regular length i came to the website to get the petite length hoping for a better fit in the rise as well as a slightly shorter leg length these pants are comfortable without looking sloppy,1

12531,I saw this sweater and just about died i loved the accentuated shoulders and beautiful knit detail on the sleeves lucky for me retailer day started a couple of days after this sweater debuted and i snagged it right away i just got it and am in love it fits true to size and the shoulders and sleeves are everything i hoped they would be the neckline in very flattering as well it is soft and the color is gorgeous if there is a negative it would be that it is a bit boxy in the torso and doe,1
12532,I ordered the black and white pattern which was ok i got a small but the shirt was very square with a short and wide fit i doubt an xs would have helped with such a boxy shirt sent this one back,0
12533,This dress fits to a t true to size very flattering fabric is soft and comfortable,1

12535,I really wanted to love these because i love my other steps but they did not feel or fit the same way at all i was also disappointed to see that they are cream and not white these jeans feel stiffer than other stets i own and the waist was huge on me sadly these will be going back,0
12536,I love this top the fabric is so soft and its perfect with white pants yes it does run wide and is short but if you get the correct size it looks just like it does on the model,1

12538,Soft and cozy the orange is vibrant the green is more subtle and has gray tones usually wear a small bought the xxs too full and too sloppy in the xs ad small,1
12539,I ordered this dress expecting a cool lightweight summer dress i believe it says cotton in the descriptionhowever the material is a very heavy cottonlinen blendwould have much preferred a better quality fabricthe color is a nice green and is well madeit runs large except in the bust which fit well,0
12540,I love this kimono the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement,1
12541,I lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it fits well although i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway fits very true to size i cant wait to wear this with boots and leggings,1
12542,Love this top cloth stone makes excellent quality clothes that are durable and have unique details this top can go with many different looks and i cant wait to take it out for a spini bought the medallion crops to go with this top and it is an awesome combo i would definitely check it out,1
12543,This shirt dress has the right amount of body skimming drape and length to flatter my short potbellied square waisted self i wish they made more versions more colors more sleeves,1
12544,This is the prettiest little nighty it is romantic soft and so very pretty i really adore everything about this piece but the pink detail on the trim along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love,1
12545,I am not in love with this top and will be returning it from the front it looks like a basic tee which i expected but the back x is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesnt look like an x as the picture shows so basically the focal point of the tee falls short,0
12546,These pants are uhmazing i love that they have a seam in the front of the leg and in the back of the leg i didnt notice it in the photo online but in person it stands out more and anything vertical on my petite frame is a way to go these are my new favorite pantsi wish pilcro would make this style in more colors and fabrics i wear a p or a p and im glad i got the p because its true these are tight in the leg but i think thats a good thing since cords look awful when the,1

12549,I was leary about ordering this but absolutely loved it when it arrived i found out the front could be the back and the back could be the front reversible right and the styling of the shirt was very complimentary to my body,1
12550,I love this top it is modest enough for work but fun enough for weekends soft comfortable and lovely pink color i want it in every color it seems to only come in two colors thoughsoft flowy fabric is lined with a soft inner fabric as well super flattering for any body type,1
12551,From the images it looks like a basic black cardigan look again because its a beautiful fabric and can be dressed up or down im and always wear an xsmall at retailer however i thought it to wear over other articles vogue clothing id size up it fits perfect i did an xsmall petite and couldnt be happier,1
12552,This is a soft comfortable shirt it fits like a tshirt should i usually buy m but based on other reviews i purchased s the fit on me in size small is similar to the model in the photo,1
12553,I just received this dress after ordering it online and im already in love the fit is perfect i tend to have issues with bust areas of dresses being too small and this fits just right the material is light and perfect for southwest florida,1
12554,This top looks great and feels great got lots of compliments when i wore it for thanksgiving i pretty plan to wear this for every holiday event this year and will layer it with sweaters and scarves to mix it up,1
12555,I was returning an in line order from same designer and saw this dress i love it much prettier in person this will get well worn by me,1
12556,I love this shirt great mix of chic comfortable and feminine can wear for many occasions,1
12557,The shirt is absolutely cute looking but thats just thatlooks im size wears m to l top i tried on the medium in the store it was rather flowing i liked it but i didnt like how it fit on the underarm area it hung very low so i ordered a petite m still the same plus the store the lighting was dark so i didnt realize how see through the shirt was too had to return it,0
12558,When i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store it instantly caught my attention since it was pricey i didnt get it when it went on sale it ran out in my size so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for off the sale price this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt,1
12559,Saturdaysunday never disappoints love this black cardigan runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me not a problem anywhere else though good medium weight to the fabric durable quality and waist flattering once tied great for throwing on over a dress wearing with a tshirt,1
12560,I have a small collection of retailer pants for work and this pair fit neatly into a hole i dont have a fun patterned pair i am short and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot my usual p fit perfectly up above the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture the fabric is nice quality smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch and i like the fact that these are machine washable this gal has other things to do with her life besid,1
12561,This a lovely piece you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details i typically wear xxsp or xsp so i did not expect this to fit but decided to try it because i liked the style as a petite many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents not this one the xxs fit nicely just the right length and width i am and lbs i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos and not when you search for sweaters it,1
12562,Very pleased with my purchase the subtle details within the dress add to its simple elegance very soft and comfortable definitely recommend,1
12563,When i received this top i thought it was even prettier than the online picture the colors and beading are more vibrant in person it is a full cut and does have an elastic band at the bottom but i liked the way it looked on i ordered my usual size m and it fit me the same as it did the model in the picture it is pretty shear if you wear it to work or during the daytime it will need a cami however in evening lighting i dont find it to be that see through and i feel comfortable wearing,1
12564,I got this top in the beige size small it is flattering and though i hadnt noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it they are a nice touch this is a versatile piece i can dress it up or down this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season,1
12565,I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model i dont typically buy this style of dress because many times they are unflattering on me im and lbs in very good shape the small was perfect for me a size up wouldve resulted in a baggier look the length is perfect above my knee not too short but short enough so i dont look frumpy the dress drapes beautifully and i can wear it with tights and boots now and capri tights and wedge sandals in,1
12566,I love this shirtdress the lace and collar design pops off the black super comfortable and love that it has pockets a keeper this one not going back ever i am and lbs and the fits perfect the length comes above my knee so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinnys underneath,1
12567,I love these the white actually has a more pronounced look between the top and bottom with a little but of shading since they look a bit different because of that i got both white and black perfect wait and not to giant and perfect for year round work the shawl color is a tad flimsy in how it sits but overall these are fabulous,1
12568,Pilcro pants are always a positive purchase quality fabric great design i purchased the pink for spring and whenever prettier in person than on line they are a peachy pink color will go with anything dress them up or down,1
12569,Online this jacket is supposedly an online exclusive but i saw it in green at my local store i had to try it on and i loved it it does swing but is not to much fabric the drape is really nice it is shorter in the front and longer in the back it sort of shows that on the model but is much more noticeable in person this jacket is not lined and i would say more of a shirt this is perfect for spring or cooler summer nights or over a tank or short sleeve in the winter i also love lyocell it j,1
12570,This top turned out to be better than expected im a large girl and the length is enough to cover my hips and the shirt it not tight at all the embroidery details are lovely too i bought this for a trip to italy this summer because it is cotton and because i consider it to be a classic piece being that it is black and white one nice feature is this top does not have to be worn off shoulder it looks just great with the sleeves up,1
12571,I looooove these pants i was looking for a cool pair of white pants since last summer i tried them on and they make my bootie look great they are also not see through which i love i love this brand and these pants will be my new summer staple ps they were a bit snug then relaxed a little after wears,1
12572,Love the material it is a thick cotton but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it doesnt cling to me in a bad way its like wearing a sweater my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette the black material is the same as the gray and it also has a herringbone pattern thats not really visible in the pictures i would have preferred a uniform material rather than a panel sewn in not a huge d,1
12573,This dress is incredibly soft with sleeves that can be rolled up or down it is extremely versatile while the dress is very comfortable and mostly fits true to size i found it to be ever so slightly snug through the hips at first however i am somewhat difficult to fit with an accentuated hourglass figure overall i am very happy with this purchase and look forward to wearing it during my travels,1
12574,I was so pleasantly surprised when i received this in the mail because its much more substantial than i thought it would be its perfect for fall and spring and the lining is very soft i thought itd be more difficult to wear but it goes well with everything i ordered my usual size small and am happy with the fit,1
12575,I am lbs and i got xs petite it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone as stated in my review title the material is quite heavy and great quality which helps it hang nicely cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional love it with my laceup espadrilles,1
12576,It is one of my favorites from retailer i received so many compliments while wearing it i usually wear a but i sized down to a and still had plenty of room,1
12577,Retailer consistently provides unique sophisticated and quality made clothing with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies i shop with them exclusively i suppose that i cant expect perfection from retailerbut of the timethats what i get this is that this sweater is truly awful i cannot or find it very difficult at least begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front,0
12578,I love these shorts love that the inseam is longer than the pattern is awesome perfect for spring my thighs are always going to be bigger than most so i sized up size like i do in all cartonnier pants these are a must have for springsummer,1
12579,Top is blouse and long enough to stay tucked in if you want like the laser cut detail front and back sleeveless is great for summer months here can wear to work or dress down with jeans fit is true to size i am slim and small busted so anything fits me i would think it youre busty it would be fine as its a blousy fitthe color is more of a salmon pink which works for me however if your looking for a true pink it may not work,1
12580,Very flattering ang comfy but they do run slightly big i stayed with my true size because i am thicker in waist but if small waisted size down fit tys in legs and bottom love color,1
12581,To be honest i bought this sweater as an addon so i could get free shipping however its the only piece i actually kept from the order this sweatshirt is warm fleecelined and just the right amount of billow but the best part is the subtle lavender color when i ordered it i didnt even realize i ordered lavender again i wasnt paying much attention to this piece but the color and texture are so softdefinitely a must buy for reference i am pounds and the xs my usual,1
12582,Cute twist with the open back on a simple classic sweater light weight,1
12583,This top is just amazing it does run large so size down but fit and feel is wonderful especially if you would like to hide some lumps and bumps this is the perfect top,1
12584,Gorgeous shirt the detail on this shirt is impeccable even with its boxy shape it was very flattering on my petite curvy frame id say this shirt runs just a tad big im lbs and the xs fit perfectly,1
12585,Im in love with this super cute dress the material feels so good on my skin and it has more body than it appears on the pic im lbs i bought the s petite and its perfect for me slightly loose i could have probably fit in an xs but i like the freedom that the s gives me it my official spring dress,1
12586,I love this top so much online i received it yesterday in the mail and unfortunately i am very disappointed there is nothing wrong with the quality but i do think it looks more appealing online also this top is probably not for anyone with a large chest it looks nice and drapey on the model when i put it on it just makes me look fat and the top thanks to my dds looks more like a swing top im sure its a lovely top on very thin people with a smaller chest,0
12587,I loved how this looked on the model however once i tried on in store i was greatly disappointed i usually wear a meduim and the small and extrasmall were huge on me there was so much extra material that i was swimming in this i had such high hopes for this there were no petite sizes to try on in the store but i am not sure it would have helped,0
12588,I saw this dress online and fell in love with it it is just as beautiful in person too very delicate but receive so many compliments every time i wear it is two separate pieces a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress i am and need a inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging probably could have tried to order the petite but figured id probably be wearing heals anyway i normally wear a in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering the top half is flow,1
12589,Im in love with this dress and first tried on the petite size in the store if you dont have enormous shoulders which i do i think the petite would fit someone in the range what im trying to say is the dress is pretty long the cut is beautiful and patterns perfectly complementary ive been reading marie kondos book and this one sparks joy,1
12590,Only negative thing is that it sheds and even that is not really very negative i would buy it again in a heartbeat,1
12591,This dress is beautiful and extremely well made there is s little more weight to the fabric than i had assumed but its nice for falltransitioncooler temps im so sad that i will most likely return this dress because its just not working on my postpartum body but there is a part of me that wants to keep it because of how stunning it is,1
12592,Loving the ombr color combination the smooth lining the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front if you are busty or hourglass stay tts or size up if you are straight andor small busted size down if you have a round bottom but slender on top im not sure this dress will fit the way you want do try it on in person,1
12593,The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget a very cheap polyester on top of that it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way so you can bet that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing ive attached a picture of the hem below on top of that the ruching is awkward as mentioned by another reviewers all in all kind of terrible,0
12594,This dress did not disappoint it fits great im and weigh and i got a petite xs length was perfect i have a longer torso so the waist was a bit higher than mine but it didnt sit strangely and hung well i am small chested and the top fit me very well i think if you have been blessed in that area you may want to size up overall it really is beautiful the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer i,1
12595,I bought this top about weeks ago love it i like it because its better than a plain tshirt so its perfect for running around doing errands or shopping i like the material and the length im and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short i wash it and hang it to dry no shrinking or pilling so far i am ordering this in at least two more colors,1
12596,Love so comfy i wish they came in more colors id order every one,1
12597,The cut is on the boxy side and im not sold on the tiered effect but i love the silk fabric and the print so much that i just dont care the silk is deliciously light and breathable and the print is neutral enough that i can pair it with several different cardigans and necklaces to mix it up and the quality of construction is excellentall of the seams were expertly sewn and pressed and the print was lined up like in the online picture given the material and construction quality its de,1
12598,I liked everything about this tunic except the way that it looked on me the fabric was great not too heavy not too light the design was cute and i loved the colors i got the yellow it was cut well and a good length for me i am that being said i am curvy and i felt like i looked even rounder in this top if i was taller it probably would have been perfect,1
12599,I was so excited to receive the playa tunic in the mail i love the colors and the flowy bottom and raw edges this tunic could be worn as a dress or with jeggings jeans or leggings this is a wonderful fall transition piece,1
12600,I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabricits very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse will be returning it,0
12601,Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable i typically am a ml in retailer the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose these are not see through at all i ordered the color shown on the model i am about feet so the pants are not as cropped on me,1
12602,I would wear this everyday if i could the red color is so rich and the cut and structure of the top is perfect and flattering ive worn to work out or dressed down with jeans and flip flops,1
12603,Love this blazer its a heavy jersey fabric which is comfortable all day with no wrinkling and it has a cute light grey jersey knit trim around the pockets which adds visual interest and keeps it from being a boring navy blazer the sizing is correct i wear a and the fits perfectly its got a slightly athletic boyfriend fit its not boxy but dont look for a really skinny tight fit around the waste,1
12604,The sweater runs large the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy i would never be able to wear it out of the house however the material is exceptionally soft and delightful keeping as its a great stay at home lounge sweater but way over priced for this purpose if you can get the fabric to lay correctly youre a genius,0
12605,I bought this in the pattern in a size medium i am a size around the hipsbutt the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didnt outline every curve of my butt the material is very soft and comfortable but it didnt feel thin or cheap or seethrough it has a nice weight to it i am tall almost and it fit me just as it appears in the picture,1
12606,Wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy i havent worn skorts since the s and this was such a nice return to that trend,1
12607,I spotted this dress at my local retailer to be honest i saw it on a rack with a sale sign on it and didnt think much of it then i saw it on a salespersonwow i think this dress looks much better on someone than on the hangerso i recommend trying it oni am band i bought an xs it fits really wellright about the knee similar to how it is shown in the photo so taller women may find it to be a little shorterthe rufflefabric that comes down the side adds an interesting,1
12608,This is a comfortable and easy shirt that is meant to be slightly looser i wear a size small in all cloth and stone and found this shirt to be true to size the extra small was too tight in the shoulders and didnt have the right look to itsame fabric as my other cloth and stone items however i had to steam the cuffed sleeves and back pleating after washing and drying to make it look nice and crisp also the cuffed sleeves are sewn that way which i like,1
12609,This is a very pretty top with a nice flow i love the delicate pattern it fits perfectly and is great for work or the weekend,1
12610,Im really pleased with this jumpsuit it has great detailing not visible in the online image and the fabric is so soft and comfortable the navy is lovely im normally a medium or size i ordered the medium online and it was far too baggy especially on top i tried on the small and x small in store and the x small fit exactly how i wanted as worn by the model and the pants were still long enough im glad i didnt give up on it,1
12611,I was not a fan of these leggings these were very unflattering i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out i just didnt feel like they would hold up for even one season,0
12612,While i wouldnt normally look at this piece the price was unbeatable i was even more impressed when it arrived and i tried it on the design is reminiscent of an old time patchwork quilt fairy tale more beautiful in person than in the pic the covered buttons at the neck and wrists are just lovely and feminine and the dress falls and flows around me in a fun and flirty way i paired it with charcoal heather tights and dark gray booties super cute you wont regret it,1
12613,I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress its loose and flows but doesnt look like a potato sack i wore it once and got a ton of compliments that said i hand washed it as the tag states then let it line dry and it shrunk to half its size i rechecked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states dry clean recommended boo so disappointed that i spend over for a dress i wore once,0
12614,As other reviewers have stated it is hard to see in the photos that the dress has iridescent bluepinklavender sequins i was surprised as well but in a good way i think it has a unique look and is so pretty and romantic its a vision of shimmer when you are walking if you have somewhat of a bust i would size up because the triangles run a little small other than that its a beautiful dress,1
12615,This hoodie is just what i had hoped it would beit is super soft comfortably loose but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low vneck its just the right amount of sexy it will be my goto this fall and winter,1
12616,Material was a tad rough for my liking the color did nothing for my olive complexion given the price of this shirt even with off i dont think its worth it if im spending on a blouse i need to love it and i do not love this onegoing back,0
12617,I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on it doesnt look nearly as good on the hanger so definitely worth trying on the fabric is high quality and super comfy the fit is very flattering i am curvy and got the navy stripe print in size small its very forgiving fitted without clinging to any problem areas i also love how versatile it isyou can wear it as a dress as shown on the models or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggingsleggings love it,1
12618,Beautiful material and washable im vertically challenged and the slits are a tad bit high even for me but still tasteful i would suggest sizing down as im normally a medium in retailer but due to the nature of the material i opted to size down and im so glad i did no arm hole struggles with my particular dress either overall just a really cute versatile cozy and functional option that will certainly get plenty of exposure for many winters to come,1
12619,I found this dress to run true to size im and lbs and the xs fits great perfect length and i like the thicker fabric so its not see through the raw edges lend a cool laid back and the final embroidery is a perfect bohemian touch wearing mine with a turquoise choker awesome dress,1
12620,I wore this dress for an after party the day of my wedding day in new orleans going to a music lounge seriously i kept getting compliments its fits beautiful and i just love the different type of patterns,1
12621,Saw this in the catalog and had to have it i paid full price while the buttons arent functional it is not too revealing i work in a casual office and it will be perfectly appropriate especially paired with a jean jacket the length is right above knee i am and went with the xs,1
12622,These pants are flattering and comfortable plus they are cute cute cute im a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top but with a solid black or ivoryoff white top they are perfect can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or girlfriends lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck highly recommend,1
12623,This top is huge im typically a size or i bought the and its huge its wider than it is long even if i sized down to a it would still be too much fabric im so disappointed beautiful color and fabric but theres so much fabric i love a flowy top but this one is way too much i will be returning this top,0
12624,Kind of excited about this little number i found it online and was immediately drawn to the bohochic look it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo,1
12625,Full disclosure im six months pregnant as such this dress is perfect for me its soft and flown and i look like i have a cute bump instead of like im wearing a sack i ordered my usual medium based on other reviews and t fits perfectlyso it would have been too big normally,1
12626,Made my wedding outfit perfect,1
12627,Super comfortable top easily washable options with the sleeves and a nice drape to the fabric truly a goanywhere top,1
12628,This blouse is gorgeous on i purchased at my local store i noticed it was omg its so nice on its soft and comfortable and the gold threading make it sunning it does run a little small in the chest area,1
12629,This sweater is gorgeous ordered in the grey motif was as described and wonderfully soft i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs looking forward to the colder months,1
12630,I love this skirt its a denim material so its structured but not too heavy for warm weather the colors are bright it may run a bit big but i didnt have trouble with my usual size the pockets are actually usable great for casual and easy to dress up,1
12631,Pretty color but i was hoping for a thicker higher quality material for the price the material is lightweight and isnt tailored well looks kind of sloppy,0
12632,Looks great on the photo and from previous reviews i decided to give it a try the material seems cheap and stiff would not fit my frame well,0
12633,I love this skirt for so many reasons one it isnt a circle skirt per se which is good i am hip heavy and dont need extra volume at my hips so while its called a circle skirt the description states that its aline based on that i was willing to risk it also i am and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths just my personal preference although i am only i ordered the regular size for the extra length and its exactly at my knee perfect for me,1
12634,Bought this dress for a friends wedding i have since worn it to two others and the opera numerous times its my favorite little black dress as its sexy and modest at the same time i receive numerous compliments every time i wear it its easy to get into the zipper is sturdy and the fabric is breathable stretchy but not clingy,1
12635,Love this sweatersoft and cozy and the ruffles are not overwhelmingjust a touch of prettyit will look pretty with a turquoise necklace for a pop of colorclassic comfy and classyan anhtro a runs very true to size ordered my usual size an it fits perfectly,1
12636,This shirt fits really well i ordered a size small and its definitely a bit form fitting i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first for a tshirt its a pretty hefty price but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny,1
12637,This is the most comfortable sweet beautiful romantic and timeless dress i bought the green motif one is sz and it fits perfectly i am smaller chested usually a mediumlarge up top depending on the item and a sz xl for pants so perhaps this dress runs one size small the color in the detail shot is most accurate its bright cheerful and dreamy,1
12638,This dress is beautiful and the a line shape is very flattering im and it hits just above my knees im small on top so the keyhole slit isnt an issue for me but it does gap more than it does on the model this dress has lots of versatility like another reviewer said you can dress it up with heels or dress it down with boots,1
12639,I tried this on in the store in a medium by accident thinking that it was a large i loved it even though the front was way too short on me and the elastic waist was way too tight the store didnt have the next size up and after reading the other reviews i decided to order my standard xl online its a keeper i am plus sized and have an ample mid section and this was still flattering on me i plan to wear it with a black duster sweater leggings and boots all winter long and then when the wea,1
12640,Great cut fit the length is perfect too i like the weight of the skirt overall good for all seasons,1
12641,I love this dress i am an hourglass and found this dress to be super flattering and such a unique find i usually avoid pockets in front like this but it works on this dress so happy i found it,1
12642,I just love all pilcro pants they are great for any occasion any type of weather i am lb and i wear a in all pilcro pants and they fit perfectly only bummer is that i have to iron them but they iron easily length of these pants is just a tad long but i can wear wedges with them and that solves the problem,1
12643,Fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats boots or booties true to size for reference i am with an athletic build,1
12644,This is my new favorite dress its super soft comfortable and flattering i have worn it twice and each time have received multiple compliments i love love love it,1
12645,I adore the feel and cut of these culottes but the quality has diminished my faith in retailer picks piles and serious wear and tear after just one day i feel as if i wasted my money,0
12646,There wasnt much question as to whether or not id love these pants as i have several pairs of the pilcro hyphen pant however this one is slightly different front pockets and seam down frontand though they are slightly different the fit and cut are the samethese pants are a great weightcan wear year round reallybut these will be my go to pants this fall and winterthe length is nicecan wear with shoes or rolled up with boots tooutility chinos yesthe fit is nicely,1
12647,What a beautiful flowing top i am either a large or xl in tops but only needed a large in this top i purchased it in the neutral color but will probably get it in plum if you have some flaws in your middle this conceals everything the material is so soft you can dress it up or down and wear it from now until late fall the plum color was beautiful but i have more to wear with neutral a great versatile top,1
12648,Great chinos but they run a size large i ordered my normal pants size and had to return them for one size down i actually like them so much after finding the right size i bought a second pair in store i have the grey and mustard yellow love them just order a size down,1
12649,I love this top i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy this top is perfect it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size great for busty girls dd,1
12650,Love this jacket saw it in the store and waited a few days before breaking down and buying it in the peach color glad i did as it sold out super fast its soft flattering versatile and has great detail in the stitching perfect layer for fall im usually a large sometimes medium in hei hei jackets and the large fit very comfortably with room for light layers underneath the style is a little boxy and slouchy but the fit in the shoulders and elastic ribbed waistband give it a flattering f,1
12651,The perfect fit and style of any jean ever i order one size up in petites i love these jeans and want them in every colorwash they have wonderful stretch that does not sag i wear them with cuffs folded up in hot weather but can also wear them down thanks to petite styling love love,1
12652,I bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse but found they were whats been missing in my life after wearing them nearly every other day i decided i needed another pairfeel like yoga pants but look polished make your butt look perky and your legs slim maybe i need another pair,1
12653,Not sure why this says online exclusive as i bought it in green in the store i also saw it in a mustard color at another location but in any casethis is an adorable and flattering dress fabric is kind of a chino weighty but not too heavy great color and design runs a bit small my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size i love it and would buy it in more colors,1
12654,I love this topthe fabric the color they way it hangs im glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra wouldnt show,1
12655,I dont have a large head but i could barely squeeze this blouse over mine i also ordered the xs even though im usually a small and it was still blousier than i would have liked already returned it on the plus side its gorgeous,0
12656,I love this dress it flatters so nicely im and pretty thin it hugs all my curves snugly,1
12657,I was hesitant to buy this dress with all the reviews regarding poor fit particularly in the bust area but its so unique that i decided to give it a try anyway by ordering a petite size i was pleasantly surprised to find that it fits beautifully in my usual size i did not find the bust to be small at all and the overall fit was very slimming and flattering for reference i am lbs dd and the size p looks great and is very comfortable the p might have worked too the material,1
12658,These jeans look great with everything and fit great i can dress them up with wedges or throw them on with flip flops and they are so comfortable too ive had many compliments already,1
12659,I ordered this shirt in both white and coral i absolutely love the design and coral color the white was a bit see through so i returned it it would be cute with a cami under but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer overall it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back,1
12660,Love this top i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size very comfortable and true to size,1
12661,I have been a loyal retailer customer for at least years now so i dont say this lightly this might be my favorite clothing purchase ever the overall design is incredible the feminine detail in the embroidery combined with the traditional bomber style is done so well i somehow snagged a medium petite and it is absolutely perfect there is enough room to fit a sweater underneath but the sleeves and waist are the perfect length something which is difficult to find at also i must say,1
12662,The dress is absolutely beautiful the fabric is light the pattern is not overwhelming and has a zipper on the side to make it more fitted in the waist the top is blousy but i am only a c cup and it still was perfect the bottom has an uneven cut that makes the dress very interesting i love it i am usually a size or and the size was perfect,1
12663,This is a really great bathing suit top i havent purchased a bikini in about years so im glad this is the one i finally purchased the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous the fabric itself is soft and comfortable i listed it as a true to size fit but if youre on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage im a size through and through and so ordered a m per their size standards the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette,1
12664,I chose this dress for my engagement photoshoot and im so glad i did it is beyond beautiful my favorite dress ever,1
12665,This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it i love absolutely anything with a full shape and this dress has it its cut like a circleso ladies this dress has a lot of fabric im and wouldnt be able to wear it as a dress but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings the arms are a tad more fitted though i have larger arms which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine if you love a cool quirky piece this one is a winner,1
12666,This dress looks better in person nice navy with subtle pattern looks super cute with a really lightweat pale yellow sweater i thought that wiastband area would hit in a funky spot my problem area but it doesnt and looks great super comfortable and i love this neckline also has a decent lining so no bra necessary if youre cool with that i have packed on some after lbs and wear a shirt and pant and the large is roomy enoughi received a number of compliments and lets fa,1
12667,This is a modernized hippie sweater so beautiful blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality the large flowers add attitude pockets show comfort it is soft part silk fabric and lays nicely it is not thick enough for warmth but there is room for a tissue turtleneck regular s fits me well it should be relaxed look not fitted and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots i am ftin b waist hips and the hem falls right above my knees,1
12668,These chinos fit great they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear i bought all colors,1
12669,This white shirt is a perfect canvas i can dress it up with a scarf for work or wear it with my favorite jeans its perfect for all body shapes with the aline i love how comfortable this shirt feels i like wearing this shirt with my black knit pants and my retailers braided collar vest,1
12670,True to size and fits great the sleeves are the perfect size and its so versatile,1
12671,Because of my body type i never thought i could wear a romper i tried this on out of curiosity and am so glad i did it fits well i did size up because of my thighs is comfortable and an alternative to a dress the patterned bottom did not accentuate my lower body which was a worry i got compliments when i wore this to dinner with a pair of sandals,1
12672,I bought this dress to wear to my graduation where i was receiving a degree in horticulture i also just had a child a few weeks prior and was worried about sizing the high waist worked well for the post pregnancy belly i am and was typically around lbs prepregnancy which was typically a in dresses i ordered a petite in this dress and it was perfect the only area that was sort of tight was the bosom but i am nursing so i expected as much the petite length was perfect for my he,1
12673,Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down atleast on me,1
12674,This shirt is comfortable loose but doesnt make you look like youre shapeless it compliments,1
12675,This shirt is just precious i cannot wait to pair it with a pair of white skinny jeans and wedges in the spring im so in love with it the detail is just beautiful,1
12676,Im always looking for something that is unique and can be layered this looks just like it does on the model youll need a cami underneath as it is not lined a little shorter in front than in the back but drapes nicely styled it with black denim ankle jeans black loafers or boots and a blue denim jacket im d and the s fit well,1
12677,I absolutely love this top i am short but curvy on the bottom with a dd bust i ordered the xl only because of my upper body it fits great as i dont like anything to hug my body but it doesnt look like a tent has a little aline shape to it another reason i go for the larger size is i like to dry all my clothes ordered the grey and will order in the black also,1
12678,I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive but the other colors were not even in the same material but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex,0
12679,This is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall it is rayon so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin it is also washable i think it looks much better in person than onlinei opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and evenlooking as it tended to gap slightly at the topfor reference i am lb but have broad shoulders making my usual best size a medium in most tops and,1
12680,I am not someone who normally wears overalls this is actually my first pair but im so glad that i took the plunge and bought these they fit amazingly while being both perfectly trendy and perfectly timeless if you are on the fence about overalls in general these are a perfect first pairim a in most denim brands and was also a in these the bottom portion fits perfectly and doesnt look sloppy like i assumed overalls would be at all the top is perfectly casual im so ha,1

12682,These are great but unfortunately ran small for me in comparison to my other pilcro jeans i returned and the size i need is sold out now,1
12683,This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase and i love it the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try and it fit perfectly im lbs slim looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles still a couple inches above the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun would defi,1
12684,Love love love this silk dress i feel classic retailer is back perfect for hot and steamy summer daysjust a few photos of the back which has the belt band sewn in kind of high so that it can be wrapped through the side loops grecian style for some reason in the online back photo the model is wearing the dress backwards im currently or hips narrow shoulders and torso bra size dddc i tried on the size regular which is the only one i found in the s,1
12685,This top is even more beautiful and vibrant in person but you definitely need a racerback cami underneath it as the laser cuts are big the first time i wore it today i got a number of compliments a definite keeper,1
12686,This dress fits really cute i actually think its cuter in person than on the site really flattering the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model so its appropriate for work and networking functions im lbs i got the and its great,1
12687,I own many blouses by tiny the arms on this blouse billow out which was not flattering or thinning on me the shirt was just blah,0
12688,I love this top i ordered the print and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans and even coral shorts very flattering i did go up a size from xs to s based on other reviews and im glad i did the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip,1
12689,This caftan is very light and wellmade i love the colors and designs on this fabric i was worried that it might make me look boxy but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well the fabric is so soft im amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful coverup,1
12690,I get more compliments on the stress it is perfect for work perfect for summer night concert perfect date night love this dress,1
12691,Was excited to try this interesting skirt as a mega bailey fan however this skirt didnt fit well the waist was fine but it then was boxy and shapeless on me in an xssize my piece also had a wrinkle from folding and im not sure how it would easily come out but the main thing is that the lines werent flattering to the body the vegan quilting isnt luxurious i thought the diagonal zipper style was cool but it doesnt lay to advantage when worn and im an easy fit length is soso,0
12692,I love this tee s much i bought different colors the back is beautiful it is so comfy and soft but its added spice makes it perfect for those times you want a little more style,1
12693,I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected i felt dowdy in it,0
12694,I bought these last year and loved them however they came in tall sizes this year they do not and the inseam is just way too short even at im and they barely graze the floor with no break in the pant leg i prefer to wear them with boots and they will not be long enough even with a short heal,0
12695,I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut loose but not baggy or unflattering i bought a small but could have probably sized down so theres a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing great length for jeans or leggings,1
12696,I saw this sweater online and i fell in love with it i was hoping to wear it for christmas it arrived on time and it was such an amazing color there is a touch of orange to the red color it has a buttoned collar and i like wearing it with one button open it has to be one of the softest most comfy sweaters ive ever worn i wore it with skinny jeans and boots it would be fine with leggings too the style and quality is superb as always im very pleased with this purchase,1
12697,I just received this dress tried it on i totally fell in love with it the pink is just beautifulits a little big so i will definitely will be exchanging it for a size you would absolutely love this dress,1
12698,This was my first time to purchase and wear a tunic and i was very hesitant about the look but i love this design it is beautiful and seems to be very well made i agree with a previous reviewer that the slit is high it comes to my waist but i dont think it is a problem i always appreciate this in other reviews so hopefully it helps im lbs and a small b the xs works well for me,1
12699,This jumpsuit runs large so i sized down perfectly one full size down i have a size b chest and was very comfortable with no bra as the built in cups gave me the perfect coverage it looked like a dress standing but had such a flattering and fun shape when you move everyone loved it,1
12700,Love these pants super comfortable but feel high quality i am usually a size and the xs fits perfectly,1
12701,Bought this dress as a winter dress it looks amazing and even more so with some boots love it also its more gray than blue although i like that,1
12702,Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern i almost got the black because i thought it would be timeless but the print is so fun im glad i went with it ordered a size m for reference i am lbs c and the fit is comfortable i dont need a lot of support and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom i think itll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip this is the first onepiece ive had since i was a gi,1
12703,I love this dress i got the coral and its clean and simple but with visually interesting lines the top is a slightly heavier stretchy fabric no zippers or closures while the skirt is made of a lighter fabric that gives it a bit of flirty swing the hem is also slightly asymmetrical which i didnt notice from the online pictures its a very comfortable dress that i could see being very versatile dressed up for work dressed down for daytime weekend wear or even for date night i a,1
12704,Ooo la la sooo chic sooo retailer,1
12705,The fabric is very light weight more of a shirting material this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes it is so soft and light there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right very flattering it does run big tho,1
12706,If youre a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering hangs nicely in the front not too clingy also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat the plum is gorgeous was king it for the first time so cant yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation,1
12707,I love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same the cut and the fit are free and easy so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore washes well hang dry easy to care for i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style,1
12708,Im glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual mediumlarge since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it i adore the color pattern slim profile and cut in arm holes wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated,1
12709,I wasnt sure how the fabric would be since i ordered it online but i wasnt disappointed its got a lot of movement which makes it really comfortable while still being cute its a little longer than i anticipated but i dont mind that it just gives it a little more versatility also it has pockets i love pockets so maybe im a little biased,1
12710,A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer i probably would have never thought to try it on i am and normally a size or a medium the size small was still too large so i ordered a size small petite it fits perfectly looks adorable on and is so comfortable i cant wait for the warm weather to wear it,1
12711,This is top makes me feel happy and pretty with a saturdaysunday black tank or any cami you will love yourself in it tts and matches most any skirt good price too can wear with skirts or pants,1
12712,This must be the only structured t shirt at retailer at the time of this review i love it the neckline is perfection the ruched sleeves are long enough to cover my upper arms i found it a bit see through and added a white camisizing i ordered an xs normally i wear a small in retailer brands and a med in most other brands size small ts have been too large lately im tall lbs d long torso narrow across the shoulders and short arms fit loose fitting ts l,1
12713,This dress is gorgeous but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly im and tried both the petite thinking it would fall more like a midi and the regular hoping it would fit like a maxi should both hit at a very awkward spot on my midshin as much as i loved and wanted it it looked too weird to justify buying,1
12714,I bought the mauve color and its very pretty i felt as though sizing up was a better choice im usually an xs or a small and i went with the small i liked the length of the small better the shoulders add a cute look to it,1
12715,I wish this shirt would not have had so much material it would make a great maternity top if you are really thin it might work for you too,0
12716,I love this dress i am lbs and ordered the size the fit is excellent and is very flattering the color is more kelly green than what is shown in the picture and is lovely i wore it to my th celebration and adored wearing the dress,1
12717,I have an upsidedown triangle shape i am a on the bottom and a on top i have a short waist i have very slim hips and virtually no waist so a typical jumpsuit or romper really doesnt fit me this one is the exception likely because it ties in the back but the s fit me perfectly the bottom half is easy but not oversized the top half of the jumpsuit is adjustable so there is no issue with size i am c on top but i think that i could pull off the top without a bra you can,1
12718,An absolutely gorgeous but poorly fitting blouse the bottom part is way too billowy and inconsistent with the fitted top half got it on sale and still returned it,0
12719,Just picked this up at the store off sale price well worth it the petite hits perfect on my frame right about where it hits the model in the pic very well made good quality piece i can see myself wearing quite often,1
12720,These pants are very very cute and high quality they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down they are also very flattering i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch but the next size up was perfect,1
12721,Im not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake but i received the chiffon shell but there was no slip as pictured it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer i had high hopes but sadly this is being returned the xs is out of stock now so i cant even reorder bummer,0
12722,I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great the fabric is thin which is nice for summer but lined at the top half so its not transparent except below the knee the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite sadly it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast,1
12723,Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments they do fall open when you sit down though they have liner shorts inside for coverage they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite,1
12724,This top is cute and comfortable i did order a size larger than i would normally wear i usually wear a size small but i had to buy a medium lbs b,1
12725,Love this top the color is very pretty great for the holidays i havent washed it yet but it says machine wash which is a plus for me,1
12726,I just received these jeans today after buying them online last week i wasnt sure how they would fit but i am so very happy i got them and on sale too i am and about pounds athletic and curvy but petite too i bought the size and they are a perfect fit in the length too they are button up boyfriend style but not too baggy the detail on the cuff is perfect and they have a unique unusual but expensive look what a steal i would have paid full price for jeans that fit this,1
12727,Love this jacket it fits very well and is super comfortable you can wear it to work or on the weekends super versatile,1
12728,I ordered a size large i recently had a baby and was looking for a top to hide my baby belly until i lose it this shirt fits amazingly i dont find the sleeves to be snug at all if the shirt wasnt so distinctive id order in several colors the quality is fantastic for a tee and has a nubbed appearance you cant see in the photos,1
12729,Ordered this blouse in a small but it was too big returned it for an xs i weigh lbs im i find sizing of clothing at retailer to be unreliable i have had to return many items because of sizing issues unfortunately i live too far away from a regular store so have to rely on shopping on linei will complement retailer on the unique designs of the clothing they offer,1
12730,This top is soft flattering modest enough to wear to work but subtly sexy and im amply endowed at d i just wish id gotten one in every color,1
12731,Beautiful fabric with soft drape unfortunately the captain kangaroo pockets are awful unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people dont want added bulk very disappointing returned,0
12732,Ordered online hedging my bets on size chose xss because i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and wear anything from sizes depending on brand my gamble paid off its a beautiful sweater soft comfortable nice drapei suspect that finerboned more petite customers might complain of swimming in this but it worked well for me,1
12733,This top is perfect very comfortable and flattering for any body type,1
12734,These are my favorite jeans ive bought in the past year theyre the perfect length for booties i love the rise and the denim feels amazing so soft mine havent stretched more than a normal jean in fact they may have stretched less than others ive had and i can wear then multiple times before washing with their shape being in tact,1
12735,This little jacket is so soft and perfectly lightweight the color goes with everything more money than i wanted to spend but i am so glad i took a chance and ordered online it is exactly what i was looking for,1
12736,Once or twice a year retailer dons out a true s masterpiece the sweater is sturdy bright and bold quality and craftsmanship are amazing and the fit is tts i cannot wait for the cooler weather to wear this beauty with some skinny jeans,1
12737,It is a beautiful top but runs huge i followed other reviews and ordered a size down hoping it would work but it was totally unflattering i wanted so bad to love it but there was no way i could keep it,0
12738,This bathing suit has everything i especially love the ruching in the waist and the boy short bottom finally the coverage my booty needs ive worn it dozens of times and it still holds its quality and looks brand new i get a lot of compliments every time i wear itthe only drawback is it doesnt dry very quickly after a dip in the pool or the lake it stays wet for hours even when im laying out in the summer heat,1
12739,I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail i normally wear a ml and the medium fit perfect it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist the bottom is flowy i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasnt a surprise but i really wish it came lined no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel its too nice for a cover up,1
12740,Material is thick and warm print is very pretty i received complements from all age groups fits a little boxy but it works,1
12741,These fox tights are so very cute and fun how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over they are warm too these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them they are a real attention getter,1
12742,I ordered this online in a sz perfect fit and very comfortable the side slits make it even more interesting since jeans or leggings will show,1
12743,I have other stevies and these are nothing like them the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny the pants themselves run very small in the waist approx two sizes too small compared with other stevies additionally the cuff is sewn like that in place and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves see how it gapes in the cuff on the model like a rounded bottom that is way more emphasized in real life buyer beware,0
12744,This dress is so cute and comfortable im normally a or and the xs is plenty roomy even though this is a clingy knit the nice cotton under slip hides all the bumps and bulges only worry is whether or not the loose weave will pick and how it will clean but so far i am thrilled,1
12745,I was hesitant to buy this because it is double breasted which isnt my first choice that was the least of the problems with this jacket i love sparkle and i love beautiful detail none of the elements by themselves was a problem the sum of the parts didnt work though the end result was an unflattering confusing mess the silhouette plus the frayed edges plus the sequins plus the vent in back plus the huge buttons plus the double breast plus the zipper were just too many things to go t,0
12746,This skirt is great a classic the little dots on the skirt give it some character while remaining a simple black and flattering skirt the material lays nicely and flat it does not make me look like i have a stomach the skirt fits tts i am a little afraid that the waistband will stretch out over time so i might exchange it for one size smaller overall i love the skirt,1
12747,I purchased this jacket on pure impulse to be quite honest it reminds me of a coat my dad used to wear and i was halfway on the way to retailer when i decided to try it on my goodness its perfect its slightly oversized delightfully s and makes everything look good skirts pants dresses etc buy it especially off the s have a special place in your heart,1
12748,But it just doesnt measure up first the sliplining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on either stepping into it or pulling it over your head and once on the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky unfortunately i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately the material is really cute but the dress isnt worth the price effort,0
12749,I got this in the floral print before it sold out and i have never received so many compliments on a dress it hangs so nicely and is so flattering the neckline doesnt bother me at all i know some reviewers mentioned that but i am a very small busted woman so maybe it has something to do with that i find it super comfortable like wearing a nightgown i am so in love with this dress i just ordered it again in black it will be a summer staple i found it runs true to size im p,1
12750,Got this for my daughter who lives out of town i plan on bringing it to her during my next visit i love it the style is up to date and pretty its a perfect dress for almost any occasion im hoping it will fit her but the sizing looks right to me and the quality is great,1
12751,I just tried these on today in the store im and found that they were definitely the right length for heels the inseam is correct however i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats these are super cute jeans,1
12752,My stylist brought me the regular xs to try on in the store and almost told me i should buy it the length seemed just fine but i usually get petite so decided to order the xs petite before deciding good decision there is less fabric in the skirt so it seemed anyway so i am less overwhelmed buy the skirt the cut is super flattering and length was actually better the longer sides hit me around the knee i wasnt sold on the dolor as i have pale skin but there is enough dark to com,1
12753,I bought this yesterday in store in the red color normally i wouldnt spend this much money on an everyday dress but there was no way i could walk out of the store without it the fabric and fit are amazing the dress has a chicness about it that makes you look completely put together but doesnt make you look like you are trying too hard perfect balance of comfort and style im seriously thinking i need it in black as well,1
12754,They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase ive washed them once and wear them a few times a week so theyre certainly not worn out ive never had a pair give out even close to this early i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings the color is lighter than pictured i paid full price the most ive ever paid for jeans because id heard good things about jean shop quality even at sale p,0
12755,This little pantie is fun and playful its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me im a small lass but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly,1
12756,I know this is supposed to look oversized and i own a few oversized ponchos but this takes oversized to a whole new level i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric i do not think sizing down would have made a difference if you are looking for that it seemed like good qualify,0
12757,No this is one of the most unflattering things ive ever put on my body im a very wellproportioned hourglass i tend to wear a small despite a booty and d chest this made me look huge dont do it,0
12758,I purchased this sweater in a small nothing on the web site states it has dolman sleeves it looked sloppy and made my bust disappear it went back i hate dolman sleeves,0
12759,This is a beautiful top the pattern reminds me very much of mola designs stitched in panama i love the contrast of the red stitching against the white background im not as crazy about the buttons on the back sides not sure what that detail adds to the piece it is a boxy shape so be aware its not going to hug the figure the cotton is soft and medium weight overall its a standout,1
12760,I just tried these jeans on out of the box and they fit like a dream im lbs and the petite my usual size fit me exactly right as fulllength skinny jeans they taper perfectly no hemming required they are super comfy and nice and thick they feel durable and high qualitytwo suggestions for improvement i wish is that they were a uniform dark blue wash but the fadng and whiskering is barely noticeable i also wish theyd place the butt pockets a little higher especia,1
12761,This blouse was exactly what i was looking for perfect for those last balmy days of summer fabric a bit sheer but it flows beautifully and the pleating details and higher neckline make this top truly stunning it is very flowy so if youre looking for something more fitted this might not be for you,1
12762,I was in the store looking specifically for long sleeved tops that are cute and found this pretty color pinky purple and my usual xs is perfect im lbs b love thisdefinitely unique and feminine andnonary a smell in the mix,1
12763,The style was really cute but the fit was huge i ordered an xs i dont think going to the xxs would have helped i ended up returning it,0
12764,This is a gorgeous piecethe pattern and color combination are classic fall the sleeves for a xss are slightly short i am but the rest of the fit is great with the type of fabric and ponchostyle i would recommend wearing something underneath,1
12765,Such pretty pattern and colors pleased with dress,1
12766,This dress is a potato sack from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird and its huge on me so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not also the fabric is strange not at all what i expected im so sad i was really excited about this dress,0
12767,Im obsessed with the perfect leather look coated jeans i have another high end denim brand in black i may like these better they fit perfect maybe a tad bighigh enough so potential bottoms shows when bending perfect stretch not to leathery looking just enough the ties at ankle are different i would love these in black but this color is awesome and this cut very flattering for reference im a bottom smaller waste bigger booty size fit perfect,1
12768,Very unflattering and no shape or flair lots of extra material but no swing or shape do not recommend,0
12769,This top makes me feel like the artist i am its so beautifully embroidered and detailed i wear it with cords or jeans and it never gets boring it was worth every penny,1
12770,Very comfy and really nice fabric can see myself wearing these a lot im a size and the fit was perfect,1
12771,I originally ordered this blouse to wear for work i was pleasantly surprised that i could wear it casually with jeans fits comfortably and hugs my curves,1
12772,This is a beautiful and super soft cashmere sweater i found it to run large so thankfully i ordered one size down which was perfect im normally xs but the xxs was very flattering still loose and casual but fitted in the waist and arms it is longer in length and hit mid to lower hip on my petite frame the regular was fine but a petite would probably be great the sleeves are nice and long and have a pretty lace stitch detail the cowl is nice not too overwhelming this is so soft and,1
12773,This dress was absolutely gorgeous and beautifully made i ordered a size down as the other reviews stated the dress ran large however it was massive i wanted this dress so badly and mourn that i had to take it back to the store,1
12774,I love love this top its the perfect peplum tee i would get more if this was offered in more color combos the stripes add a cute effect to the tee and its a perfect soft cotton cant say enough about this one,1
12775,I have always bought interesting pretty wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer now the dresses are just retro funky sad to see,0
12776,Alright ladiesthis jacket its even better than it appears online the green anorak fabric has a little stretch to it and is super comfortable because of the stretch i was able to do a large instead of my normal xl but the real show stopper is the fringed sweater it is gorgeous it lays beautifully open or closed and is so soft and warm the design has so much detail to it there is also this amazing tie in back so you can cinch the waist if you want this jacket will look amazing with a,1
12777,These are soft and skim the body the way well fitted undergarments should they do not pinch bind or ride up they coordinate perfectly with the matching bra i am very pleased with this purchase,1
12778,Truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling the pictures online just barely do it justiceif you have an retailer nearby check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person it does not disappoint every year around this time our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress in the years past they have all been different and beautiful but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year this dress is a deep emerald green,1
12779,One of my favorite dresses in retailerfloral prints caught my eye at the first sight so i had been desperate to have itit looks pale on picture but in reality it is brighter than you imagine it would be along with soft floral pretty color i like the design of skirt compared to the front length is longer on the back it fringes nicely so it looks elegant when i walkand the last thing id like to point outbecause of the textile it is quite easy to fold into appr,1
12780,Everything about this dress is just right the hand of the fabric is soft and drapes beautifully the cut is slender but forgiving the length is short enough to be chic but not skimpy and the fringe and hemline keep it from looking like every other denim shirtdress out there i am lb and got an xs i love the versatility tooas a dress jacket under layer withwithout a belt yay,1
12781,Measurements aa waist i historically wear p in jcrew and most retailer brands i purchased a p and it fit well with a little room i really hated that the waistline is almost a dropwaist the ivory brocade panel comes low on the navel so it makes you look shorter than you really arethe most impressive part of this dress is the necklineshoulder i have pretty narrow shoulders so its a quasiboatneck and its quite lovely,1
12782,This is a nice soft shirt that is very comfortable to wear the collar on this shirt makes this more than just a regular shirt although the shirt seems more fitted on the model i found it to run large if you are going for the same look you might want to size down however i like the shirt and am keeping it it is a good thing too because the navy color went fast very nice shirt and a pretty good price too,1
12783,If your looking for something to spice up your wardrobe this is it rich in color and a luxurious soft hand but so much better in person i plan to dress up with a long knit tunic and tights plus over the knee boots or with destructed dark denim and booties i got the burgundy color and may go back for the blue as well this is a staple for many seasons to come,1
12784,I wear jeans so much therefore i love to a variety in color these jeans are so comfortable they are like wearing sweat pants but they truly keep their shape so well i bought the red which is a year around red kind of a bright apple red i will definitely be buying another pair of these ag jeans,1
12785,I love this tshirt i wish it came in tons of other prints very soft almost feels lived in and high quality all the same,1
12786,Buy this dress you wont be disappointed its lovely and can be worn in the summer and easily transition to fall or even winter with opaque tights tall boots and a denim jacket the neckline is unique and stunning demure yet sexy something that can easily be worn during the work day or into the evening i bought my regular size m and it hits just about my knees i dont think this dress runs small at all,1
12787,Looks beautiful in the photo and the color in person is beautiful but it runs so so large that i think even an extra small would be too large for me just for comparison and i wish all reviewers would include this i am and weigh pounds i ordered a medium which a small to medium is my usual size but i ordered the medium because i wanted to have room to wear something under it i could have worn two sweatshirts under this sweater unfortunately i have returned it,0
12788,I saw this online and was pleased they had it in blue at the store the blue is more of a gray but its a great color i tried on the small and my daughter said you look pretty mommy i was sold i love the cascade on the side,1

12790,Soft and romantic i love it just like pictured and i wear a cami under dress up or down,1
12791,I read the earlier reviews on this and though i agree that the photo here does not show how wide and swingy the top is i love it it is so adorable and comfortable i bought the petite s and i am lbs it fit true to size in the shoulders the petite hits just a few inches below my waist so you might want to keep that in mind if you do not want it to be this short the sweater part is soft not itchy and the poplin sleeves and ruffle are crisp but soft as well because this is very,1
12792,Great quality fit and fashion retailer went back to the days of old with this piece and i am so glad the piece is classic yet modern real statement without going overboard,1
12793,This is a beautiful cardi the cutouts and the full front panels all make it stand out that said there are minor flows imo worthy of mentioning none diminish my satisfaction toward it though the sleeves are slim meaning no longsleeve shirts under it for me at least the fabric is a bit catchy meaning youd better wear something silky or slippery under so the fabric doesnt crumple up behind your back nevertheless i will have so many uses for it last but not the least is my sa,1
12794,I absolutely love these jeans the rise is mid so it is perfect not too low and not too high the embroidered flowers are gorgeous and so unique these pants scream retailerpolgie to me i had to buy them as soon as i saw them because i know they will go fast pilcro denim fits great i ordered these online as my store didnt have them i ordered my normal size and they fit great i have an athletic build and they fit me like a glove with comfy room i cant wait till the temperature gets,1
12795,This is adorable light and breezy i felt it fit true to size leaning on the smaller size of a true fit i am normally an xss and went with the small fitting as it does on the model its a lightweight cotton not a lot of give the v has a tendency to pull and probably will need a securing stitch which was obvious when it arrived from another store i think wearing it with a cami is a great option considering it is flowy on the bottom and it is a thin cotton overall great summer t,1
12796,Im and my usual small fit as with everythingway too long story of my life and i keel a tailor on call,1
12797,These are great jeans and worth every penny they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them i find them to be very figureflattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse even though im petite i ordered a regular in my size because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length,1
12798,I was so excited to try these but was really disappointed in the fit i found the legs and butt to be tight but the waist to be really big if you are normally a size i wouldnt bother with these,0
12799,Color was a perfect match for the linen slacks i wanted to pair it with however the top was way say too big so ill be sending it back,1
12800,The picture does not do it justice this dress is beautiful on it is fitted on the top and flares on the bottom it is also a very soft denim the person helping me at the store brought a sparkly belt that made it even more spectacular truth is it looks great with or without the belt it fits true to size lbs and c and my usual size was great,1
12801,I am absolutely in love with this piece yes it runs large im usually a medium to large in vests ands the small fits me prefectly the quality is superb i love the feel of the faux fur i want to pet it and the snaps and hooks seem as if they will also last forever thank you tracy,1
12802,I ordered this top because it was on a crazy sale and im really glad i did its super soft and comfortable but still very cute so its versatile you can wear it down or dress it up with a great skirt or jacket,1
12803,I bought this skirt for an end of summer caribbean party the floral detail is even more fun in person it looks great with a red top or black tank,1
12804,I have a pair of mih jeans that are the only jeans i own that i absolutely love everything about them this jumper looked versatile useful and fun so i splurged during the off dress salemy experience with mih is that the sizing runs true or european and thus small i ordered this in a medium and it is gargantuan as well as virtually shapeless it looked horrible from every angle front back and sides i cannot imagine it having more fit even in a smaller sizethe fabric is nice p,0
12805,I watched this dress for quite awhile and when it went on sale ordered it im very happy with the purchase its swingy and fun looks great with tall boots too i said it runs true to size but i bet the size smaller would have been great too just because it is a bit of a looser fit,1
12806,I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slimstraight andor petite figure fitandflare dresses simply will not work for you its the entire purpose behind the flare shape at the hip it will be too large for women without wider hipsthat said i found this perfect for me in every way after having a baby its hard to find a dress that fits my more curvy shape where most of my weight fell on the hips and bust i wish this dress was a tad long,1
12807,Very unique cute top i had to order up a size as i thought it ran a little on the small size,1
12808,I tried both the xs and s in the store i am usually an xs but ended up buying the s because the xs was really short and i didnt want it to be any shorter after washing the s fit more like a normal tshirt although the back is longer love the color blue and the fabric is super soft also happy that its not too thin nor seethrough,1
12809,The quality of this top is quite high it feels like silk the print is lovely showy without being too over the top i love it and would highly recommend it,1
12810,Just got this dress in the mail yesterday and i love the style and fabric soooo much the fabric looks kind of shiny in the photos so i wasnt quite sure however in person its a perfect blend that can easily be dressed up or down sadly i cannot fully see how it looks on me because the bust of it is way too small i normally wear a or in a dress and am a c but the inside panel that you cannot see in any of the photos is very fitted to the chest and i cannot even zip the size over my,1
12811,I have had this dress in the shopping basket on my retailer app and was dying to try it on in the store luckily newbury street in boston had it so i stopped by yesterday the dress is everything i hoped and even better the cut could not be more flattering to get the nice classic fit in the front i stayed true to my usual size but worried the buttons would be straining like another reviewer said as soon as the bow in the front is tied it keeps everything together and is very comf,1
12812,This tunic is a casual comfy yet stylish piece that is a great addition to my wardrobe the only thing i find might be an issue is the thin material i tried wearing a tank top under it but the material is too thin and the outline of the tank was too noticeable and looked odd removed the tank and all was good pairs great with leggings,1
12813,The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin kind of scratchy hasalmost no give to it it is very uncomfortable on is very restricting as far asmovement is concerned cannot recommend back it goes,0
12814,I wore this dress to a baby shower it fit nicely and i received many compliments i liked the weight it flowed while walking and it was quite sweet,1
12815,First ive been in love with this dress for months when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it im and pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium its more generous than i expected and wonder if i couldve even gone with a small i might try a belt either way im very very happy with the dress the sleeves are not too long and i didnt get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt the lining makes,1
12816,The top is adorable and i love it however the pink is not pink but more of a very faded orange color i was really hoping for pink but the shirt is a keeper,1
12817,I have had my little eye on this dress since it came out lucky me i found it sitting pretty in my local retailer lost found it runs a tad big when i first tried it on with the sleeves offtheshoulder i was disappointed in the length past my knees but i tried it on again with the sleeves sitting on my shoulders so so darling,1
12818,This skirt is really cute and very comfortable i can dress it up for work or dress it down for casual fun color too,1
12819,This cardigan is a beautiful not too thin but soft and versatile the cutouts add a nice unique detail i was worried that the cuts might fray but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices,1
12820,I bought this top to have so that i can pair it with a lot of my other wardrobe pieces the top is amazing it is soft great fabric a cute cut and can be styled in so many ways definitely worth the buy,1
12821,So disappointed in the abundance of polyester fabrics that retailer carries these days especially at this price point the pattern and style of this dress is beautiful but i will never spend two hundred dollars or even half that on a poly dress please add more linen cotton and silk,0
12822,This top has a bit of a retro flare but so adorable on looks really cute with a pair of faded boot cut jeans,1
12823,I was looking for the full legged pants with a slit light enough for the beach they have my size finally im a regular and m worked well for me cant wait to wear these with a nice top,1
12824,Super flattering dress love it makes my waist look tiny great fit and flare style without making me look pregnant i love the fabric will be great as a travel dress packs easy doesnt need to be ironed really substantial fabric love it i think it runs large since im rarely a at retailer but i find that maeve runs all over the place im usually a at retailer and i got a in this,1
12825,I got this skirt in the dove grey which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you cant see in the photo the other layer is the grey netting it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should im the skirt looks just as it is pictured i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit very very pretty and well made im happy with the purchas,1
12826,Love this vest it does run large so definitely size down im lbs and i ordered the xs which is roomy around the mid section but i think thats the style as the shoulders hit where they should it is such a fun and unique piece i cannot wait to wear it with tights or black leggings with boots,1
12827,This would have been cute if it was more fitted i am and lbs and the small was too wide i didnt try the xs because the small was almost too short in the sleeves and so was the length,0
12828,I ordered this dress to wear to a mid summer evening wedding i love it i think it will be fun and it is unexpected for me i will need to order a smaller sizei am and almost always wear a in retailer wear this ran a little big on the top i will be ordering a and sending one back,1
12829,Within washings the color faded to a not so black black like a pair of pants that has been washed over a years use after or so washes the hook and eye closure began to fall off the pants fit well albeit a bit short im and they run small i sized up to a when i usually am between a or i let the hem out sewed the hook and eye closure back on and redyed them and now they are good to go but for nearly i dont expect to have to do this much work these are not my first,0
12830,Ordered this dress online and wasnt sure about the crisscross neckline feature but i love it its absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too baggy or frumpy the embroidery is beautiful im wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots but it would also look great with flats heels or booties totally in love with this dress,1
12831,This dress has a really elegant neckline combined with the wide fitted waist and underthebust gathers which really flatter the body i have a fairly straight body and this dress gives me shape i usually wear xspetite but the turquoise didnt come in petite and that was my preferred color so i tried the xxs which i could barely get on and off but once on it fit fine aa waist hips id probably be better off with the xs the length of the regular on me was fine like a normal ma,1
12832,I was out of town when my coat arrived and was so excited to get home and try it on i havent worn it yet but weve now got the weather for itand i cant wait im and heavier than id like but the xl fit perfectly,1
12833,This coat is super cute and flattering i am ampampampampampampampampquot and it comes almost to my knee on the back iampampampampm usually a small but got the medium in case i wear a bulky sweater underneath comfy and warm but wonampampampt be warm enough when winter hits without a big sweater underneath great to throw on to walk the dog or hit the bus stop in style,1
12834,I loved the colors of this vibrant dress the beading is fabulous the dress does run small i sized up one size i wore it out and got a lot of compliments,1
12835,Bought the redwhite normally a size small but they were out so tried a medium it fit perfectly and feels amazing love how it hangs and know i will get lots of compliments on this jeans white linen pants very versatile how this can be warn,1
12836,I ordered the blue version of this dress thinking the accent stripes were black they were not they were wine colored i liked the color but not in combination with the other colors in the dress black would have been a better look i had to take it back sad,0
12837,Absolutely love this dress i saw it online and didnt give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing the photos really do not do it justice the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person i agree that if you dont want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress got this for fallwinter in fl and cannot wait to wear it perfect holiday party dress,1
12838,I love good flowy blouses and like the over sized look but this one didnt wow me i thought the quality was just ok it didnt flatter me i almost liked it but i didnt im glad i tried it on because looking at the pics online i thought id like it way more than i did just not great,0
12839,I tried this on as a fluke i work at retailer and like to see the fit of everything so i can talk about it with customers it is so chic it makes your butt look amazing i tried it on with nude booties but i could also see it with a great heeled sandal or flats dont overlook this beauty,1
12840,Love how this fits length is great so i didnt need to hem you wouldnt be able to flattering on muscularathletic legsbottom i bought in navy and then had to buy it in another color it fit so well,1
12841,If you know oneseptember and you know whats good for you then size the heck down maybe even two sizes if your particularly slim or want the dress to fit tighter any way this dress is simply scrumptious the embroidery at the bodice is so detailed and pretty the layers are light and soft like silk but its rayonpoly and the sleeves are sheer and voluminous i actually prefer the sleeves rolled up because they are too long neckline features a slitv with two hooks to close if wanted co,1
12842,I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics most of which are heavy brocades this is so pretty and fun the print is playful and colors are gorgeous and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight i love the bit of beading and that i can dress it up or downi am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan but i know that i will wear this one for years i did get a petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer s swallow me this i,1
12843,I love the look of this sweater but just bought and put on at home and noticed pea sized holes in fabric near arm holes but not on seams not sure if i bought this way and did not notice or if fabric is just incredibly delicate will try to repair but scated this will not hold up look it over carefully before you buy they kind of look like moth holes,0
12844,Smooth to the touch and body skimming this dress drapes over my figure flaws without drawing attention its a great base layer for many accessories and outfits i love this fabric dolan uses i already own the sleeveless and cap sleeve versions of this dress i would love if retailer would sell me a long sleeved maxi or midi version im and purchased size m regular in green,1
12845,If you like a slightly heavier nonclingy basic tee this is it i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter rotating colors and ive been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them the colors are great fabric is quality and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare,1
12846,Was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes it fits perfectly and so happy that it doesnt fall too long looks great with a longer cardigan sweater very happy with this find,1
12847,This is probably a blouse for curvy women with that i mean large breasted i am a d and the xl fits well and the cleavage is in the limit of ok for the office the bottom is a little too large but not too long however the fabric feels extremely comfortable and it stretches but it doesnt lose the shape i am tempted to buy more if you are thin you probably need to size down,1
12848,I was a little hesitant about sizing based on reviewsbut my normal small fit perfectly it is a little low cut for workbut with a scarf will be fine i wish it was a bit shorter hits just below the knees on mebut overall great i have a fairly straight body type and think dress probably works best on this type although if you were small on top and curvy on bottom i think this could be cute too for the price point with the sale its definitely worth trying i got the black and whiteand i,1
12849,This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt,1
12850,Good reason to read reviews i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy heavy fabric makes matters worse,0
12851,Love i wish this came in additional motifs hits at hip i have a long torso perfect for high rise skinny jeans and sandals,1
12852,This is a great casual top it is true to size and a light weight cotton blend i am an xxsp which fits me perfectly and the tan and white looks crisp and clean i keep finding myself choosing this top to wear with jeans cut offs and white shorts i am frequently chilly even in the summer and like the long sleeve which i can roll up or keep down i wish i bought the other two colors before they sold out in my size,1

12859,I was so excited to purchase this dress i love all shades of grey for winter clothing i love knits and i have loved other maeve dresses however i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designedit fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dressfor reference i am slender and smallboned but also curvy hourglass my bust is c hips about i normally wear a small in maeve dresses maybe its j,0

12862,I have vowed to only purchase highwaisted bottoms from here on out because they are just more in line with my style these shorts did not disappoint i love that theyre versatile enough to wear with a cute top wedges or with a tshirt and flats great find i got my normal sz which is usually a tight fit these zipped up perfectly though,1
12863,I really love this this dress but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waistit is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin topsbulgesi would have loved this if the belt went all the way around one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i,1
12864,I love everything about this top it is high volume and looks good with either a skinny pant or a structured voluminous pant very sharp but feminine and frilly look i love the juxtaposition,1
12865,I did buy these when they were off the sale price well worth it they are comfortable thick but not too warm they are my nice home pants to wear outside i love them i got a large and they fit on the baggy side but not bad im usually a large or xl,1
12866,This is the perfect summer top super lightweight but with a little swing in it so it is not tight across the hips the bright colors go with almost anything and the detailing at the top makes this dressier than a regular shirt great with skirts and jeans,1
12867,I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person store pick up i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale hte color is really gorgeous and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size bummer no petite i decided to jkeep it though because as i said it matvehd everything my ejans pants and the skirts i waas trying on of which i kept all oops,1
12868,I stumbled upon this as a return to our store at first i was a little put off by the change in stitching to add support and shape but once you put it on its perfect its very flattering and very comfortable there are snaps in the crotch but i wore it for a full day hours and had no discomfort if there were more colors id buy them all lol,1
12869,Wonderfully soft fabric and gorgeous pattern the background color is a more standard gray than shows in the online photo which looks more pinkish gray on my screen but its just lovely looks perfect with jeans or a skirt i will be wearing this a lot this fall and will keep a lookout for additional patterns,1
12870,What a let down the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured based on the original price point i envisioned a beautiful handknitted sweater made of high grade yarn wool that i could use for travel instead i received something that is grossly oversized for xss made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom not the quality i expected from retailer back it goes,0
12871,I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it and i am so happy i did the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fallwinter but it isnt overwhelming or overpowering fit is oversized as is in any poncho style sweater but it doesnt feel boxy or unflattering if in between sizes definitely go down i like things oversized and i went with the xss and it fits great this will be a go to piece for many years to come,1
12872,I saw this in the store it is definitely something i had passed over on line it is so flattering on i bought in ivory then immediately ordered the grey online,1
12873,I love this shirt and although it is see through a tank works great under it to wear to work the buttons on the back are sewn on really well and it comes down far enough is not too short i am about and pounds the was tight on my neck so i kept a otherwise the would have fit fine since its a blousy shirt and would not have been too tight in the shoulders or armpits,1
12874,I coveted this blouse for weeks and finally pressed go during the recent sale it is truly lovely the textured silk and its lining combine to give this blouse the weight it needs to flow perfectly when untucked it is ashaped and fuller at the hem when tucked it is neat as a pin the colors are almost metallic and it looks as if the flowers have been painted on this is an elegant casual look with white jeans and heels or ive dressed it up with a black pencil as well as a skirt almost ide,1
12875,I cant describe my love for this sweater simple to go outfit paired with jeans and boots its an easy goto sweater in a pinch on a cold day i have sensitive skin so i wore a tank underneath and was fine loved getting this sweater with the extra sale price i purchased the medium and it was tts,1
12876,I love an all cotton shirt feels great and has a bit of quirky styling without being over the top,1
12877,This dress is much larger in person than it looks on the model but i absolutley love it there is an inner tie that helps taper the waist a bit and the material is gorgeous,1
12878,I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on despite the store only carrying this in petites i tried it on anyway and didnt want to take it off its very wearable and comfortable the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely im lbs and c i typically wear a and bought this in a p the length waist and bust fit perfectly,1
12879,Just received this beautiful jacket of quality wool and superior design i love it and wore it christmas eve with tailored black pants the fit is perfect in the shoulders sleeve length and generous in the hips waist i used the tie to gather it in a bit at the waist but plan to have an inch or so taken in on either side at the hip to avoid my looking too wide a matter of preference but i have most things tailoreda must at my age i felt young and attractive rather than old and nondescri,1
12880,The smocking is beautiful the fabric is soft and flowy it is not too sheer for work the blouse fits tts i have this in colors and take the xs and have even bought the xxs for reference i am a b and lbs it is a nice layering length and is not boxy the armholes fit nicely i wish they still had the blue,1
12881,This dress is so pretty i loved the details on it the material was ok would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering unfortunately it did not fit me right im c and the p fit ok it hit just above my knees so the length was fine what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back im so sad cause this is a really pretty dress you can dr,1
12882,This dress is a beautiful classic i am size fits perfectly,1
12883,The dress arrived with a few snags and the fabric already pilling the fabric will only get worse with wear return cute concept poor fabric quality,0
12884,I was nervous about buying this without trying it on but i followed the size chart and wasnt disappointed its flattering thanks to the fitted upperhalf and the forgiving peplum bottomhalf overall its thin light and airy,1
12885,Love this lbs thin arms the xs fits perfect its very flattering and has a boho vibe bc of its length the arms are a little snug but in a very flattering way havent worn it enough yet to experience any pilling but crossing my fingers the cream is a really pretty pale oatmeal color imo the grey is a blackgrey speckled look,1
12886,This top is perfect im and a medium build and its hard to find tops that have long enough sleeves this is really long i love the weight of the fabric perfect under a coat and heavy enough for cool texas winter days the fabric is really soft and the color is a blueish grey the style is feminine but not too girlie its my new go to top,1
12887,Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didnt use the dryer disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it,0
12888,I am going on a trip to south africa in may and needed pants that were cute durable yet comfortable and not frumpy these are definitely the ones i was looking for the fit is great not too tight and not too baggy i got them in three colors and all of them match what is on the site i definitely recommend these chinos as you will be able to wear them to lots of different places dressed up or down,1
12889,The fabric is very comfortable and softlove it great fitttswould recommend,1
12890,Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was,0
12891,I love my new blazer the material is very soft and comfortable and very nice quality but not too wooly to wear into spring the cut is very flattering and the patterns and fringe details are very eyecatching i am and usually wear a size s in retailer and this small fit perfectly they greycream color combo is gorgeous and looks very versatile and can be dressed up or downthe one alteration i suggest is moving the button at the shoulder it gives a wide boxy shape my tailor wil,1
12892,I saw this in the store and fell in love with it i normally wear between a and in pants and the medium fit great it is a very generous cut in the leg and the waist has an elastic band in the back im and the pants almost graze the top of my foot perfect for sandals if i had seen this stock photo first i would have been totally offput by the culotte length but i guess thats what it looks like on a model there are cute buttons that run down the outside length of the pants and t,1

12896,Have only tried on but it is a very cute skirt and i think will be comfortable to wear i love the texture of the material i do wish it came in other colors it is a little heavier material but not too much,1
12897,I love this top i got it thinking id wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more it pairs great with cutoff shorts white jeans denim jeans i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also untucked for a more casual look i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it very happy with it,1
12898,My usual size was a bit large and baggy in most areas but the bust was sooo soo small the button popped and i had barely moved do not recommend this one for anyone with a bust the detailing is very pretty though for someone that can make this work,0

12900,I was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own she knows a lot of what i own it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish the cut is also flattering though i think ill have to wear a strapless bra color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan i purchased the regulr tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much i am lbs,1

12904,This top fits tts as shown on model loose flowy but the cutdetailsflounce still give some nice shape i usually take a s or m at retailer depending on the stylemake went with the small in this i am narrow shoulders ruler shape dd no gaping in the front fits gracefully flows with details that are classic and add the wow factor to this social or work appropriate top so complimentary it would flatter many body types the neckline is juuuuussst right i fasten the top button to make,1
12905,I cant believe how small this thing runs beyond small its almost insulting because the dress is just so gorgeous you really want it to work but theres no way its going to when the l is actually a s so sad to return this beauty,0
12906,This is a very flattering blouse gorgeous detail with the beading,1
12907,I wouldnt be so unhappy if these pants cost about less they are so cheaply constructed one wash and theyre all but guaranteed to shrink the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer they are also inch inseam not as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them,0
12908,I think i wanted a skirt like this in the s with its aged denim and retro style it looks like ive had it all that time i couldnt zip my usual but the is comfortable if a bit snug sitting right at my natural waist its flattering and shows off my waist with tops tucked in something i never do with my other skirts which all sit lower i like how it flares a little oddly due to the horizontal seam its interesting and different i will wear it in summer with sandals and it will lo,1
12909,This sweater runs oversized very soft and comfortable and colors are spot on for fall love the sleeve length,1

12913,This is the perfect tank for everyday but it looks like youve dressed up a bit i love the flow and the ruffles and it looks super cute with a pair of skinny pants really comfortable and it is good quality,1
12914,Ag jeans have become my favorite and these didnt disappoint ridiculously comfortable i think they run a tad big but maybe not enough to size down just enough to where ill need to wash them more often maybe,1
12915,These cords are seriously fantastic worth the price indeed they are very comfy have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop they do run big i got a and im usually a they are also very long nothing a little trip to tailors cant fix overall highly recommended,1
12916,This dress is beautiful on is thin enough to be extremely comfortable being curvy it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional,1
12917,This skirt is about an inch longer on me than on the model in photo im ft ordered petite but the length actually works i have a bit of a tummy so ordered size fits great really love the colors so many tops will go with this skirt so it will be easy to vary the look,1
12918,Love it i usually wear a small but i just went to our local store and they only had a medium i tried it on just in case and it fit perfectly it is sitting pretty in my closet now so if you are a size small try ordering a medium and i hope it works for you as well,1
12919,I love this dress im and its just long enough to be dramatic and graze my feet without dragging on the ground with flat sandals the print is lovely and the beading is subtle as some have mentioned the neck is high its definitely noticeable but i didnt find it uncomfortable,1
12920,I cant wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel i especially love the detail at the pocket edges very well made the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable this will go great with denim and long skirts the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but thats okay this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so its nice to be able to wear a bit of,1
12921,Not sure who this is for but its not for me skirt was long stiff and puffy on my hips i could not get it to lie correctly maybe you have to be to pull this off,0
12922,Beautiful colors lovely style feminine and has a nice flow fiattering fit in back also nice holiday blouse really very pretty,1
12923,I cannot even tell you how many pairs of white jeans i have tried on in my quest to find white jeans all brands and all styles and finally i took a chance on these and have found the ones these are great quality as true for any ag pants i have ever purchased they are a crisp white and are not see through and the fit is amazing i have athletic legs and with my muscular thighs and calves it has been difficult to find a pair of white jeans that didnt hug to tightly and therefore fitting poorl,1
12924,Cute shirt i thought from the model that it would be big so sized down its more snug than i expected so will send back and reorder in normal size might order size up and compare,1
12925,Bought this top in white and blue motif it fits me great and looks adorable the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but its an easy fixthis top looks great dressed up or down would definitely recommend,1
12926,I bough this dress in blue and i cannot tell you the compliments and the looks i get on the street no kidding this is a beautiful dress which has a very feminineromantic quality to it i bought size and it sits perfectly on my waist i completely fell in love with that dress and especially with the lace work and the design this is a classic piece that is always going to be timeless in my opinion no regret at all to have bought it,1
12927,I ordered this top because it was percent cotton and a cute design when it arrived i thought it was a cute different top uniquely designed when i tried it on it looked like a had several extra rolls due to the ruching and was very unflattering it reminded me of the michelin man wearing extra tires and i am of a thin build so i did not like the perception of rolls throughout the bodice unfortunately it did not work for me i wish retailer would include more cotton tops in their collect,0
12928,So i tried on the regular size in the store and love the top but looked too big on mecolor is gorgeous and rich the sheer adds a little whimsical to it and i love the tieneck trend of lately would go nicely with jeans skinny or flare or trousers not sure about a skirt though,1
12929,This dress is incredible i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it i bought it in the navy color its gorgeous in person very bright vibrant colors i am c bra inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out and got it taken in a bit i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads if youre thinking about buying this dress do it you wont regret it,1
12930,Love this topperfect under a jacket for work or on its own for date night i have a long torso and the length is perfect so dainty and different,1
12931,Im and bough a size regular this is so short that if you wear with jeans you can see a midriff cute pattern but im returning it,0
12932,Wonderful flattering fit mostly cotton so very cool and huge color selection i bought pair thrilled with pilcro only thing that could make these better would be if made in the usa cuffs roll down if you want less sun,1
12933,I happened to see someone purchasing this top in the green at my local retailer store and the sales associate told me they had just gotten then in and they were already almost gone they only had one left in size s it fit but was a bit too long for me so they ordered the sp for me its perfect the color says turquoise but its actually more of an emerald green its a bright saturated color much more beautiful than the online photo i have green eyes and love the way it brings them out it,1
12934,This is a sweater i love to look at and wear for any occasion it looks on me almost exactly like the model picture in the online photo im i bought a small and it fits very loose and comfortable i would suggest size smaller than usual would fit well i usually wear small for tops and medium dresses it is great to layer with a brown or rusty copper large cardigan it has a somewhat southwest blanket look with its colors of soft apricot and soft brown plus turquoise stripe it dresse,1
12935,I ordered an xsp online which is my usual size and it fit perfectly its that unique and cute kinda piece you expect from retailer if youre going to wear a tshirt might as well still have a little detail and style,1
12936,I bought the black and love it i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium it was plenty roomy im and about fluctuate between lbs i usually wear a medium or large in retailerwear but i like things roomy have to hide a little extra these days,1
12937,The picture doesnt do this justice this top is amazing in person i purchased my regular size it is very versatile and the colors are perfect as well as cut and material worth the money,1
12938,I love this dress the quality of the material is very nice good weight and softness the dress hides my baby belly and feels really comfortable on i got tons of compliments when i wore it,1
12939,It was the color that prompted me to take this dress to the fitting room as seen in the photos it is a deep burgundy or dark maroon though the color is deep and rich the design of the dress makes it lighter and easily able to be worn during the heat of the summer in the later months of summer and early fall i will wear this dress without leggings for a transitional look when the temps cool down though i will wear leggings or tights throughout the winter with the dress it will easil,1
12940,Totally see through,0
12941,Cute jeans flattering and slimming tts the cut of the top makes my butt look flat but oh well they are super comfy they are not as short on me as they look on the model im,1
12942,This is the second of the new dress batch i have purchased and it is lovely this catalog shot does not do it justicethe colors are brighter but not neon lots of indigo and coral there is a tad of yellow the bodice makes my aa size look much more the bodice fits me perfectly as the top pleating is flat the v neck is just right not too low and the back is even prettierthe dress just fell gracefully out of the package without a wrinkle and without a mussed pleat that was a sh,1
12943,This cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so its a winwin it hangs a little boxy so ill need to figure out how to style it so its more flattering the pockets are a pretty gold color you can see it from the inside and adds a nice touch of color its a keeper,1
12944,I have been wanting this coat ever since i tried it on in the store a month ago its beautiful and wellmade it fits tts but a snug tts so if you are between sizes i would order up grab this asap while the price is right and it is still available,1
12945,This dress is gorgeous and perfect for holidays unlike other byron lars dresses that have some stretch to them this dress is fitted and has no give i typically wear a size lbs c but in chest the was too tight i could zip it but could not breathe lol i sized up to and the fit is true perfection,1
12946,Absolutely love this cardi its perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants i am nearly tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length it adds warmth but its breathable so it doesnt give you the super hot effect when going inside they only reason i gave a in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things otherwise it is a great addition to my closet,1
12947,Love this top the material is light soft and comfortable one thing to note it runs very large this feature is perfect for me as i was worried it would be too tight around the middlethis style would not look good if it didnt fit looseso i was pleasantly surprised to see that it fit me with plenty of roomsomething i need for my full figure if you are trim around the middle i recommend going down a size or two,1
12948,I have been looking for a skirt like this and love this one it does sit a little high on your waist but i like that and think its more flattering at least on me it is i marked that it runs try to size but may run a tiny bit on the larger size i usually wear a but a fit great and its been a long time since ive worn a,1
12949,This top looks fantastic on definitly great when you want to look a little more dressed up the fabric is a bit sheer so i will wear a nude camisole underneath the design has the perfect amount of shimmer to make it dressy it is so silky and feels great on the neckline has the perfect plunge too,1
12950,I love this tee i got the navy color and the quality is good its a light and soft linen that is opaque i cant vouch for the other color though its a very loose fitbut its not boxy and the sleeves are still well fitted and comfortable instead of gaping or huge im very short and the xsp comes to my hip im almost tempted to get the other other in regular just so i can tuck it with skirts and pants too the only issue i could see is that because the neck is a bit wide it might show,1
12951,This dress is so easy to wear the neck line is not too low can wear a regular bra it flows beautifully i love it,1
12952,Im surprised by the negative reviews and im here to come to its defense i love this dress im solidly a petite in tracy reese and this fit perfectly the top isnt snug but its not roomy enough to say it runs large just perfectly comfortable the belt was a little tricky because it has to thread through several loops but it stays put nicely and fit perfectly without being too snug or uncomfortable the fitted top with the belt offsets the fit and flare style of the skirt lace is beauti,1
12953,I initially liked the feel and quality of the top but once it was on it was much shorter and looser than the picture of the model it flowed out from my chest with one central pleat in the front and my husband said it made me look pregnant then came the tedious task of taking it off with such a snug fit in the shoulders im regularly a size xs d and lbs and both size and did not work for me,0
12954,I really like this blouse a lot very very easy to wear i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend very flattering and great blue color very happy with this purchase highly recommend i am short torso and my usual worked,1
12955,I purchased the dress with the bowback shift in peach because i loved its nautical theme pattern when i recurve do the dress i found it to be stiff and boxy being a petite shortwaisted person the top portion of the stress hung on my body awkwardly my bra strap was showing in the back and the dress needed to be pulled up about inches to properly sit on my frame i returned the dress,0
12956,After reading the previous review i was pretty confident in ordering this dress it arrived in the mail today and i was so disappointed first of all its huge the medium was way too big on me and im never a small at retailer i even considered ordering the large in this my normal size at retailer second the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo and the fabric felt cheap finally it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didnt fit right,0
12957,First the good parts these are adorable in person and i think the colors are prettier in person than in the pictures the green isnt too army green its a pretty nice mellow neutral that you could wear with reds whites blues pinksvirtually any colorthe tencel fabric is super soft and comfortable and the drape is nice they do seem to run a little large so id size down if youre between sizesand now sadly the bad these stretch out virtually an entire size after just about a,0
12958,This is a gorgeous sweater i purchased it in black and purple,1
12959,Best jeans ever its so hard to find a good petite jean you shop and shiop and then pay more to get them altered the fit and length on these are perfect love love love,1
12960,I so wanted this skirt to work love the design but its way way too long i am lb and the small is inch on the floor i step on the skirt as i walk,0
12961,The fun colors drew me to this but it sure fit weird the top was fine but it became a bit tentlike in the waist the material doesnt feel great either,0
12962,I was on a mission at retailer to find a versatile and comfortable jacketcardigan this is perfection the detail and pattern in the wool make it unique and the zipper and snaps are great quality i bought it in the green and is great for the office and out in jeans as well,1
12963,I love clothing that has little surprises and i love the detailing at the arms with the lacelike openings which is not very characteristic and actually quite fancy for a typical henley i found the fabric to be medium weightand thought the quality was fine i like all of the colors this comes ineach would fit into my wardrobe nicely i have gotten into comfortable clothing that is still flattering and functional lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it this top certainly is,1
12964,Classic and stylish trendy with the blockingrich colors soft and comfy i typically wear s and s was perfect i love this sweater,1
12965,My husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on oohs and aaaahs galore with this one lets let him review this onehe says he loves the vibrant color length and the way the top is perfectly fitted he was impressed with the lining and the mesh at the hem that keeps the flare in the skirt i had to explain that one he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees,1
12966,I own several of retailers kimonos this has to be the prettiest the colors are rich more beautiful in person i cant wait to pair this with jeans shorts this summer,1
12967,Im worried about the quality of the shirt it looks like it may snag easily ive decided to keep it so hopefully i will get some use out of it in hindsight i would have not bought it when considering the price and quality of the shirt,0
12968,I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth and he was right im usually a size so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso but probably not way too much fabric around the midsection its a shame because the fabric was really pretty but too stiff a hand to drape well,0
12969,Note to photographers please dont cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isnt this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed im petite way too much fabric returned,0
12970,This top is adorable on the online picture doesnt do it justice a sales girl in my store had it on and i loved it and had to try it on i got it in xs black i am and lbs it has the perfect drape to it it might be too cool for winter but will be perfect when it warms up a little this was my favorite thing i found in the store in months love it,1
12971,My sister gave me this top for christmas and its perfect i find myself grabbing for it constantly im usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly i wear it with leggings and jeans,1
12972,I love this blazer so much i bought it in both colors im pounds and bought the size which is perfect initially when i tried it on in the store i thought i needed the because it was a little tight in the arms and shoulders the was too boxy on me and im so glad i went with the it stretched especially the arms and fits perfect i love how i can dress this down with a graphic tee and jeans or dress up with a blouse and cropped black pants,1
12973,I bought this for an upcoming lateseptember seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights but not too warm because of the open weave i just received it yesterday and i adore it i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away per one of the other reviews and i was happy that it does up close you can really see the pink but from an arms length away or more it looks beige wi,1
12974,Thanks to the previous reviewer who noted the details and size of the blouse i purchased this blouse its true to size size small fit me perfectly im b waist hips and it even fit my muscular arms and broad shoulders perfectly the color is very rich a wine color some of the jars of jam have berries on it and of course the tassels have spoons at the end the neckline is so perfect feminine yet appropriate for work how cute is that it is a silky material and flows perfectly,1
12975,This robe is so pretty i kind of feel like a movie star when i wear it the embroidered flowers and trim are a very nice touch the fabric is very light and soft im sure it will feel nice and cool on those hot summer nights ahead the fit is true to size and is actually a bit longer than what is shown on the model i am extremely happy i decided to make this purchase,1
12976,I was on the fence about another patchwork design peasant inspired blouse but once i tried this on i fell in love it drapes beautifullly is not too short and just feels pretty for reference i am feet inches lbs b and usually wear a medium in tops the medium fits and flows perfectly hiding all my mature woman problem areasi purchased quite a few items on the off sale and this is one of my top favorites i love the versatility just gorgeous for casual wear or dressy,1
12977,Just bought this dress in a im lbs b in jeans this is so much better than pictured its an empire waist that really flatters my small bust and accentuates the thin part of the waist i have an hourglass figure but can see this working great for pear shapes i wish the material felt softer but the fit was so perfect even for my broad shoulders will transition nicely to warmer weather but for now i plan to wear it with leggings and a cardigan,1
12978,This dress is soft and hits all the right spots the neckline makes it a little alternative which i like,1
12979,Cute enough but i couldnt figure out what to do with the tie that didnt make it look like an extra set of sleeves oddly placed,0
12980,I bought the blue and it is beautiful it definitely runs small and i agree with the other reviewer who stated to order sizes up,1
12981,This coat is awful just awful i bought it based on the reviews my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress it looked awful i really really liked the softness and that it wasnt like another puffer coat it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear but the look style and design make it very unflattering it looked so bad that i took it off right away so disappointing,0
12982,Feminine with beading in front love the neckline and flow nice fall colors sleeves button really nice fit in shoulders if you like this style it is absolutely beautiful on may be short on those with long torsos,1
12983,I liked this top so much that i purchased it in two colors green and wine the top and colors are exactly as pictured online the material feels great and they fit nicely the fit was true to size,1
12984,These tight cords are perfect for fall,1
12985,I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt but it is very pretty with capris,1
12986,I love this jacket i was waiting for it to go on sale and it did but only because of the fitthe style is great and it has a peplum that goes all the way around the back very differenthowever it runs insanely small im not sure where the others are saying it fits true to size it does not typically im a xs or s petite i wear a or a this jacket i needed a in very small across the back,1
12987,Love this striped top its perfect to throw on with black skinnies and a denim jacket or long grey cardigan it also pairs well with camel it is super soft runs big imo even though other reviewers said small like most bordeaux i took an xs whereas i wear a small in most other retailer brands similar to the photo although much looser on me,1
12988,I feel in love with this piece the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments it lifted my mood just wearing it sadly ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear so sad they should recreate this in a heavy fabric,0
12989,I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it i am either an xs or s in antho and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy normally i would have overlooked this shirt as its rather unimpressive on the hanger but it was on sale so i tried it on very cute when tried on it fits well across the shoulders but isnt too clingy in the body which i like the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor,1
12990,These pants are amazing material on the thickerheavier side the pants are very comfortable and very cute for the fall fits perfect,1
12991,I really like this shirt i fell for it after seeing it paired with grey jeans but when i searched the entire website i couldnt find it then a couple of days later it appeared i was super excited and im glad i ordered it i was not disappointed the shirt is soft and long enough to cover my waist area without riding up if i bent at the waist the colors are very vibrant and its quite stylish i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly,1
12992,I usually like coats and wraps with highwaisted belts but this way too high and the fit was really unflattering i can see it being chic on a tall slender person but its definitely not right for my short curvy body returning it today,0
12993,Ive been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it its soft drapes nicely but its not as dressy as silk shirt would be the navy is really blue not a blacknavy like so many ive washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well shrank just a little but that made it perfect for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly oversized boyfriend fit yet it still has shape if you want a fitted shirt go down a size or look for something else,1
12994,This top is a nice piece to transition into fall it goes well with jeans but it could also be dressed up with black pants,1
12995,This is simply the most lovely interesting flattering sweater ever i got the green which is a lovely minty color couldnt be happier,1
12996,I wore this dress on thanksgiving with black tights and black flats and it looked great the dress is forgiving if youre trying to hide a chunky waistline because the belt doesnt go all the way around its just in the front so it gives the illusion of a waistline and doesnt look like just a sack if you have a great waistline you may not like this i wish it were a bit longer but with black tights it looked fine im no where near as tall as the model and it was about above my,1
12997,Another excellent maxi dress by ranna gill usually this brand of dresses tends to run small in the bodice requiring me to go up a size but i found that this dress ran true to size i got a petite as well cause the standard size was a touch too long for me very happy with the color quality and uniqueness of the dress,1
12998,Paige denim has done it again with this version of the hoxton high rise no matter how many times i tell myself that i will find a less expensive pair of jeans i never can find jeans that fit as well and last as long as my paige jeans this is a sleek pair of skinny jeans with the added benefit of being high waisted as a mom who hates always having to worry about spilling over the top of my jeans no matter how thin or fit you are im sorry ladies this problem is real the hoxton high rise,1
12999,These tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit i paired with a mustard mini denim shirt and desert boots they do run small i am a size and had to get the ml,1
13000,Love this dress it is so comfortable and can be worn as casual or dress up,1
13001,I saw this dress online and i ordered immediatelyit has everything i love my fav color a peplum and feminine cut out detailsi ordered my usual size medium and it was too tight in the chest and i am just average cloved it so reordered in a size largeif you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper endof your size medium and i am usually a so needed to go upthe reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med,1
13002,Love the design fabric is very light and flowy i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage runs a little wide size down such a fun top ive had tons of compliments i usually wear a size and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small,1
13003,I ordered this suit online which is something i never do i am and ordered the it fits perfectly it covers up nicely i am small chested a and it has padded cups which enhances my chest the ruching hides any tummy flaws really a slimming suit and great quality,1
13004,This shirt is stunning definitely a shirt for special occasions its more than i would normally pay for a top but it is a really special piece of clothing the fit is slim im and pounds i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes the xxs is just right it is quite sheer so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath,1
13005,I see many uses for this sweater it is so whimsical i love it,1
13006,I love these pants so much and have worn them so many times in a week they are comfy and causal but still chic and presentable these pants run true to size and are great for so many things running errands working out lounging around being casual and cool etc etc etc after buying these on sale and loving them i knew i needed more and purchased two more pairs i definitely recommend these for anyone who wants both comfort and style,1
13007,lbs and i saw this while shopping with my sister who is lbs we both tried on the small and the fit was perfect i didnot need a petite it is so soft and i didnt notice other vests with different fabric from each other at all the vest is just like the photo its cozy collar didnt bother me i wear my top collar out or with a turtleneck i waited until it was on sale because the price was a little high but it is very soft and uniquely special,1
13008,This dress is a beautiful vibrant color and a classic fit and flare fit it does seem to run a bit large i am and lbs and wore a petite it fit nicely and was flattering but still a little roomy i added a beaded belt to dress it up for my maid of honor duties and despite all the running around dancing hugging buckling the brides shoes and holding my children the lace did not fray and the shape held up beautifully,1
13009,This skirt is beautifulthe color is definitely more a greenygold then a true yellow goldnice quality fabric has some stretch big pockets with cute lining buttons are adorable perfect knee length sits higher on the waist because its not lined and the pockets are big the pocket line is visible on my thigh area so i am going up a size just so i dont see thatif you have less curves your regular size should be perfect it has so much character but it,1
13010,I do love this shirt but when it arrived it had makeup around the collar apparently from someone else who had tried it on i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem but it did make for a poor first impression,1
13011,Really great tank fit runs a little small if you are tall,1
13012,Love the muted orange color and the design its lightweight and will be perfect for fall days,1
13013,When this poncho first came online i ordered it in the xss my usual size i was a little disappointed that the point in the front oddly hung low was offcenter the back was centered i returned it when i spotted them at the store recently i tried on a few in the xss to compare see how others hung i found that one of them hung fine in the front centered the back was a little off center which was fine its soft comfy love the soft white color border trim its just perfect,1
13014,I love this dress the fit is great for tall girls im and the length is perfect can be dressed down with cute sneakers or up with heels every time i wear this dress i get a ton of compliments and it is so comfortable,1
13015,This top fits perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a little tight not uncomfortably so but i wish they had just a little more room so they looked like they did in the picture other than that i love this shirt its super cute and comfy and i have gotten a few compliments on it,1
13016,I am superpleased with this cardigan which is at a terrific sale price i saw this in the pink color in the state street retailer in chicago and i loved the feel of the material but wasnt sure about the color for me when i saw they had a neutral striped version online i decided to get it the material is very soft and the beigeneutral color has a gray undertone which is good for my skintone the front is doublelayered and it has a fun seaming detail in the back and an unfinished trim whi,1
13017,I love a dolman the tassled dolman is slimming light and comfortable,1
13018,I tried it on while out of town i was concerned about getting it home but i kept thinking about it i purchased it online once i got home the colors are beautiful its a swing dress with quite a bit of swing this is perfect for me because im sensitive about my mid section i wore mine with in brown sandals my husband said i had legs for days ill take that as a great compliment i usually wear a medium but could have worn the small in this dress i preferred the medium because it w,1
13019,I love this top it is a perfect summer staple but for me it was too short i sized up to fix this problem because i prefer the boho flowy look it is flowy on its own but i felt it lacked length so went up a size waiting for my retailer mail with anticipation,1
13020,This dress is fantastic its super flattering and very versatile for reference i am and lbs and usually a size in retailer dresses the size medium fit perfectly highly recommend this item,1
13021,I agree with the previous review i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store which is hrs from my house the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy the caveat it is quite short i am lbs i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed,1
13022,This dress is absolutely lovely i couldnt leave the store without it even though it was full price and i have a million dresses its just that great i am lbs and bought the small,1
13023,I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer the shirt in our store was featured in all colors i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft i felt like i was wearing a tshirt with an easy on and easy off feel the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit love,1
13024,I love this sweatshirt i truly did not pay much attention to it on line but while in my local store one was returned and it caught my eye immediately as the flowers are embroidered in a nice substantial rope type yarn to give it a more demential effect the torn holes here and there give the appearance of being the most loved garment in your closetand it has become mine along with the jacket with the same embroideryfunny how pieces i did not give a second thought about have become my li,1
13025,This is my new favorite summer dress seriously i purchased this dress while there were no reviews at the time but im so glad a took a chance the colors are pretty close to the picture shown maybe more of a lilac hue than mauve i normally wear a petite or a regular in dresses so i went with a p as other reviewers have mentioned this dress seems to run a little bigger so i could have easily gotten a petite for the shorter length and it still wouldve been flowy i have chosen to,1
13026,I wanted this so much that i purchased it at full price i purchased the light denim in a petite smallthis dress would be flattering on any figure i am an hourglass and it is so flattering on me i am also busty and this dress fits quite nicely as well the material is thicker and somewhat stiff in a positive way it has substance and the detail zipper on the back is different this brand has never let me down the tie doesnt have to look like the one in the picture i made a lose double kn,1
13027,I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful i on the other hand looked awful the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff so the dress didnt move with me it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out then to contribute to the volume the sleeve is not set in it is a raglan style that on me looked more like a bat suit than what i was hoping for a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair also the belt didnt enhance the,0
13028,This dress is everything everyone said it was in the reviews so cute and beautifully made fully linedi felt it ran a bit small as i had to return it for the next size up more so in the bust area but the fit and length was perfect in the size lbs i will say that all the raving reviews made me purchasethe dress without hesitation and im sure glad i did,1
13029,This top is great under a blazer for work can be tucked into a skirt and looks great with jeansnecklaces work great with this neckline unless they are short the sea green is wonderful i like the snug armholes but may be a problem for some my hips are larger than my bust so i had to be convinced to try this on and im glad i was overruled i am a small or medium in retailer tops and i got a small,1
13030,I bought this instore and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online the fabric is soft and drapey making the top lightweight and flowy this is not a fitted shirt and i didnt feel it was overly large so i think it runs true to size i felt fine in an xs t did feel the need to wear a camisole tank with it but i tend towards the modest side i bought it with the widelegged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments i wish id noticed the navy blue,1
13031,One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust g and camouflage my postpartum belly the dress did it all i ordered the large and lbs and it is so flattering it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer like i said best maxi dress ever price is pretty high but it was worth it,1
13032,I ordered two sizes up after reading reviews and added a belt for waist definition it is longi am six feet tall and it is perfect for me this is absolutely beautiful my husband loves the floral print and i received countless compliments after one wear the light flowing material swayed and billowed in the breeze of the outdoor wedding i attended very feminine and enjoyable to wear pricey but i felt i could wear spring through autumn love,1
13033,I love this top it looks exactly like the picture except the sleeves are not full length they are closer to length the color is vibrant and the material is light and comfortable,1
13034,This skirt is beautiful especially the color and looks well made however i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasnt flattering i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this,1
13035,I wore this to my retirement party i wanted something special for a once in a lifetime event i wanted something that was dressy while also being unique so i wouldnt look like everyone else almost without exception from my boyfriend to everyone i talked with mentioned my dress the design is so unique making me feel even more special on my special day its beautiful yet comfortable the stretchy sides made it feel snug without pinching or discomfort really a fun dress to wear im sure,1
13036,I bought this to wear to my winter bridal shower it was a cold day so i turned it into a jumper by pairing it with a silk blouse it is flattering and comfortable great for work and other semiformal events,1
13037,Great sweater for any occasion may be dressed up andor worn with jeans very versatile love that it is short sleeves size is true to fit,1
13038,This looks cute in the web photo unfortunately it is absolutely huge in person i got the small and have to return it because it is not wearable for me,0
13039,I bought this in the olive green and blue a while ago both in the small great jumpsuit and true to size i accidentally washed the blue one in the washing machine in cold but caught it before the dryer it still fits although it seems a bit shorter in the legs,1
13040,Love this top tried on a small in the store as it was the only size the had the sales person ordered me a medium on line i am wearing it tomorrow for my birthday the stretch fabric is very flattering,1
13041,The lilac pic of this shirt doesnt do it justiceit is so darn cute on the band around the waist really draws your eye in and makes your waist look really small love that also the pleated sleeves are just so feminine and pretty the fabric is like a washed cottonvery soft i can see this being dressed up or made really casuali bought the green color and am going to wear it with a chunky turquoise necklace and pencil skirt,1
13042,Love this sweater it can look dressy or just right with jeans now if it will just cool down i can wear it,1
13043,I found these at my local retailer on the sale rack in a moss green color the material cut and overall quality of these gauchos is excellent they will be a nice transition into autumn with a light top and a jacket i got them in size and they fit perfectly highly recommended with the off of sale items they cost tax,1
13044,This is the first romper ive ever purchased and im instantly in love its flows the colors are vibrant and the pockets are practical looking forward to wearing it for the rest of the season as well as next year,1
13045,I would not recommend these pants if you have a curvy or athletic figure these pants seem to be cut straight up and down the fabric is not soft the color is slightly more muted in person and they are not as relaxed as they appear to be on the model,0
13046,I was a little worried this top wouldnt look quite as nice as it does online due to the price but it is super cute in person too tank underneath is attached but does not get in the way great top cannot wait to wear it,1
13047,The model must have this sweater pinned at the back the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything but the fit is at with a long torso and broad shoulders the large was still shlumpy didnt hang right at all bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering my uber fit daughter had the same issue and she usually makes everything that doesnt work for me look amazing returned,0
13048,Love this top i have it in the green and i am tempted to go and buy it in the other colors it is a simple but cute top that is easy and comfortable to wear a little dressier than a plain tee,1
13049,Thus sweater is perfect the fit is exactly as i expected it from other reviews it is super soft and not at all itchy i have worn it over a tank top with jeans and boots as well as to work over a dress the fact that i can wash it is an added bonus i havent dried it yet as i am worried it could shrink i bought this with a discount but it is totally worth full price,1
13050,Love these jeans fit and style the wash is a makes them almost more navy blue than blue jean color but they are soft and fit perfectly another reviewer described them as mid rise but they dont fit me that way at all,1
13051,Despite the mixed reviews i went ahead and bought this in my normal size i am smallchested b and found this to fit perfectly so i understand why those with large chests were finding this impossible to fit at the top the fabric and detail are stunning on this there is not a lot of give to the fabric but if you are smaller in the bust buy it,1
13052,I love this shirt im lbs just had rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length,1
13053,Tried this after missing out on the very similar terra max dress where petite sizes sold out the medium is perfect and the style can be dressed up wore it on a day out and two strangers complimented me on the great dress,1
13054,I loved the cut and the stretch in the material made them comfortable however i found that the material was unflattering for thicker thighs because it tended to cling to the body it would have been better with some sort of lining as it would have prevented the flimsy material from highlighting imperfections bottom of pants are not hemmed so if you want a clean look you may not like the edges these were returned immediately as it just did not work for me,0
13055,Love this shirt looks perfect with a pair of jeans makes the outfit with out any effort,1
13056,Purchased as a gift but needed to return due to recipient weight challenged in past months heavier material of neutral tone with detailing of epaulets pairs well with dresses skirts jeans jeggings and whatever style of boots veratile garment and will repurchase for self in future,1
13057,I recently bought this dress in an retailer store to attend an art museum event the open back created an awkward bra exposure problem which i solved by buying a gabardia camisole by lacausa the same brand and print as the dress the dress is described as casual but it can be dressed up with gold shoes or sandals the retailer saleswoman brought me the dara vegan leather jacket in plum by hei hei to complete the outfit the contrast between the airy dress and the vegan leather was chic and,1
13058,I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors its just so cute flattering so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt ive been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one im so worried if something happens to it lol im weird like that its always the good stuff that cant be replaced,1
13059,This blouse is quite stiff i wouldnt mind the boxiness if this blouse werent so long even if you size down because of the eyelet and the cute hem it would be difficult to shorten this blouse to fit,0
13060,Very comfy can wear the dress both ways the front is a deep swoop neck cut the back is a vneck cut i flipped the dress around to the vneck was more flattering on me due to having a smaller chest got an size,1
13061,I wanted this dress in yellow from the moment i first saw it on instagram i waited for it to be available online and once it was i ordered it i am usually a size medium but sized down to a small petitie and the fit is off i am a b so its too roomy in the chest because i love everything else about this dress i am going to reorder in an xs petite but that will be two sizes down for me not sure if it will fit length was good looks great with a dark denim jacket the dress is li,1
13062,This is a fabulous cardiganjacket i saw it on line and read the great reviews and happened to find one of each color in two different stores i bought them both i have practically lived in them the last week in rainy cool weather the white one goes with everything and the blue one in fabulous with jeans and probably other things as well i have gotten several compliments on them immediately they are just the right weightnot too heavy but heavy enough and a good sturdy quality mater,1
13063,I have long arms and they are not really small and the small fit me well i think the fact that i have broad shoulders made this top work for me definitely a keeper i am surprised that the arms fit me though because i often experience sleeves that are too tight when trying on tops im glad that wasnt the case this time around im lbs depending on my appetite,1
13064,First let me say i love the fabric and the pattern of the blue dress but the fit is extremely loose they could take out an entire inches of material and it would still be a swing dress the photo of the back of the model where the blue dress goes in to her waist is not at all accurate if it was i would love this dress the photo of the model wearing the other color is how the dress actually hangs straight down from the underarms and then bigger as it goes toward the hemline i am,0
13065,Absolutely wonderful they fit like a dream you could dress them up or down ill probably live in these jeans forever,1
13066,I wanted to like this top as the fabric was nice and thick but found that it dipped too low beneath the armpits which would be ok if your lats are in perfect shape but ive always found that cut made mine look a bit saggy and im not heavy not great enough to keep in my opinion,0
13067,I am a huge fan of tracy reese because her dresses are works of art great quality and super wearable for both work and play and this is no exception i purchased this dress in regular xs im b waist hips and it falls right above my knees for the office or more conservative setting i add a belt and a sweater otherwise i wear it alone for a carefree look i chose the regular size because the dress is voluminous and it gets about an inch shorter when i belt it and it looks,1
13068,I loved this top so much that i ended up purchasing it in another color it works with so many different outfits both casual and dressy it is super comfortable and so soft i would definitely recommend it,1
13069,These pants are nothing short of amazing they have a great wide leg with plenty of beautiful flow to them i am months pregnant and can wear them under my bump but they are by no means maternity pants i have only gained lbs they have a nice silky material that will be great for hot summer weather and will be great comfortable travel pants the only downfall is the length i am with long legs and will have to get inches chopped off,1
13070,So there werent any product reviews to go by when i ordered the last small i had no way of knowing if it ran big small or tts im usually a med but to my surprise the small worked due to the fluid pleating it sits right on my natural waistline similar to the model and not too short in length im i also like the med weight of the fabric it moves freely when you walk but not too light it is similar to a double weight georgette or crepe,1
13071,Ive worn this dress to two summer weddings and i couldnt be happier with it this dress is extremely flattering i usually wear a size but i returned the dress for a size which fit perfectly the exact same dress but in a different color was being sold at another major store the other color wasnt nearly as flattering but still cute and the price was comparable,1
13072,Beautiful shirt hits me a little higher im not sure im going to keep it just because i have something similar but its a beautiful top im and carrying a little extra baby weight right now so im an instead of my usual i ordered an and it fit well,1
13073,I love this top i am d ordered a small and it fit perfectly length is long but i liked it i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge bootslove this top,1
13074,I am so happy i decided to purchase these they are the only invisible socks ive found that actually stay on my feet all others always slip off my heel these are great,1
13075,I loved this at first sight and ordered it in a and to make sure id get one that fit me i ended up with the i wear a dd bra so usually braless is not an option but this actually offers enough support and if i do want to wear a bra its got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it its super flattering and really fun to wear out day or night,1
13076,I ordered this in the chocolate color which is really a pinkishtaupebrown but i love the color its neutral yet not too pale just the right hue to go with almost any color and the style works with any outfit from jean shorts to a dress i love how soft the knit is although i worry it might be prone to snag especially the openweave sections i also love that the sleeves are full length fitted enough to be pushed up on my forearms yet i can pull them down past my wrists when i am chill,1
13077,I found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction,1
13078,Very pretty top the fabric is super soft i ended up sizing up from my regular xs to a s because the chest area was just a bit snug,1
13079,I just received the acacia swing tank and when i pulled it out i felt like it was christmas day all over it hangs nicely and felt luxurious on my skin even my husband was dazzled the detailing of the flowers is delicate and feminine the cutaway gives you a sexy casual chic appearance that you can dress up or down i cant wait to unveil this new piece at work,1
13080,I love the cut of this shirt interesting back and it hangs nicelysurprisingly flattering im usually a small and needed the xs in this shirt fyi very soft and overall just very pleased with this purchase i bought it in the denim as well,1
13081,So soft light and warm will work as an outer layer or fit under a coat the wine is beautiful with a subtle twotone contrast between the outside and slightly brighter inside even though its just one layer relaxed and casual yet will dress up a tee or blouseim usually m or even l but the m was too droopy at the shoulders so went for the s which looks less slouchy and more jackety on,1
13082,I was looking for cute comfy stylish tees and was ecstatic when i came across this one i purchased the coral and i love it its adorable on im going to purchase another color so happy,1
13083,I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun i really wanted to like it but i could not there were spots missing sequence some fell off as i tried the dress on and i did try it on twice each time there were some on the floor they are sewed on so poorly for the price of this dress i fear it would be a dress for one season and id have to throw it out not for that price so back it goes,0
13084,This tee is amazing its light weight and perfect for the summer heat the detail of the cross and tie back is perfect to elevate the style this is going to be a solid staple in my tee collection i wish it came in other colors because i would buy them all,1
13085,My new favorite socks has a grip and doesnt slip off like some of my other liner socks have because this one covers more of your feet perfect for my low boots,1
13086,Very pretty and a nice fit lighter weight than i expected at this price but as long as it holds up ill be happy,1
13087,Bought this for my daughter who is graduating this year looks much better in person then it does in the photo she is and lb we bought the size four great length on her green adds a nice pop of color she loves it,1
13088,Loved the look fit and styling of this turtleneck but dry clean only you have to be kidding,0
13089,This dress is so much prettier in person the pattern is unique adorable and not overpowering im an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats ft i think this is versatile enough to wear to work party or a casual wedding the fit is perfect hugs at the correct spots the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely overall i love it,1
13090,This skirt is much more vivid in person which i like the fit though was off for me i ordered my usual size medium i wear a or in bottoms the medium was fitted you could see every curve definitely not comfortable with that i would probably have a better fit with a size up however i am not a fan of the gray lining that you can see on the inner back portion of skirt so i think i will pass on this one,1
13091,This is beautiful dress with great fit i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel,1
13092,This blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully i dont think its too wide at all its soft and comfortable its stretchy yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape definitely a classic piece the sale price makes the cost more appropriate the white is a little transparent but with a tank its not a problem the black is beautiful im having a hard time choosing between them i love the cut and sleeve details it wouldnt have looked right with less fabric its needed for the sty,1
13093,This dress did not show well on the hanger but thankfully it intrigued me i love it its very flattering and easily dressed up for work with a heel or dressed down for the weekend great buy,1
13094,This is a great everyday top that is very versatile,1
13095,I love this sweater comfortable and flattering great for going out causal and staying warm,1
13096,Love the way this tee looks and feels so comfortable and fun good length perfect jeans tee,1
13097,The shirts fits well it is very soft and stretchy but thick enough that its not see through the collar is the best part i wear small and im,1
13098,I saw this peasant blouse online and thought it looked cute but not really enough to spend the money on i purchased a few other things instead i happened to go into the store to see a different top in person and spotted this one it is definitely cuter in person as with most tops like this it is baggy and loose however probably due to the elastic at the bottom this one doesnt look overly big and shapeless just a pretty top that will be perfect for spring for reference i am a,1
13099,The fabric quality and style are amazing the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult i generally dont wear shorts because of length style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler i usually wear a in pants i ordered the and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly one of my favorite purchases ever,1
13100,I wanted to love this shirt but was very disappointed i had read other reviews and still ordered but wish i would have listened the shirt looks nothing like photos online and is extremely boxy and unflattering had to send it back,0
13101,Really pretty color light breathable fabric and i love the high neck on this tunic i wear this tunic with black leggings a black tank and black sandals im not the smallest girl so i love that this tunic is a bit longer and has a bit of a belt wonderful pick up,1
13102,I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available when it did i was very excited in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me unfortunately neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts dont fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod,0
13103,I would highly recommend this top i usually wear a small petite but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly there is a lot of fabric but if you size down it wasnt an issue for me i weigh lbs and am feet tall also im busty d which worried me with this type of top not a problem i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this i am very picky and i was happy with the quality the fabric is not heavy its a fantastic purchase,1
13104,This is the cutest sweater i bought it today in black i cannot wait to wear it it is a lovely distinctive knit just the right weight to layer as shown with a white blouse or with a turtleneck i tried both the xs and s and i decided to go with the s as it still emphasized that i have waist but i could layer it nicely i am lb you can always count on angel of the north for great style,1
13105,Just received these pants today and i absolutely love them the material is super soft and the fit is true to size i ordered the tan color i really like the wide leg and the frayed bottom i may order the gray too,1
13106,Finally a dress that ticks all the right boxes mostly natural fibers lovely details fantastic pattern placement and an easy fit that doesnt require alterations the dark blue cotton is similar to my embroidered floreat sunless skies shift from around which looks like new after so many years but required alterations even in petite im currently dc bra the size regular fit me and ended just below my knees a bit low cut and a tiny bit below my nat,1
13107,This top is beautiful on it has very feminine detail and is very flattering the first time i wore it i got compliments on it i would definitely recommend,1
13108,This is a very comfortable bralette the silk covers ones most sensitive parts so it feels like you are wearing almost nothing its very pretty too i wear a b bra and the small fits me it doesnt have a lot of support but its very comfortable for wearing at home or on errands the cups are a little far apart but it still works if youre looking for something pretty and comfortable for casual wear i would recommend this at the sale price,1
13109,Great basic tee with just the right amount of extra detail the length is perfectnot too long not too short fit is relaxed and comfortable without looking sloppy im coming back for more colors,1
13110,I usually love maeve and generally feel like everything they make was made for me sadly this dress is a definite exception which could easily have been solved by changing the construction of the dress as other reviewers stated the dress does run small but even if you size up if you have any breasts at all the dress will pull at the buttons causing them to gape im only a b cup so not on the large side im pretty sure this is why the model has her arms crossed in the picture i love,0
13111,This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room so i tried it on on a whim and loved it so so soft too runs true to size i am and and got a small,1
13112,I ordered the black months ago it was on back order and i jsut received it finally the fabric is super soft itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one the v in front where it crosses is low so most people do need a cami underneath but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look not my style but could be done i plan on wearing this with skirts deresses and slacks i saw a commet on the lighter color not sure but love this one in black for sure,1
13113,Loved the red and white stripes and soft fabric lays nicely has a nice cut pairs well with jeans and a cute casual jacket or dress it up nice quality and color,1
13114,As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings these are probably the best ive ever found pure good makes top quality well fitting leggings that do not slide down shift around or become seethrough regardless of the physicality of your movement they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no illeffects they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i dont want nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep,1
13115,The photo of these is truly misleading they are a beautiful vibrant print see the closeup photo they are much longer on a regular person they come a few inches above my ankle and i am there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each like a pleat that really allows a nice flow these look great with boots flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large not lined but drape beautifully there are pockets sewn closed upon purchase and pack pockets,1
13116,So cute so comfortable so pretty so i guess i love everything about it it is not too short on me and i think you can wear it in many ways thought of adding a vest thought of boots cant wait to wear it i agree the material is substantial so it isnt flimsy for fall or winter happy with this purchase runs true to size i went with the op i sometimes chose regular length but this one is just right in the petite i have long arms but these sleeves are just right i am ft tall b,1
13117,This top is gorgeous the print is lovely and the material and cut are well constructed cant wait to wear,1
13118,This dress is really cute its not a complete bag on you i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is seethrough and that is the case but i own multiple pairs of skintoned underwear and did not find this to be a problem the fabric is lightweight but perfect for the summer it does wrinkle but a steamer is your best friend,1
13119,Quality is great fit is great and the message keeps me in a good mood and motivated throughout the day i got it in a size i am usually a sm in retailer tops and it fits great for reference lbs i usually dont wear grey but the bright colored font led me to make an exceptionvery happy with the purchase,1
13120,This is a beautiful dress its a great weight unique pattern and has gorgeous colors its fairly forgiving because of the heavy fabric but may run small on bottom i am a or in pants dress right now and i bought the i am and lbs and c also in the last stretch of a weight loss journey so if that helps anyone choose sizing also i have to buy long or tall pants and this dress was not too short and did not show my smooth wear underneath i love it and bought it at,1
13121,This is that one special whimsical beauty that you hope to open on christmas morning super comfy not at all itchy and the pattern and colors are super stunning even more vivid in person ive never seen anything quite like it very eye catching and oozing for compliments can be dressed up or down quite easily very warm and surprisingly true to size even with the ml combo id say definitely worth the priceit is expensive but this heirloom worthy piece is worth the splurge,1
13122,Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top very comfortable and stylish you can wear it either off the shoulder or not,1
13123,Great quality and cut they are so versatile which i love highly recommend these,1
13124,Light and delicate and certainly not a color i would usually pick for myself but at sale price this was a lucky steal for me if i had known how much i would love this dress i wouldve paid full price as for sizing i am top heavy but picked the smaller end of my size range instead of my usual the slip is just about tts and the silk outer is larger and flowy for fit reference dd barrel chested large upper arms and i purchased size,1
13125,I love this tee the material is thick but not too thick its highly flattering i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings the shimmer on the front adds something special,1
13126,The shirt was soft and very flattering on got multiple compliments,1
13127,Agree with other reviewers the jacket is better in person than on model very nice jacket model does it no justice,1
13128,I almost never buy anything full price here and usually wait patiently for a sale promotion however this really struck me and i decided to buy it telling myself its an investment piece for years to come its just so unique and beautiful the things that makes retailer unique that arent as common anymorepros very comfortable i was skeptical because its all polyester but its light and thin and breathable it feels wonderful on the skin the lining inside is ver,1
13129,From the photos i thought the design was embroidered in reality it is stamped on there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins but overall the design is just printed on the fabric i didnt feel it looked good in fact it looked kind of cheap to me so i returned it the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual i was disappointed it didnt work out,0
13130,I walked into retailer today to buy dishes for a registry later i walked out with this dress and another ugh it is so beautiful in person it eversoslightly flares out and it definitely has that s feel i got it in white and plan on wearing it for my rehearsal dinner with tan platforms and a flower crown for reference got some hips and thighslbs and i got a medium would have gotten the small but it was slightly shorter,1
13131,Got this in purple and love it ordered red and silver and only received red so far but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didnt fit well like the purple not sure what happens maybe miss sized,0
13132,Im so glad i found this gem in the store as the online pic does this shirt no justice the green version is vibrant and adorable and this shirt is lightweight without being seethrough for sizing reference im lbs c and a size petite i tried this in the store in a size and an only sizes they had and rushed home to order it online in a perfect fit so i believe its true to size the little detailsthe buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner,1
13133,This skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing ive ever ordered from retailer it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all there are also weird stitching lines one more thing that i didnt like about the skirt was that its a creamish color not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt its going back,0
13134,I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty its cotton,1
13135,Frumpy looked like a nightgown on me maybe better on someone younger,0
13136,Ugh i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews i tried small medium and large on and huge huge huge boxy fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention its way too boxy the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful i would try this one on before purchasing,0
13137,This top is dropdead adorable very well made and a flattering fit i noticed other reviewers saying it is wide and short but that was not my experience its a slight swing or trapeze shape but fitted through the shoulders so if you are smallshouldered and small in the chest this is a very very cute top for reference i am and a c and i took a size perfect when paired with dark skinnies or capris its also delightfully well made with excellent detailing the cute vi,1
13138,These pants were pretty different then my typical style but i love them they come down a bit longer then i think they are supposed to because i have shorter legs but i still think they are cute especially with a heel or clog good quality well made,1
13139,I bought this dress on a whim one day even though i wasnt sure where i would wear it but i just had to have it this dress fits beautifully and is very flattering i am and typically a size with large hips behind and a smaller waist the fit me very wellsnugged in all the right places and just right everywhere else i ended up wearing this to a benefit and i received many compliments go for it,1
13140,I initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater the fabric is very soft the only downside i see is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath though i think that will change over time as i wear it more it wasnt a huge inconvenience which is why i still give this stars i am always a small at retailer which is what i ordered so,1
13141,I really like this dress despite the somewhat gathered skirt it has a clean line and doesnt add a lot of volume around the hips the blue is a great color the length is well above the knee but im i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots,1
13142,I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy it matches a lot of things that i already own nice summer tee,1
13143,I am absolutely addicted to tunics so when i saw this on sale with an extra off i went for it im glad i did its absolutely beautiful i love the opposing stripe patterns the hilo feature very subtle and the tie back so cuteif youre petite like me though you may want to wear something underneathit does cut a bit low in the chest area,1
13144,Love the lace cut out detail on the sleeves which is initially what attracted me to this sweater just be careful with the threads the sleeves are long but are supposed to be as in the photo comfortable material with nice weave flattering cut i bought the ivory color in xs for my straight frame not too long,1
13145,I bought this sweater in the sky color just love it ill go back for the rust colored one,1
13146,If youre pregnant congratulations this shirt is for you if youve ever dreamed of being an xxs this shirt is also for you im a d normally a small or medium but often size down to xs in swing tops the xs is ginormous on me although it fits through the shoulders i can hold onto the bottom and stretch my arms straight out at the sides its that wide think flying squirrel what doesnt show in the pictures is that it also has a slight dolman sleeve which makes it look wide at the to,0
13147,Love it super cute super comfortable watch those bra straps,1
13148,Gorgeous cobalt blue color usually sm bought the small because of larger armholes so glad i snatched this one up on sale the detail on the top is amazing,1
13149,I ordered this top in white along with the meadow rue lace sleeve top while they are the same price they arent even close in quality this top is one of the sheerest tops that i have seen the trim pocket and the laceup tie are made from sheer type material that was twisted and didnt lay right and the tag sewn inside was sewn with red thread and showed through very visible i don t think it would hold up after many washes i returned this one and ordered another color in the lace sleev,0
13150,When these cords went on sale i bought a nd pair they are great work week pants i teach comfortable and machine washable the fit is relaxedtrouser,1
13151,I almost never buy full price but i did with this skirt it is adorable saw it in the store it is too short to wear to work but is fine for casual wear i am a size but the largest one they had was a and it fit perfectly id size down the fabric is stiff and the aline stands out colors are southwesternish can be worn with any color top i bought a cream colored top to wear with it that was on the sale rack but im sure there are plenty things in the closet that will go,1
13152,Im curvy and i often have trouble finding pants that dont have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs these fit awesome especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller they do emphasize my hips so if youre trying to hide hips these arent for you i love them thoughthey drape beautifully and feel great,1
13153,Unlike some of the other reviewers i found this dress to be true to size post pregnancy i am a on top and an on the bottom ordered a and it is perfect lbs and c perhaps thats because im long waisted and the waistline hits right below my rib cagethe colors materials and quality are wonderful i can see wearing this in the winter and summer in fact it will look lovely against sun kissed skinone thing the top portion appeared to be a knit in the pictures online howeve,1
13154,I saw this in my local store last night and was instantly drawn to the color it is more greenish than yellow i say this alot but this was so much prettier in person i would not look twice at it online the picture does it no justice i am not a pancho person but this looks very luxurious and expensive and it feels so soft and warm i tried the xss and it fit perfect i am typically a medium in other brands at antrho it is boxy but that is the point of a sweater of this type it will be p,1
13155,I loved the look of this blouse online i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good i am a p and b bra size this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back its as if the armholes were too far forward it is fairly short but i am short waisted i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e,0
13156,Great dress for a full figureforget about the horizontal stripes you can wear this with great style and get away with wearing those dreaded stripes the possibilities have been great because i wear this dress with sweater vests athletic vests sweaters jackets and wool scarves i have worn this dress with cowboy boots dress boots and pumps and it looks great with all options the material is thick enough that panty lines dont show women of different ages stop me and tell me they want thi,1
13157,This tank runs very true to size i ordered my usual size which fits like a glove couldnt go any smaller very pretty fabric which is lined above the peplum i personally like the higher peplum but its a personal choice great purchase,1
13158,Wonderful slimming leggings snappy and a great accessory for any professional outfit,1
13159,As always these pilcro pants did not disappoint i can always order a size and know they will fit like a custom pant i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model there is no crotch hang like in the photo i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming,1
13160,I love the navy blue color they are a fun alternative to skinny jeans the fit is great and they are super comfortable,1
13161,I ordered this on a whim during the discount upon sale price i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper its quite soft and is flattering i usually wear a medium got the ml and fits well,1
13162,I love the flowers on this top the style is cute with the band at the waist i ordered an extra small and it fits perfectly,1
13163,Purchased this top at my local store usually dont pay full price for clothing but had to have this top so cute and lightweight love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase i bought the floral design,1
13164,I thought this dress was beautiful but i felt it was a little young for me i am and was looking for something to wear to my nieces wedding if i had been the mother of the bride i would have kept it but,1
13165,This one pulled across my shoulders and neck in a creepy way did not like the way that it fit returned,0
13166,Its perfect perfect fit long enough to wear leggings and cover my behind its perfect,1
13167,Great dress fitted but flowing i like the colors and think it will easily grams iron to fall i am ft d waist,1
13168,These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans high enough that there is no muffin top but not so high they look like mom jeans typical ag super soft fabric they are like wearing sweat pants so worth the extra money for the ag jeans love the length too,1
13169,I love this i agree with previous post that say it is much better in person the fabric is high quality but not too thick i bought this to have something light to wear on a trip to italy and it will be perfect the color is so lovely and the flowy detail at the hem makes it unique its a basic without being basic im so glad i added it to my wardrobe,1
13170,Ive been looking for a midweight shrugon cardigan for a while now and ive finally found the one as a petite lbs lady with big boobs i hate clingy cardigans with buttons since they are just so unflattering luckily this cardigan is warm without being stifling fitted in the sleeve without being impossible to wear over clothes with differentlength sleeves and perfectly cut to slim even thought it is shrugy i especially like the back details which are even more curvefla,1
13171,I love this top the quality is excellent the blouse is lined and falls nicely i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans the color is described as orange but it really has more of a bronze tone looks very rich and exotic its perfect top when you want to wear jeans but want to dress it up a bit,1
13172,Runs small im usually a size sm for retailer clothing for reference im lbs b the tie around the waist of this dress is not a functional tie that you can relax a bit to give yourself more room around the waist i could not fasten the buttons to close the dress on the size the size fit enough to fasten the buttons but there was a lot of extra fabric and the arm holes were very large pretty vibrant colors but size up and be warned of the large armholes,0
13173,Great top im lbs and normally wear either an xs or s i ordered the white to start with and decided to go back for the other colors its a great basic to wear with pantsshortsskirts but the side slit and slant set it apart from a regular tank i opted for the small in this top just because of where the side slit hit,1
13174,My normal size m fit well but i wouldnt want it to shrink any hangs well,1
13175,Easy to take this dress from casual to dressy super comfortable and cute,1
13176,I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season i didnt realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return etc i love this so much,1
13177,This cardigan is not my usual color choice but the details were so beautiful i had to buy it when i saw it at the store the birds and flowers are detailed with sparkly little beads that are prettier in reality than you can see in these photos its also a versatile piece that can be worn in many ways and dressed up or down im only but i didnt need the petite which is good since it is sold out in petite the sleeves are cropped so they dont hang too low for me the sweater is hand wa,1
13178,Im an employee and bought this top today im so happy i ended up buying it on a whim its adorable and super comfy its perfect for those jeans and a tee day i cant wait to wear it to work the color is gorgeous and the peplum adds a feminine detail without being too puffyin love,1
13179,Love the dress but ended up returning it as im not sure how often i would wear it the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress,1
13180,The nolans are my favorite pair of jeans from any brand they are skinny leg but not too tight and the material is oh so soft i buy sizes down as they stretch out a lot,1
13181,I loved the look of this top online it had great lines i was so disappointed when i received it it has zero supportlining and im not large chested to need a lot its also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it making it even harder to get off it was returned,0
13182,I probably would not have purchased this sweater had i only seen it online because i typically think wool is scratchy but this sweater caught my eye in the store and it is as soft as a sweater can get i love the pink with the gold trim it is so soft and warm i have washed and worn it a few times already and have not had any problems with stretching either,1
13183,The photos on the website do not do the dress justice i am into texture pattern and contrasting fabrics this dress is gorgeous in person not only has pattern but the pattern is woven so there is this wonderful texture as well that i had to try some of the reviews said the dress runs large others that this is a bodycon dress i ordered a size and my usual both were figure hugging but the size allowed this to be office wear while still being flattering i am fairly straight small,1
13184,I bought this on a whim and i love it the colors are much brighter than the photo would indicate its definitely a poncho oversize is the name of the game but its cozy gorgeous and i wish i could wear it every day,1
13185,This dress is really lovely it looks so fragile online but in person is rather structured and substantial it runs very large i just returned mine for sizes down i also like the zipper up the back so that the eye hooks on the front are not necessary to use to put on the interior lining is affixed so there is no slipping like a typical under slip if you are on the fence at least try it i am glad i did,1
13186,The dress is pretty i ordered a and not knowing how it ran i took both back the neck is too tight,0
13187,This dress is beautiful in person i am and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect i only need inch heel and it will be fine details on the flowers are really nice one more plus it machine washable,1
13188,I loved this top it is exactly what i wanted,1
13189,I was already purchasing another mock neck in a similar color when i came upon this sweater it is everything a snuggly sweater should be it is long in the torso with long sleeves that really do cover your hands like in the picture online if you like that sort of thing this is a great sweater the sweater even has pockets which may be a little odd but on this sweater it works i bought this to wear with a pair of sanctuary flowered leggings it is the perfect outfit,1
13190,This is really a lovely top but the color online is not quite what the color actually is in person this was a find in my store today and it is a little more lilac than the picture shows the cut is extremely flattering and the fabric is very soft as is the case with most one september items the one recommendation that i have for this is that because the main fabric is a soft knit the proper undergarments are really needed i tried it with a lace bra and you could see a lot the details of the,1
13191,I was hesitant to order this top since i didnt know how well the design would be made on the front i liked it but sometimes items are different when you get them this shirt was as pictured the design is well made and there are no stray strings and i think its probably one of the nicer designs available the top iis a dressier fabric but can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants also some shirts with this cut are skimpy in the front and leave more skin exposed than what you see here t,1
13192,Love love love these pants i have yet to remove the tags and wear them but that shall happen over this weekend the fit is comfortable and while the pants are not oversized they are very generous in the mthat i purchased the colour that seems to confuse more than is few is really a great combination of a black or navy stripe depends on your lighting and opinion here with tobaccokhaki on a white ground the pleats at the topjust add to the great design and i like that they sit,1
13193,I love these jeans they have a great high waist thats tapered and supersexy long legs and some stretch but not to much the distressing is perfect and the wash nice and dark ill be wearing these alot,1
13194,I am ft tall and wear a size bottom i ordered these in a large because i wanted the length to be as long as possible and they were perfect i have a in inseam and these pants drug on the floor i could even wear my wedges with them and they were still beautifully long and drapey i bought the silver color and it was definitely more of a khaki i probably could have easily worn a medium as i did have to pull them up when i walked throughout the day this may be because of the stre,1
13195,Great pants im and about the size fit nice at the waist and loose in the thigh they hit right at the ankle the colors are nice muted the details are great overall great pants,1
13196,I love the way these shorts fit and look very comfy but after laundering one time the lavender color became blotchy used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas they are unwearable i have several colors but the only color that was a problem is the lavender for one wear was a waste i hate to leave negative feedback but be careful with laundering,0
13197,Beautiful and very versatile dress extremely forgiving for post baby bodies while stylish and classy,1
13198,With all the white dresses to choose from this year this was the one i settled on it is comfortable the quality is good especially in the edge detail its machine washable which is a must for me and white and it is easy to dress up or down i am lbs and found my usual size small to fit tts it is loose fit like the model shot easy throw on and go dress with cute details to boot,1
13199,Once i tried this dress on i understood why the pricepoint was so high its very thick but not uncomfortable and very well made love the color and style of this dress but as others have said the model picture is deceiving try it on in store to see if you like it for yourself im curvy on top and bottom with broad shoulders and personally it was a no for me i found other dresses that i loved more this one was pretty but wasnt a hit for me,1
13200,These jeans are amazing they are so comfortable they have a great amount of stretch but do not sag even after wearing them all day i am and lbs and purchased my usual size i did have to have them shortened but only bc i bought in store and did not have the petite online option i have worn them on several occasions great purchase,1
13201,This dress can be dressed up or down it looks cute w a black open sweater and looks great alone the fabric is very soft although it isnt fitted it doesnt have too much material either so it is very flattering on the back yoke also has the white embroidered flowers which finishes off a quality look the pockets are nice and light inside i usually wear a and the large fit perfectly i was also lucky to get it on sale,1
13202,I love love love this dress for everyday running around or you can dress it up with jewelry or a scarf so boho and so comfortable buying the other color now,1
13203,I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store the black was pretty basic looking but this color is gorgeous its quite flowy on me i wear an xss most places but usually small in tops here the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too one of my favorite tops at retailer right now,1
13204,This dress is absolutely flattering and will make you feel beautiful fabric is thin but can easily be transitioned from fall to winter to spring hugs all the right places true to size i am and lbs curvy and the small fit well i am so happy with this purchase great price point as well,1
13205,Lovely top that seems to flatter all body types fit is great fabric is soft style is lovelygreat to dress up or throw on with jeans,1
13206,Every now and then a piece like this one comes along at retailer and i quickly make the purchase without any regretwithout being stuffy or old this top is simply elegant the floral is very highend designer think italian made for a fraction of the cost made of bamboo it is light without being sheer there is no need for a cami with this one the fabric has the body of a good linen but it doesnt wrinkle nearly as much it does require dry cleaning though if this matters to you,1
13207,I thought the design of this dress was distinctive and it did not let me down there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on but i wouldnt sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony im and i got the petite which hit me about inches above my knee material is like jeans and consequently not seethrough at all even though it is quite expensive there is something special about the dress,1
13208,Love the tegan tunic version of this dress i assumed since it looked identical except for the length that the sizing was the same but i was wrong this runs so big i got a s in the tegan but the s in this dress looked like an oversized potato sack on i highly recommend ordering at least sizes down unless you want to look tenty,0
13209,This top is just a beautiful as in the picture it runs true to size and has a beautiful flattering shape on it looks great with jeans and sandals for a casual look but can easily be dresss up too im so sometimes i need petite sizing but i liked the length of the regular fit with this top first time i wore it i received tons of compliments,1
13210,I waited in anticipation for the turquoise version to appear online turquoise and red can be found on another product page with the same name size im between small and xs for most retailer brands i wanted this top to be a bit more fitted so i ordered an xs im tall lbs d with long torso and narrow shouldersfit xs is spot on for me i dont really mind the shorter length it didnt appear to be too boxy i layered a white shapewear tank underneath to help w,1
13211,I actually had no problem with the neck hole of this shirt even with the xs size however i had a huge issue with the bottom eyelet section its so tight it stretches across my thighs and looks so funny as the top part is still loose i tried moving up to a size small and still had this problem maybe just not for girls with thighs very strange fit,0
13212,This dress is just too baggy overall i am lbs and a size small was so unflattering i cant go down in size because the waist detail will get too high on me it was already a little high on the small,0
13213,These shorts were beautiful love the material and the way they fit the drawstring makes them very adjustable,1
13214,The dress is just perfect its fits true to size and the colors are as pictured also a bonus it travels well despite having so many pleats it folds nicely and can be worn right out of the bag very happy i got it while on sale,1
13215,I love layering this over basic tees or graphic ones like the wild west tee it adds just the right amount of edge currently building my pin collection to add on vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact,1
13216,Maybe its my curves or the way im only but this was a hot mess on me it is soooo long and cut to low for my d chest it is slim and the cut usually is flattering but somehow this dress was anything but it is really shiny and the material is heavier than anticipated for warm weather if you are super tall and skinny with no boobs go for it had to send back,0
13217,This shirt has absolutely no shape look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxyness of this shirt the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt i even ordered the xs at and lbs but found it too baggy returned,0
13218,First let me say that ive recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good midlength if you unroll them so i just went to try them on at the store and what do you know they are exactly that unrolled they come about,1
13219,This nightgown looked so comfy and cute i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tightim and lbs it was such a shame size large should not just be really a medium,0
13220,I am lbs d and the petite fit tts the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip my dress arrived with a nude slip i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing the lace actually stands out all in all a greal buy discounts make it worth it too,1
13221,This is a great top so beautiful with bright colors and sheen my only complaint was i am dd and it was tight so i had to size up otherwise my brests would spill up and out,1
13222,Such a cute pattern and i loved the foldover design but beware there is not enough bottom coverage i shouldve looked more closely at the photo its pretty accurate in showing the bathing suit bottoms have limited rear coverage a couple more inches of fabric wouldve really helped im used to fuller coverage bathing suit bottoms and these just expose way more cheek than i felt comfortable with i could maybe wear them around my husband but definitely not my dad i felt like if i bent,0
13223,I love this sweater i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure im curvy on bottom w a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i dont want to look like im wearing a moomoo this top looks chic its the right shape to flow gently its just the right detail to be different in an understated way i wear it w leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt neckline is good im a b and its flattering not sure if it will fla,1
13224,I have been eyeballing this shirt online during my visit yesterday an associate just happened to bring one out for me to try on as my store had just gotten it in happy coincidence the fabric is very soft and comfortable with some givestretch the sleeves seem sturdy like they will hold up in the wash i thought the shoulder area was fitted but not too snug however i have smallish shoulders the v neck wasnt too low no cami needed but low enough to be a little sexynot dowdy its fai,1
13225,This is my new favorite sweater and i want it in all sizes i have the ivory and now the taupetotally would have bought the green had it been in stock the red is a more rust color but it is still gorgeous although the knit looks and is looser it is still very warm i wore it today and was a little too hot for this mild day it is longer so it can be worn nicely with leggings and still look great but it has a good fit and shape so as not to look frumpy love tts but could also size down i,1
13226,I was really nervous when ordering this dress because of the other reviews but i couldnt get to a store during the mothers day event and really wanted this little number it arrived yesterday and im already so excited to wear it especially once i get just a tiny bit of a tan i love the fact that it is yellow and white stripes with the dragonflies on topthe pattern is so much cuter in person than it appears online the fabric is also a good weight and it is lined which greatly simplifie,1
13227,This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it,1
13228,I purchased these jeans in my regular size they are a slouchy slim leg that looks adorable with flats or heels i could have sized down but wanted the slouchy look they are very stretchy and soft have worn a few times and they retained thier shape,1
13229,Comfortable material fits true to size love the color and can wear all year round selected this dress for a fall wedding and its a keeper,1
13230,This dress is super flattering i love everything about it,1
13231,This is such a soft comfortable and well fitting blazer i love the structured cut of a material that is usually used in more casual designs i look forward to wearing it very often in the fall so glad i purchased this one,1
13232,I am loving these new leggings and i dont even surf i just wear them to the gym and at home and to run errands with a cute tunic top etc they make me feel sunny and happy fabric is light and flexible but stays in place went running in them size is accurate i am usually a on retailer pantsskirts on jeans and the small was perfect,1
13233,This dress hangs like a sack it really needs a belt to give it some shape i tried to style it with one but then didnt look right either i did like the slip that came with it ill be returning it,0
13234,I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me i drove to the store to purchase it however when i tried it on i was so disappointed the print is adorable and it is made of great quality but the swing style is definitely more than mini i could have fit of myself in this dress it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs also the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos and the floral print isnt as r,0
13235,Love shorts that i can dress down w a chambray top or that i dress up w heeled sandals and a blouse this is perfecti found them to run a tad bigi have thin legs but dont have a small waist at all i took a in them im usually more like a on bottom,1
13236,This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter its versatile i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs theres so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use just as an fyi the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them this may not even be noticeable if youre not looking right up close for me this adds to the unique quality,1
13237,Love this substantial pieced suede skirt by leifsdottir the photos i posted show the color in daylight on a cloudy day a bit more muted darker turquoise than the online pictures imagine a mini pencil skirt made of nonstretch polyester with a suede front panel over this is the longer open skirt which is attached at the sides to keep it from flying up when you walksizing based on the reviews i risked ordering this in a p im currently ish with narrow hips fuller behin,1
13238,Wonderful dress thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me normally this sort of dress wouldnt fit with it failing me in the bust but it fit quite well in most cases i would endup in a petite to accommodate my bust but with it then too large in the shoulders or the dress would have run so small i wouldnt have been able to button it in most places i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit but the quality as wellas described by other reviewers it,1
13239,This jacket has great style is really comfortable and looks good with jeans or nice pants i usually wear a small or extra small in all clothes but thought the arms were tight in the small the medium is a better fit,1
13240,I just purchased this blouse in store the fabric has a nice weight and drape feels nice to the touch and is opaque ill be wearing this one as a dress and a top im and this fell a couple inches above my knee i typically wear an xs at retailer and opted to go with a small for the extra length and because i hate when off the shoulder silhouettes pop up and become not so off the shoulder i laid the xs and small out to compare sizing and didnt notice a major difference width wise i typi,1
13241,Love bailey this dress does not disappoint the blue is beautiful and the fit is very flattering the material is really soft and the dress is very comfortable,1
13242,I purchased this top in blue and liked it so i ordered the red color i hated the way the second one fit im concerned the blue will not wear well after seeing the way the second one looked,0
13243,I ordered this top based on the photos this looked unique and beautiful plus ive loved past designs by this brand i thought this would be nice for summer there isnt a straighton view of the front of the top for a reason the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest away from the border of the rest of the flowers the flower looks kind of like a bee i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem,0
13244,Fabric is soft body runs a bit big but falls nicely length is great for leggings or skinny jeans overall wonderful tee shirt,1
13245,I love this top its perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer its material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer its a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then id size down one size from your normal i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly im tempted to buy this in more colors,1
13246,This dress was exactly what i was looking for a rich luxurious fabric a deep neckline and a tightly cinched waist i have a full bust and while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers for me it is a little miracle this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size thank you,1
13247,I ordered this online in a m and l because i am usually one of those on the bottom i will be returning both for a s the fabric is great and a cool pattern but it runs large by far in addition to the large sizing the fabric has a decent stretch so that makes it even larger i think the small will fit well and the cut is flattering i am about and it hits below my knees similar to the model in the picture so i would definitely get this in petite if youre on the shorter side its al,1
13248,I slightly balked at the cost but i am completely satisfied and glowing about the product and it is made in the usa in these times that means a lot supima cotton and the perfect design with reasonable deep vneck front and back and the slightly lengthened sides very ultimate design for a tee i bought the dark grey the tag says wash before wearing which is one extra step still i find this supima cotton tee pretty much divine i bought the dark grey in medium my usual size,1
13249,Good quality and design perfect for casual office definitely recommend i dont know why its called a cardigan because its more like a casual blazer note there is no button just the tie to close runs big im ordered the xs and its roomy,1
13250,So gorgeous the details make this tank so special the subtle sequin around the neckline are just enough to make this a dressup or dressdown top perfect with skinny jeans for an evening date night or a black cardigan for the office the fabric is soft almost like a very light weight knit sweater but so light that you can wear it for summer,1
13251,Wow great find and a true fit i totally dislike pant shopping and these are a gemslimming flattering and so comfortable the style is great great basic summer pant,1
13252,I have never written a review before and i love retailer and shop here often however i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money it is such poor quality it looks thick and flows in the photo it is very thin and it itches so bad i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail i will deff be taking it back and do not recommend it at all,0
13253,Looks lovely in the picture but looks poorly made in person runs very small i returned it,0
13254,Totally agree with the other reviewer just got this in the mail today and it is a beautiful dress but it does run one size too small i am always a size in maeve but couldnt zip this one up and at it is a tad short but im exchanging it for the in the hope that in the next size it will be a bit longerand that it will fit but it is a super flattering fit and the blue color pops a stunning dress and love that its machine washable,1
13255,I saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it but the price scared me away then while visiting in portland i saw it on sale at an retailer store when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said well thats a nobrainer i thought the same thing i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it its super fun and easy to wear i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties im lbs and the m,1
13256,This dress is beautiful and extremely well made if you can get into it the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back its form fitting so youd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper but its soooo form fitting im afraid i wouldnt wear it,0
13257,These leggings are so warm and comfortable theyre thick enough to wear as pants and they dont stretch and slide during the day i wish they came in more colors,1
13258,This dress is very comfortable not itchy at all and looks great runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but its still a worthwhile buy,1
13259,It was so cute in the pictures and i was looking for something to wear to my trip to europe so i purchased it but it really didnt live up to my expectations im and got a s it looked odd on mea little too short on the bottom a bit too big on top and overall i thought the material looked cheap for the price i returned it,0
13260,I bought a similar tee by velvet by graham and spencer a couple years ago and have been searching for another one ever since the wide straps are flattering on me because of my broad shoulders i love the price too very reasonable i want one in every color,1
13261,Its sheer the design print is casual but on silk like material had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer,0
13262,Beautiful and classy i love this im lbsb and my usual xs works great could probably also have worn a s i was a little worried itd be scratchy andor too structured but its soft and flattering photos are accurate would definitely recommend,1
13263,I was lucky to get these on sale with free shippingmy major lucky shopping moment of the year however they are worth every penny of the full price ive waited years before shelling out this much for a pair of nice jeans but now my skeptical opinion has done a turn these paige verdugo ultra skinny jeans are superior to any denim ive ever tried they look and feel fabulous on me i bought my usual size and am,1
13264,This seems like a simple tank but the shape of it is super flattering it kind of soles in at the seam and the shoulders are just adorable and sexy at the same time i love the detail in the straps coloring is neutral enough adn the fabric is very soft i am glad i finally tried it on jsut didnt want t pay full price but broke down as sizes are selling out smaller sizes i am usually xs petite and that is gone so is xxs so went with xs i am lbs and dd for reference,1
13265,This is a perfectly lovely jersey dress its really comfortable true to size and the cut is flattering you can wear it to work with heels or to the playground with your kids in sneakers or sandals i didnt want to take it off sizing is straightforward on this one just order your regular size theres nothing tricky about sizing the xxsp my regular size depicted here was just above the knee and not quite as long as the product description great buy waiting for boston weather to coope,1
13266,This shirt was on sale and it was a good price that is where the goods ended the shirt was not flattering i sent it back asap,0
13267,I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to readand now i know better the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos the sleeves however ran small compared to the body the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso the body the oppositetoo large and not flattering on an hourglass figureno darts no fitted places nothing making it tailored to fit open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette buttoned it sprea,0
13268,I originally bought this tunic in black and loved it so much i bought the rose as well normally tunics make me look like a box but the tie on this one makes it super flattering,1

13271,This picture does not represent these jeans the color is way off they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture they also run very small,0
13272,Great sweater with gorgeous detail fits tts works best in someone with smaller bust like me pink is peachy pink like other reviewers have commented pairing it with gray ag jeans will work great for fallwinter in louisiana,1
13273,I was checking out at my local retailer when one of the salespeople held up this top and said someone had just returned it they were talking about how cute it was they didnt have it in the store i asked what size it was and it was a medium so i said i want to try it on after trying it on i fell in love it is so cute the cut fit great it is a little big but the small might have been too snug in the bust if you are in between sizes you can probably size down i wore it yest,1

13277,The sweater material was fragile there were already two picks in the fabric when it arrived i felt like it would not wear or wash well i was also disappointed in the shaping or how it hung on my body i am returning the sweater,0
13278,I love this tee but it isnt for everyone i am usually a solid medium i tried on both xss i went w the small bc i liked the volume for reference im and wear a mediumsize not thinking this is for small petite women as the peplum hem is poplin not tee knit material so it holds its shape on my frame it was so cute got the holly color,1
13279,I love how elevenses fit and the length is awesome when i wear flats this is one of the few brands that sometimes carries a longer inseam this style is a bit shorter however with the lighter fabric i wouldnt want it touching the ground pants are breezy and i love that they are lined to the calf call me old fashioned but all pants should be lined the elastic waist is nice and flat in the front and works wonderfully since my butt is larger than my waist,1
13280,I saw army green pants similar to this in the store but then found these on line and ordered them instead i love them they stretch out a bit so i am glad i sized down i could possibly have sized down even one more size i got a the waist is very comfortable so maybe this is just the fitafter all they are basically stylish fatiques either way they are casual but on trend i have planned a ton of outfits in my head already because these pants will go with so much i think the cuff w,1

13291,Material is so thin this shirt ripped in three places after wearing only oncegot a size larger than i needed as i have a larger chest and even though its a bit lose the thread has ripped material on my chest and in the armpits,0

13296,Absolutely beautiful i am extremely happy with this purchase i bought this top a couple of months ago and have worn it many times initially i was a little apprehensive to order due to some of the other reviews but i found that this top is very figure flattering it is very soft and warm and i am positive it will be in my wardrobe for quite a few years to come i am almost sad that i will have to put it away for the season soon,1
13297,My only complaint is that there is no lining it also came very wrinkly and i need to figure out how to steam ithowever the fit is perfect tts and it is so very flattering,1
13298,I took a chance on this in green extra small one size smaller than my normal size because that was all that was left and i thought i could wear it under another sweater no its too awesome to waste as a liner its the most amazing cut and fabric it so flattering and so softplease bring back this top,1
13299,I gained a million pounds in the last couple years so now i usually stay away from anything clingy or stretchy but this dress is genius it somehow looks smooth over everything while clinging to the curves in all the right places and none of the wrong ones im about pounds and have a proportionate hourglass shape the m actually fit great normally id wear a large but the stretch and flattering cut of the dress made the m look better i would venture to guess most people could size,1
13300,I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print and i think its cuter in person than it is online the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special i am normally a size and the small fits me perfectly also i appreciate that its lined i wore it with skinnies and received lots of compliments its the perfect tank for summer,1
13301,I had such high hopes but they are just slightly off they run a tad large so i suggest sizing down i usually wear a or and the fit nicely through the hips and thighsunfortunately the color is off i thought they were going to be a dark midnight blue but they are actually gray and they have a buttonfly closure which causes the pants to protrude a bit in the area where no woman wants protrusion i will be returning them,0
13302,Just received this top in the mail purchased at the sale price beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down excellent quality fits tts for reference im lbs ordered the sp xs i kept the xs the sp had an elastic waist there was no drawstring not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received,1

13304,I love this top so cute and comfy but i wore it twice washed it once on gentle and layed to drynow there are small holes in the front for as much as it cost i would have expected it to be more durable very disappointing especially since i dont live near an retailer and cant take it back easily,0
13305,Im super into this top i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner on the other hand this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans,1
13306,The blue is not see though at all and the length is perfect so many tops now are on the longer side or have the highlow hems this one is greatlove it kinda want the white one now,1
13307,I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant the design is unique and provides visual appeal and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place i love the high waist on these,1
13308,I saw this in the sales section today and was drawn to it by the color and style i really didnt think itd fit on me even though the only size available was a size because it looked like a sheathtype dress thats more body hugging and usually such dresses just dont work well on my wider hips and hourglass frame howeverl heres what i thoughtpros beautiful blush pink it looks exactly the same in person as online very comfortable as the other reviewer mentioned t,1
13309,These were not tts imo i am a and ordered the m they did not look bad but bc these have no stretch they were not comfy like joggers are supposed to be i ordered the lg when they went on sale and while they are baggy the comfort is spot on in the larger size i got the navy after seeing the irl pics happy with this sale purchase,1

13311,Although this isnt a soft top i didnt find it that scratchy or bothersome at all its linen and for linen its soft its also got tons of stretch which makes it very comfortable as far as movement i bought the black and i do not find this sheer or seethru its a light thickness which makes it perfect for layering under a jacket or sweater for a cool spring or warm fall day i found it running tts with the sleeves and length a little long im petite making perfect for the av,1

13314,Let me start off by saying that i really really wanted this jumpsuit to work as it looked good on me and was tts got a p unfortunately it didnt work out due to the two buttons at the top which break way too easily i had to return it and exchange for another jumpsuit but it did me no good as the second one did the very same thing so i didnt even bother trying it on the buttons broke through before i even got the chance as the material is far too thin and the back of the buttons just pop,0
13315,Great dress fit perfectly warm for the winter i live in florida it will be great if we get a winter next year very comfortable and easy to wear,1
13316,I wore these pants to work and they fit and looked great however the first time i put them through the wash they became all discolored and are completely stained and now are unwearable very disappointing did not spend that much money to wear a pair of pants once,0
13317,The colors on this blouse are beautiful and even more vibrant in person i love that the blouse is lightweight perfect to wear to any holiday gathering,1
13318,Pretty top love the color and the large ruffle makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace,1
13319,I love relaxedfit wide leg pants with some pockets and draw string so naturally i was super excited to see these i got them in gray and they felt and looked perfect right out of the bag material was soft and flowy but not too thin unfortunately the sizing is completely off unless i got a defective pair i got my usual size l and they felt like s or smaller i barely could get them on and i could not zip up id need at least two sizes larger for them to fit at all very disappointed will l,0

13322,My friend and i bought the same dress we love it so much we get so many compliments great purchase,1
13323,I love clothes and my mom raised me to look for styles that are different and unique these pants are it they fit beautifully but run slightly big im between a and a actually kept both the fits great in the hips and legs plenty of room if you have curves i do not but its a tad tight in the waist if that helps these are a perfect length at they hit above my ankle bone and look perfect w a pointed closed shoe i love the colors and am bored to death of black and grey,1
13324,After reading the reviews i was hoping to be able to try this on in store i was able to try on a xxs and a xs in the store on the sale rack i tried both on and i usually will take an xs or small in sweaters funny but the xxs seemed to be a little longer in the front and the fit is nicer on me after reading others review of this sweater i thought for sure it would be super short on the xxs but it wasnt just goes to show you should always try on first i did not feel that the sleeves were l,1
13325,I have been shopping at retailer for years and this is my first review that is how much i love this dressit is so incredibly comfortable it is like wearing a cozy blanket you guys it twirls i never received as many compliments on an outfit as i do when i wear this dress i bought the orange one i am plus size and i dont wear a whole lot of knee length dresses dresses in general are hard to find because they dont fit right so i was thrilled to find this i am also thrilled that it,1
13326,Picked this up at the store in my usual size small it fit perfectly i am a d and the buttons closed with no gap the length was just above the ankle and the fit is slim so comfy my guess is this is going to sell out because everyone including the sas wanted to buy one loved the color toovery versatile,1

13329,Very pretty top comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work,1
13330,I love the pattern and flowy design i also like the peach liner but i will use that on other outfits i own and replace it with a slip that has a designed hem this top is too long for me to wear as a top so i will wear as a dress with the a longer slip im hoping that the sequins will remain intact for the most part as the construction of everything is too delicate bought the size s and i am,1
13331,I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo i wore it one time and received so many compliments when i washed it however it shrunk almost size the pant legs were high water i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldnt budge i think because rayon is not stretchable material to my disappointment i returned it i really wished it would have worked out,0
13332,This skirt is so gorgeous the picture doesnt do it justice several layers of mesh i am and this skirt is very long which i love so glad i found this in my size for such a great price highly recommended,1

13334,Bought these in store and bought another on line super comfortable and great for a casual look great length as well love the pilcro line,1
13335,Just too much cuteness the print is amazing the bow is darling and the crisp structure keeps it from being too precious looks amazing on my hourglass shape runs a bit smallhad to size up a bit and felt more comfortable once i put a piece of fashion tape in a spot that gapped a little definitely worth the splurge,1
13336,Its stunning in person delicate beading detail on bodice isnt visible in the photo but really dresses it up fits lovely but runs small i am usually a or ordered the and it just fits fully lined bought it to attend a wedding and im very pleased with it,1
13337,Really cute fun print nice summer dress,1
13338,I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first thank goodness for thatat first glance i knew i wouldnt be buying this the construction leaves much to be desired from the flimsy single layer of unlined unstructured fabric to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim,0
13339,I love this shirt it hides my tummy perfectly without being too baggy super cute,1
13340,Saw this on line and decided to splurge for the holidays arrived today and is going right back runs very small especially in the waist trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture appears cheap and very itchy sooooo disappointed,0
13341,This top has beautiful subtle metallic bits in the pattern fell in love with the fabric looks great with highwaist pants,1
13342,This looks awesome with leggings jeggings and booties or slip ons great buy its a wee big but there are slits up the sides pretty high,1
