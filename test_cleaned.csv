0,Have to disagree with previous posters i found just one of these on the sale rack in my local retailer someone returned it from online and it was adorable on got many compliments in the dressing room area other customers asked if there were more available but its turns out its an online exclusive it does have a zipper i recommend sizing up not because it runs small i think its pretty true to size but i think it looks better a bit loosedrapery fabric is soft and pretty tailoring is f,1
1,I love everything about this top first its super flattering especially if you have a tummy i am small chested and it makes me look a little chestier than i am i tried on both the xs and s in the black its really a charcoal gray but preferred the fit of the xs note im lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big my store didnt have the wine color or i would have purchased it too,1
2,This dress has a marilyn feel to it felt like a dream,1
3,These cords are great the fit the style everything my new favorite fall pants,1
4,This top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace it would be a great top to use as loungewear though,0
5,It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso but it works great with a tank underneath love it,1
6,These jeans are one of my all time favorite ag jeans comfortable denim dark rinse wide cuffs are fashionable but still classy wear them all the time,1
7,This is a great jacket for fall layering love the color and cut it wasnt appearing to me in the photo that the sleeves were knit but it actually works i wear the sleeves pushed up as i have really long arms and they are a smidge short now my go too for casual work days and weekend wear,1
8,I just received this in the mail today and havent taken it off since i feel like i should be in a romantic movie with a cute black dress under it can definitely see myself getting a lot of use out of it can not wait to wear it for the holidays,1
9,This piece is gorgeous in person it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything it is more of a coat than a sweater i bought one for my mom and picked one up for myself when it went on sale it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection,1
10,Im not sure why this dress is getting great reviews the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh it was one of the worst fittingcut dresses ive every tried on at retailer im maybe you have to be feet tall and pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume,0
11,Love this top bought it in both color ways just adorable and washes well great option for larger ladies retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me and there is nothing for us it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you but you dont want it,1
12,I happened upon a pair of these shorts that someone had returned they are the perfect length they are very well made i have worn them to my sons baseball game and the sec tournament they are tailored and have an interesting design they make me look as though i have lost ten pounds i am thrilled with them,1
13,Oh how i love this dress i was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the fabric it is a wonderful feel of cotton and not that poly that sticks to your fingers it fits like a dreamtrue to sizeromantic and flirtyi can see this with cowboy boots and hat as well as with evening sandalsthe possibilities are limitless i am so happy i was finally able to snag one up as a return because it sold out just love it i also plan to wear it in the fall with a jean jacket it is a winter whit,1
14,I have this dress in white and i have worn it twice for completely different events i wore it with red heels for a dressy look and then with boots and a jean jacket for a more casual look i am only and it hit above my knees its a soft white that is appropriate for winter wear love it,1
15,I love the design of this top the pattern is beautiful and the back unique i am a mom of two so i really appreciate the extra front coverage i can run around at the beach with my kids and not be worried about overexposure i am a d on top and purchased the large and it fits well,1
16,Cute comfortable top fits well and will look great with skinny jeans,1
17,I bought this top on the advice of another tall reviewer and im so happy that i did this is the perfect top for tall girls i did size down from my usual large to a medium the top was still oversized but in a very pretty way i love the material this top is so soft and extremely comfortable the v neckline is very pretty and not too low i can see myself dressing this up with nicer pants for work or with skinny jeans for a more casual look if you are a tall girl this top is a must h,1
18,I was expecting a lot more but this was disappointing the material is thin and the quality isnt great it also hung loose just too loose as it runs very very large i returned it,0
19,The straps are long but work ok for me the material is very soft and the color pink is very nice this is a tank you can wear under almost anything as the soft silky fabric will allow whatever you wear to glide right over itno sticking,1
20,So much cuter than the picture i bought a m and im a c i thought it was comfy n flattering,1
21,A beautiful sweater and very flattering on the stock photos do not do it justice but i had to give it only stars because it was so itchy that i couldnt even keep it on in the dressing room for more than a minute,0
22,This shirt is so beautiful and fits perfectly it is so soft too i didnt expect it to be so soft,1
23,This dress is even prettier in person im and usually a in fit and flare dresses and got this in a fits like a glove and hits right above my knee the hook and eye closure does get caught on the delicate lace so be careful of that otherwise this dress is perfect for summer weddings,1
24,Very cute in person too soft to the touch and comfy as a person on the shorter side the roll up cuffs sold me on these pants cant wait for it to get cool enough to wear them,1
25,The fun coloring of this tee gives what would otherwise be a basic tee its flare it is a very soft shirt and will be cute with anything the length is good too you can tuck in or leave out i believe it is tts it might be a little sheer in some lights but i think you could pull it off with a nudecolored bra its not sheer enough to me to warrant an undershirt,1
26,I ordered this in size xl and it is a perfect top the draping is very flattering to my shape the material is soft and the flowerscolors are appropriate for work its the perfect length too i love everything about the cut of this top the pattern will vary on each since the flowers are staggered i love the knot effect along the waist great purchase hope this style will continue to be used for other tops in other patternscolors for springsummer timeframe these are a little too darkheav,1
27,I love these jeans i am usually a size or in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size i chose the baggier fit the size did fit but it was a more fitted look so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing but the availability of these makes it almost impossible i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha,1
28,This dress is very beautiful the dark color makes it very elegant i tried on different top white silver light blue etc they all look very nice with the dress you can wear it casually or formallydepending on what kind of top you wear,1
29,Im and ordered the small as soon as i saw it in person i knew it was an item to return the material is too transparent and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see it was way too long for me i think it would work for a taller person i just didnt feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency,0
30,Bought this blouse in white fits great can be worn with many things dressed up or down,1
31,This is a beautiful dress and my husband agrees im lb and the xs was long on me and a bit baggy on top i looked in to having it taken up but i think that will be hard to do without damaging much of whats elegant about the dress i hope that someone with more curves and a bit more height is able to enjoy this one,1
32,While i do love this sweater it did not fit me as is pictured the wrap does not lay as smooth and i had to adjust frequently when transitioning from a sitting to standing position nice weight,1
33,Im not sure if the top i received was damaged or if the design didnt consider gravity but this is not what i expected i really want to like this top but i dont see how i can wear it,0
34,I love this top the length is just right and i love the flow of it,1
35,Love this dress and have bought the style in three colorpattern variations fits comfortably looks polished yet effortless appreciate that the sleeves come closer to the elbow gives it a vintage vibe,1
36,Tracy reese always pleases this coat is absolutely awesome it is gorgeous the faux fur is soft and cozy this coat is warm i love the snap closure this is the sort of attire that makes you feel lovely and is cheerful for those dull winter days so happy to have in my wardrobe a collectors item for sure,1
37,White lace peplumall my jams so this top was a no brainer order what i didnt realize was how cozy the cotton would be it was like just wearing a cozy tee but looked so much better i am lbs c and the small fit perfectly,1
38,The fit of this sweater did not flatter my bodytype the top half did not fit well the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward,0
39,I was looking for a pair of ankle jeans to wear with booties i love my regular length paige hoxton jeans but they are too long me if i want to wear booties i decided to try the petite size and perfecto just the right length and the rest of the fit was just like my other paige jeans i love when you can count on sizing to stay true across styles,1
40,I was so surprised by this jacket i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love i have a pink dress im going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t i am so excited for cooler weather be warned its not lined or warm its more of a shirt than a true jacket but its perfect for fall in california i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one,1
41,I was so smitten by this shirt when i saw it online i love embroidery and purple is my favorite color i am a size and decided to order an l the shoulders fit well but the rest of it was hugelike another reviewer saidlike a maternity top i would also concur with the reviewer who said what takes away from the lovely purple flowers is the blotchy moss dye finish on the fabric this is so true the embroidery does not stand out is not highlighted like in the photograph they hav,0
42,Just got the silver ones in the mail yesterday really great fall pants they are quite a bit more grey than how they look on my computer so i was a bit surprised but not unpleasantly im one of those people who always has trouble with pants because my thighs are bigger and my waist smaller than usual im with a inch waist and inch hips i ordered the so my legs could fit inside the pants but there is quite a bit of gaping at the waist meaning that i cannot go without,1
43,I love this jumpsuit i ordered it unsure but i am so glad i did it is super comfy and fit perfectly i loved the lengthcan dress up or down it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked trim my mom friends and complete strangers complimented me when i wore thisand thats when you know you scored,1
44,This dress is very lightweight and great for fallspring weddings i received several compliments all night sits very nice on the waist as well,1
45,I am pleased with this skirt the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips i ordered a which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse i am and it works well for work and leisure,1
46,First off the moment i put on i got tons of compliments from complete strangers it truly is a unique and pretty i am and originally wanted the med petite for length they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size that worked out good it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size overall xs was a good alternative to medium petite,1
47,The material is soft maybe not the best quality and the cut is easy to wear i have both colors and love themthey wash nicely and i like the baseball cut at the bottom i especially like the print at the neck linevery cute and feminine,1
48,Fell in love with this romper online but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large i wanted to try it on in the store this romper is even better in person extremely flattering delicate details and lined its adorable i am glad i tried it on in the store i am usually a size medium but the small worked better for me i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer,1
49,I just received this dress and it so adorable with the pineapple print really flattering on and very well made the shoulder styling and cut out in the back makes it really stand out for style the con for this cute styling is it is not bra friendly no matter what bra you wear even strapless will show in the back cut out as it is open where most bras go it has handy side pockets and fits very true to size im a in most dresses and the fit perfectly everywhere but i am sending it back,1
50,Never thought i would buy a jumpsuit but this one is gorgeous i put true to size i ordered a m and a l i kept the l because i like the looser fit weigh and am tall i carry any extra weight at my waist and the l just looked better i almost always wear a m in retailer clothes love the feel of it and the way it looks on me really looking forward to wearing it on sale it is a great buy,1
51,I have a hard time with jackets fitting because i have chubby arms compared to the rest of me i like the way this fits and it doesnt pull when i try to cross my arms in front i feel like its good quality and hopefully wont flake the way vegan ie fake leather can and i think i can throw it over a top with jeans or a dress and it will be cute and versatile i also like the length that hits right at my hip im and dont like when jackets like this are are too long,1
52,I was hesitant to get this piece but for the price i couldnt resist and im so glad i got it it is beautiful in person and can be worn so many different ways it really makes you look slim too i got the size small and i am and lbs and its a perfect fit,1
53,This jacket is well made and the fit is perfect it is quilted and will work well three seasons of the year it goes with jeans cords and flannel and would work with skirts and dresses colors are a bit more muted and darker than my display shows but only slightly studs and black trim really punch up the look of this jacket i am very pleased with it,1
54,I love these tanks the straps are wide enough to hide my bra straps theyre soft and long enough to give me added length to shirts that run short because this tank runs small and i had to size up to get the fit that i like the straps are a little long but after i alter them with a little sewing theyre perfect ive had to do this with retailer tanks in the past and its worth it to me for the quality that im getting the regular price is too high so i only buy them on sale i try,1
55,I am all about beach cover ups i already have the leblon one from this season which i loooooove but i love this one tooand it is in my goto color which is fantastic i love beach cover ups i always imagine the sounds of the birds waves rolling in and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach my reality of course is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond not rolling waves but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo,1
56,Ok stop everything take out your credit card order this blazer immediately im obsessed with blazers but was on the fence about ordering this one i mean how many black blazers can one girl own but after reading the outstanding reviews i decided to go for it im so glad i did the online pictures do it no justice whatsoever i was afraid the polyester blend gold buttons would look cheap but boy was i in for a surprise when i opened my package the black fabric looks highend,1
57,I love this tunic perfect for the beach or by the pool gorgeous design and even better in person light weight i am usually a smallmedium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit,1
58,I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker its really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress you cant wear a bra with it because it is backless so i dont understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house,0
59,I was worried at first that the metal leaves would come off easily i was pleasantly surprised after a day at disneyland i dont think i lost even one of them this dress is super fancy but very comfy,1
60,These are the best leggings ive ever worn because they are structured and substantial they are less casual than ordinary leggings i bought them for a trip to paris and i wore them many times theyre sleek stylish comfortable and they go with everything,1
61,As soon as i opened the package i knew that this is going to be my all time retailer favorite many reviewers mentioned how puffy the sleeves are but i see it as quite proportioned with the rest of the dress tts i am and lb ps fits perfect i am an addict of retailer dress,1
62,I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt not at all im either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight it is more fitted if you are looking for something more comfy dont buy however if you want more of a fitted blouse feel then go for it,0
63,Nice skirt texture pattern gives it character does run a bit large,1
64,This dress is gorgeous i ordered it because i was getting other things and there was free shipping i am and abt lbs usually between an xs and s and also between reg petite sometimes i have to order multiple sizes to get a decent fit i ordered a sz small petite and its perfect super soft great colors perfect length love it,1
65,The orange version is very nice bright but not tacky the fit is super flattering and i love the crisscrossed hem the top part is also flattering on the shoulders halter but need a strapless bra the fit me well no need for petite on that one might be too short for medd in waist lbspattern is also gorgeous recommend,1
66,Really really like this dress expected it to be shorter based on other reviews but at it it was a great length for me it is true to size and while it was a little bit of a loose fit it was just enough to hide trouble areas sometimes i struggle with dresses such as this because they are too big on top and snug in the hip area but this one was perfect for me great find,1
67,This vest is perfect it is a great layering piece to be worn with jeans slacks or a skirt it has a substantial weight without being restrictive i made the purchase based on the other positive reviews and it was love at first sight,1
68,I tried this one on in the store and my typical xs fit perfect its not too boxy in the waist like every other sweater this season also the mock neck is not to wide and is flattering it sheds which i do not like but not as bad as some the material is thin but warm i would layer it,1
69,Nice fabric great color would be lovely on someone with a straightandnarrow body type for ladies with curves take a passtoo much like maternity wear and not in that elegantly slouchy kind of way the straightup is she or isnt she kind of way,0
70,This dress is a zillion times cuter in real life its very retroswingy and girlish it reminds me of something mia farrow wouldve worn in her rosemarys baby era i have the black version and ive paired mine with tall black gladiator sandals for a more sultry nighttime look and also flip flops for beachy summer days i think its a total steal at the sale price,1
71,Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy it must be pinned in the picture online its very frustrating when they do that thank goodness i didnt pay for shipping for reference im and pounds and bought the xxs its going back for sure im trying to lose baby weight not trying to look pregnant,0
72,This is a cute top but it runs pretty big order a size down the material is like a thick gauze almost so id definitely wear a tank under,0
73,I got this i n regular xs i am xsp or xxsp so it fit fine considering is boxy it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual it gives a nice dressup kick to any jeans shorts capris im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody just be careful since is delicate,1
74,This is a nice shirt but i cant keep it i ordered a and i do have an athletic build with somewhat wider shoulders given how petite i am usually wear petite in all pants and i think this size was perfect fit across the back perfectly when you lift your arms the way it is cut makes it really tight across the chest and shows your stomach at the same time the high low styling makes for a really strange shirttail in the back im sure this is the trend but it really does not look cute,0
75,Ive never bought a tee at full price in so many colors i love this teeits quite possibly the most perfect fit ever the material is thick and hangs well without being stiff or bulky im lbs usually a small petite or p but purchased the regular small so i can wear this with skinny or regular jeans i purchased the purple navy and black and may go back for the yellow the white is still a little too sheer fir me otherwise i would have purchased it wish they had a light grey versio,1
76,I love this turtleneck its soft cashmere blend is sexy with the lace design and loose but form fitting style and the s inspired sleeves are really flirty i purchased it in two colors because i got so many compliments the first time around,1
77,This dress is adorable i purchased it in black and white to wear to my daughter s bridal shower i received so many compliments it was comfortable stylish and best of all wrinkle free i actually ordered it online and when i got it the dress required no ironing of any kind love it i think i may have to get in in the red also,1
78,Bummer i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen seriously looks maternity to me the neck is also too wide the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didnt work on me i returned this one,0
79,I just purchased these jeans online in my regular petite size lbs as thats the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the s to feel much more comfortable so id suggest sizing up one size the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the s i just personally prefer the fit of the s better these jeans give a nice shape in the back are super soft and are the same color,1
80,Thought this would be a great dress for warm days but alas it fit like a sack love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses shame this did nothing for my curves ordered an usually wear a and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders if you can sport a loose swingy shape this is a great dress with nice detailing but sadly the shape did not work for me,0
81,i like a shorter jacket but this one was poorly made and poorly fit the sleeves were way too tight im a size or and the large which would be a had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out i ordered both a medium size and a large size and neither hung right the m too tight and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves very polyester with lots of static cute idea but not very good in pe,0
82,I normally dont write reviews for clothing but this dress warrants an exceptioni am a little over six months pregnant and have a shotgun wedding at city hall in a couple of weeks with a limited amount of time to plan i bought a bunch of pregnant wedding dresses online and rented the runway to arrive just before the actual ceremony out of curiosity i walked into retailer today to see if they had any white or ivory dresses that would look cute and city hall weddingish they did so i too,1
83,This one is way better in person admittedly i put it in my basket only becasue it was on the stylists pickswell it is great a little sheer adn super staticy when i received it but oh so soft the plunge is a tiny bit low for my liking but this doentt come in petitesso i had to suck it up and keep the regular sie teh coloring is nice too neutral event htough there is rust and navy and greayish it stil lcan be worn with anything,1
84,Great quality and extremely flattering bonus that it is on sale i felt like this dress was a godsend i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy i think ill get a lot of mileage out of it as theres enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then hopefully i can wear it after too also can be dressed up or down so appropriate for many occasions i believe it runs true to size i sized up from xs to s for obvious reasons but,1
85,Cant say about fit just yet since it is a gift color is soft green and versatile finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt,1
86,This bodysuit will be a staple for me this winter i wear it own its own and under just about everything i just ordered another one,1
87,Very comfortable well made great with leggings or skinny jeans,1
88,This top was a great find it has a beautiful print on the front and goes perfect with my olive green shorts capris and pants it is slightly sheer but not so much as to need a cami underneath fits true to size i love it,1
89,I bought this shirt in the tealnavy and loved it so much that i went back and bought the whitenavy too it is so soft the shirt runs a little tight but is stretchy and not uncomfortable the sleeve length and neckline dress up this shirt a little bit from being a standard t shirt yet it is just as comfortable overall very cute and flattering,1
90,I bought the gray and white to take on a trip i wore it nearly every other day looks good layered with a cami or short sleeved tshirt also threw on a blazer one chilly night and it looked nice enough to have a dinner outcame home and bought it in red and white and solid white true to size not clingy not baggy and comes down just long enough to cover the tummy,1
91,This skirt is a beautiful fabric heavy and soft and fully lined it has two sets of snaps on the inside so you can adjust the waist size i purchased a medium but found that there wasnt enough of an overlap in the split to be decent it flaps open when i walk revealing nearly everything so i will be exchanging for a large for reference i typically wear a size or in pants and skirts the color is true to the photos with a matte finish i am and length hit me below the knee,1
92,Love this sweater and it is so soft and cozy cause it has a little wool in itnot scratchy at all usually wear size i got a small regular not petite looks great with leggings and skirts not to long for a shorty like me,1
93,I purchased this instore in a vivid red color but didnt try it on until i got home big mistake literally the first time i tried to zip the dress the cheap horrible zipper noted in previous reviews justbroke midway up right under the waist tie i was trapped in the dress for a good minutes and was scared id have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape cant wait to return this asap,0
94,I saw this trench in an email a couple weeks back and instantly fell in love i bought it for myself for my birthday and got it just the other day and it is just as beautiful in person as it is online fits true to size and is so flattering i love the true navy color and cannot wait to wear this on cool spring nights,1
95,It is a little pricey for what it is but i love it so much that i am keeping it i am normally size and the s fits great the rope straps are just adorable,1
96,I purchased this lovely blouse to go with slim cropped stretchy pants good for bum coverage while still looking sleek and tailored i purchased the medium instead of small as this is a true fitted button up style and i wanted to avoid the gaping at bust the arm holes are fitted nicely as well no bra exposure looks very nice on on point for sure for reference im dd ruler shaped figurenarrow shoulders and usually a small or medium at retailer,1
97,Great dress true to sizewore it to dinner one night while in a beach vacation friends got tons of compliments you have to be careful when putting it on as it may snag otherwise highly recommended,1
98,I ordered this top on line i wanted to love it but unfortunately the fit was not for me i am with a long torso this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top,0
99,I was so excited to get this dress and it was such a disappointment it looks so cute on the model but it was very different when i got it the color is a lot more yellow than i thought it would be and the pattern just looked a bit strangeit stood out more against the yellow instead of looking neutral the dress fit really awkwardly on the top the straps were way too long and the chest area was practically baggy when i put it on i normally wear a p and i ordered down to a p the waist,0
100,I like the color and design of the pullover sweater so i bought it as a christmas gift for myself it arrives almost the same as the picture the only complain i have is that the size is a little larger than i expected however it still look good on me,1
101,This top is so beautiful really well made with solid embroidery not the thin lightweight type i thought it ran rather large but i dont have the bust to fill in the top area im usually a small in tops sometimes medium due to my height but went down to an xs so the arm holes didnt show too much length was still great a steal at the sale price,1
102,I love this dress ive received compliments from everyone its long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school and its beautiful,1
103,Love this top wore it for the first time today and it looks so good soooo flattering from the front the back is plain but ive got some back fat so i wear a jacket,1
104,I absolutely love this tank it goes great with a pair of jeans and cute booties great colors and material i love the nigh neck,1
105,A finely laced sheer bustier along with a gown split along the sides makes for a lovely sleeping garment the material is cooling and the lace is not itchy,1
106,I love these pants they are soft versatile and stylish great choice,1
107,Perfect shirt for a lowkey day at the office bought in the umbrellarain white print maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but thats what i love about them material is nice recommend hand wash,1
108,This vest looked so cute online but its a disaster the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesnt work properly and it just hangs itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie seriously its bad,0
109,High quality great color loved the neckline unfortunately a little too snug on me so it showed my bulges on waist and back not too snug if you dont have that problem i loved this shirt but had to return it,1
110,This top is very cute and appears in person just as it does in the picture fits true to size and the item is made well i had many complements and it was fun to wearunfortunately i did have to iron it right out of the bag,1
111,I had been waiting for this skirt to go on sale as i fell in love with the style and print on the website however after receiving it in the mail i was disappointed to find that the cut was all wrong for my body type i am size hourglassathletic the xs was too big and made me look like i had no shape would be cute on a girl with no hipsbooty but unflattering on hourglass figure,0
112,I love this dress even more in person than in the photo it is more sleek and fitted than it appears on the model the seams are flattering and the fabric is lovely,1
113,Very disappointed ordered two sizes the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldnt have worn it and the zipper was sticking the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under but at they are not returning both sizes,0
114,I bought this dress with a specific occasion in mind i could not turn it down because it fit like a glove i love the cut and the length,1
115,So i have had to return this once so far because the stitching ripped out when i sat down the little slip thing that goes underneath if cheaply made i really wish this were just lined dress i wear it with a blank tank top and leggings underneath not worth the money but i needed something to wear that was transitional,0
116,Great dress with just the right amount of movement and flow everywhere perfect to dress up for a night out or wear it casually during the day,1
117,This dress is amazing based upon its rack appearance i never would have tried this dress on but the fabric was irresistibly soft so i gave it a try i was amazed to see it fit so well im very curvy lbs dd so normally a dress without structure doesnt work on me but this one somehow does the elastic waist hits right at the smallest part of my waist im very short waisted if that helps and flows from there beautifully i think the vcut at the chest area help reduce the appear,1
118,I just picked this up in store the other day i absolutely love it it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit,1
119,I dont normally spend so much on t shirts but this one is worth it really well made and quite unique i reckon ill get a lot of use out of it,1
120,Love this sweater not too long or bulkytrue to size the fabric is super soft great quality,1
121,Like other reviewers noted the pics dont do this skirt justice it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors cant wait to wear this to work,1
122,Easter mothers day teababy showerim and ordered a p true to size beautifully made flowy feminine i cant wait to wear this,1
123,I love this seriously would buy again i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it,1
124,So i really like this sweater as youd expect for this price point its stylish in a very single way so glad i read the review before mine to size down the xs is great and i wouldnt want bigger i love the length how it goes long and cones in a little at the bottom and the pockets are higheri always need pockets for my phone the stripes are well draped as the sweater transitions from shoulder to arm the cuffs are fun too bottom line im really glad this came on sale and i snatc,1
125,I was hesitant to order these especially because they didnt have a petite since theres shipping and i thought i might have to return them i know that most shorts from retailer run a little big im usually a but in retailer bottoms i ordered the regular since there were no petites theyre not too high waisted i think they could have gone higher but theyre not low either love them theyre so fun and i cant wait to break them out,1
126,I was extremely disappointed when this arrived its nothing like the red color shown rather its a very dull reddish color as other reviews have suggested it is very thin and runs large i have to return,0
127,I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness such as myself i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting for me,1
128,Soft comfy flattering just a beautiful dress it works for any occasion i cant express how much i love it,1
129,This dress is perfection very flattering and pretty,1
130,Love the fabric and design of this dress very unique and comfortable it is not lined which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but were not uncomfortable they define the waist very well i am lbs athletic build and the fit,1
131,Hi ladiesdoes this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time yes did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls yes however i am a large chested girl d i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best most comfortable amazing non hurtingpoking best strapless bra i have ever owned i just bought three more just in case the first two wear out i love this i love how far it comes down on the sides i love that it doesnt slip do,1
132,I ordered both the black the dark grey the dark grey arrived first they are very comfortable flattering there is a nice thigh slimming effect i purchased the size small regular length they hit me at my ankle lbs i cant wait for the second pair to arrive,1
133,What an adorable print yes it may be a bit juvenile for someone my age but i dont care the toucans are rendered in soft primary colors the skirt is swingy but not poufy whole dress is lined so thankfully its not a see through white fabric the bodice in medium petite fits me just perfectly dd so if you are slender on top size down agree with the previous reviewer about the zipper which i find to be cheap and irritating especially when zipping over the waistband worried abo,1
134,The look quality and feel of this jacket is perfect it does run a large so i would order a size down i definitely worth every penny,1
135,Love this dress great for dressing up and down or just to throw on for the weekend the fit is very flattering but i will say the fabric is very thin so you must use a slip its totally see through,1
136,Im in love the cut fit and fabric of this jean have made it my favorite everyday pair theyre mostly rayon followed by equal parts polyester and cotton with a touch of spandex thrown in the right combination for fit softness and durability these hold their shape well so i dont have to wash them every other time i wear them the ankle length hits me at the top of my ankle bone perfect im pounds ordered size,1
137,If you are looking for the perfect tshirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together i am just waiting for more colors to come out i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt,1
138,I saw tons of people raving about this piece so i had to check it out for myself i love the vibrant colors and the design and while the fabric is delicate it feels amazing and light i sadly had to leave it as the store as i am a girl with a larger chest and big hips i looked huge and it was not flattering to my shape if this dress came in a maxi with a high waist like i would be all over it it is beautiful,0
139,I can tell already that this sweater is going to be in heavy rotation in my closet its a bit oversized and cozy but the ribbon tie makes it neat and not sloppy great with skinny jeans flares or leggings super cute with a cami underneath,1
140,Love this blouse i took a chance on ordering it and wasnt sure what i would think this blouse is fabulous it has a bohochic flair to it in a sophisticated way its one of those special pieces from retailer elegant quirky sophisticatedthe details are great too of course the embroidery is beautiful but there are a couple more fun details the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once when the cuff is r,1
141,I was really excited about this dress the style looked like it would be a springsummer staple in my retailerheavy wardrobe i was really surprised when i received it in the mail the dress is quite thin cotton fabric and feels cheaply made for the price i could purchase a much higher quality dress elsewhere that would hold up better ive been an retailer fan for more than an decade but this trend of higher prices for lower quality is disappointing and insirpring me to leave a review for the f,0
142,Love the look its a little tight but i still like it,1
143,From the picture i wasnt sure how it would fit got in the mail and i love it fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it definitely should of gotten a large,1
144,These are so cute i went into the store to buy something else and came out with these i usually wear a and bought a medium these are also lower price than i expected also well constructed thank you antho,1
145,Very elegant feel and look love the side zip sliming feature great all around pant to dress up with heals or boots for work,1
146,Beautiful detailed sweater when i tried it on i felt it made me look a tad bit boxy but once i pushed the sleeves up about six inches i loved the way it looked im wearing it tomorrow and know i will get lots of compliments,1
147,I looked at this on the hanger and almost passed it up im so glad i didnt because it ended up looking so much better on i wear a s or xs in retailer tops and went with the xs im and it still had plenty of room and enough length to cover my backside i usually gravitate to reds but the red in this top while pretty had too much pink in it for me,1
148,This is great on the model it looks largish but on me it doesnt if youre curvier like me e it may be more fitted long arms with great wrists design is just as shown not a sturdy piece but not cheap looking in any way i plan to handwash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time just what i want to wear on certain days and more colors would be great thanks retailer,1
149,Lovely warm sweater excellent quality fits as shown on model,1
150,I thought id be the exception these pants are super cute great fabric and color kind of loved them but they do run small by about one size just something to keep in mind while ordering other than that they are lovely wellmade pants,1
151,In the fall i purchased every single color of the left of center swing top long sleeve great colors and very easy to wear when i saw these i swooned these are very similar knit to the left of center but the swing is bigger and the linen insets on the side make this easy top even more beautiful these run true to sizebasically you are only fitting your arms and chest this top will definitely has a little give with wear which will just add to the shape and effortlessness the linen ins,1
152,Got the wine color and love it the design definitely is slimming lb got size,1
153,I see all the amazing reviews and on one hand i agree with them but these pants do run huge and they dont fit tailored like on the model on me they fit loose around the legs and thighs and theyre super wrinkly youll have to iron these after every wear and every wash im surprised to see the comment saying theyre wrinkle resistant they arent also the kahki is more grey which i dont love i got these on sale but even at i just cant justify keeping them theyre super comfy but,0
154,I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours love it its material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure its a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work,1
155,I have a holding horses dress similar to this one from about a year ago i loved the swinging fit without it looking like a maternity dress the fit and style of this dress is wonderful its the color that killed it for me i ordered the orange because i liked the photo on the model when the dress arrived in the mail i could hardly take it out of the package and try it on the color is almost neon orange too much for this redhead hard to wear that bright neony color not sure,0
156,This sweater coat is very bulky and has an odd and unflattering shape when on,0
157,Pretty blues colors are exactly as pictured fits perfectly not boxy not tight just comfortable im and this is tunic length on me,1
158,I love these jeans i have a few pairs of citizen jeans and like the way they fit these are a slim boyfriend jean not too baggy very flattering with any top loose or tight fitting wish retailer carried the white,1
159,I was able to snatch this dress up just before it sold out and i see its now back in stock the quality of the fabrics is outstanding not flimsy at all the top is stretchy normally i would wear a at retailer but the only choice i had was and it fit i am tall lbs everything about this dress makes me smile and i cant wait to wear it to my holiday party dont hesitate if you are on the fence,1
160,If i saw this online i would never have glanced at the picture twice instead i came across it at the store and immediately snatched it up to try on the green is very springy and rich while the raised little dots give it a lovely texture overall really adorable on and fits fine in the regular although i am usually petite,1
161,I ordered this in a l online and wasnt a fan when i received it the colors are pretty bright but they also look cheap in my opinion it also had an awkward fit because of the material there is no give at all it was really tight on my chest d for reference and it was also pretty short and im short it barely hit the top of my pantsand im back it went,0
162,This is a dress worth paying full price for based on the good construction and lacework i got it for an office event and although it is lowbacked the high neckline makes up for that no jewelry necessary with the high collar i am and lbs built like a column so i got the definitely not for fullfigured women unless you want it long very cool orange lining and buttons on the back vent,1
163,This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades it is very cute and the fabric is soft,1
164,Love this dress the color is gorgeous what you dont see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress i received so many compliments when i wore this dress the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight you can wear this dress year round i love these kind of dresses retailer knows how to do this right love this store,1
165,Big pockets make it look more like a bathrobe than a coat there are no internal pockets and the loops for the belt are pretty skimpy just a bit of string the color is great but the quality leaves something to be desired,0
166,These jeans are fantastic the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything my only small gripe is that the length is a bit awkward im and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans not anklelength just something to keep in mind if youre not super tall like the model in the picture,1
167,I would not have purchased this had i not seen it at my local hrs away store as the previous review mentioned the red is gorgeous very saturated color just lovely it does run large i am lbs i typically wear medium but chose small and could possibly have done xs but i wanted the extra length,1
168,Beautiful dress i just wore this dress for my wedding it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail there was one really big problem the beads and the flowers kept falling off i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere,1
169,Love the fit of pilcro jeans its always a struggle to find a white jean that is flattering around the thighs and doesnt show off lumps and bumps these are terrific quality indeed,1
170,I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse in pink in the store it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond in true floreat style it is well made and unique id say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit,1
171,This top looks exactly as pictured it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it i found that it ran true to size and i am lbs and ordered a small i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute,1
172,Fun light weight sweater for fall or sprint love the vibrant green color maybe for christmas the tieback makes it unique,1
173,This shirt is a steal at the sale price ive received many compliments it is a swing top so not a lot of form i wear a cami underneath have found the style to be comfortable for work,1
174,This skirt lookslays exactly like the photo i bought a size small and i usually wear a size it was maybe a smidge big but nothing that affected the look of the skirt the material reminded me of feltwool mixed together almost like sunday school felt cut outs but stiffer not a fan i was underwhelmed it looked plain and simple and the color washed me out definitely not worth the price for me anyways good luck,0
175,Love love love these pants super comfortable and fit true to size,1
176,Im feet tall so dresses are hard to find for me but the petite sizes fit accurately im very pleased with the dress,1
177,I bought this sweater to freshen up my fall wardrobe and just love it adds texture and warmth to every outfit,1
178,Was in dire need of black high rise skinny jeans bought these in a moment of treat yo self mentality absolutely do not regret it at waist typically a in denim i got the s as i found that they not only fit in the waist but were more slimming black denim typically stretches out in jeans as they are not of the same fabric these have a great weight perfect ratio of thicknessstretch look incredibly sleek paired with anything high rise keeps my belly in check and a,1
179,Love love these flannel sleep pants i bought a pair years ago and have been on the look out for the style again these are truly the most comfortable pajama pants i have ever owned,1

181,I would buy these pajamas in every color if offered they feel wonderful to the touch and even better on,1
182,I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package the fabric is extremely stiff and thin the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of childrens clothing i also ordered the matching pj pants but didnt even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater,0
183,I ordered in blue so excited at arrival it looked gorgeousthen i tried it on im d and my upper arms are a little muscular i normally order p sometimes pand never a problem this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper armsif i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams maybe i just received a product that was missized or defective all i can say if you have skinny arms youll love it,0
184,I bought this top in black it is high quality material and i love the mock neck and zipper in back however not only are the armholes are too large the shirt is cut too short if i size down for smaller armholes it becomes a crop top not a flattering look for something me i really wanted this to work but alas it went back,0
185,Size p is perfect for me a waist and hip with a lot of room left for a big dinner the design is exceptionally creative and attractive and the fabric is of very high quality,1
186,I love my new dress it is comfy classy and so easy to wear you can dress it up or down with ease im looking forward to seeing more styles from this designer i hope soon dont miss out on this dress its a must have for your wardrobe,1
187,Very soft color and soft to touch the material is light and airy and it feels great on i wear a medium and bought the small i would definitely buy this in another pattern if they made it as cute as the flamingos,1
188,I bought this top and it ran huge i had to get an extra small well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly like its so small now my yr old could probably wear it im so sad i really liked this topbut for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable,0
189,Im about somewhat of a pear and these jeans in size fit like they were made for me plus the fabric is really soft and comfortable and i love the color ankle opening is more straight than skinny which is a change from my usual skinny jeans but i like it,1
190,For reference i am lbs with an hourglass figure and my usual small fit perfectly the problems this skirt is not black but a charcoal graypurple the sipper is reinforces with a stiff boarder on the inside so no matter where i put the waist it sticks straight out making me look like i have a tail under my skirt in other words i had a very pointy butt also the slit or tulip part of the skirt goes all the way up to the waist it needed to be tacked to the other part of the skir,0
191,Really beautiful pants but run a very largei usually wear four and am the media was way too big in the waste and elsewhere and very long,1
192,These pants are awesome please make them in other colors besides black and navy,1
193,Could not resist the fit and detail on this piece couldnt wait for it to go on sale the material is so soft and comfortable its just a black sweater but the neckline and back details make it unique thought i would need a large but the medium fit fine lbs,1
194,This dress is lovely im tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like but im forcing myself to be economical i check regularly to see if its on sale however then theyre all minethis dress is soft comfortable classy and has the unique feature of having a lowcut back my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra this could be from my shape however because i am rather busty the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean its one o,1
195,I somehow overlooked this online and saw it in the store i am a or ml i tried on the medium and it was tight in the bust but fit great in the waist i ended up ordering the large online the large felt good but a tad big in the waist it hit my true waist though and looked good i then noticed the straps were agustable i wonder if i tried the medium and loosened the straps if it would have worked either way i love the dress so pretty and flowy i wasnt bothered by the fabric and did,1
196,Love it as a previous reviewer stated you can actually wear it reversibleso happy i purchased it,1
197,I love love love this dressits a quality well fitting jean dressthat you can dress up or downthe top portion dies run smallso of you are busy you might want to stay away from this dress,1
198,I saw this dress in the window at the portland store and had to try it on i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it onsort of like wearing a tent no shape at all one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress ive ever had on its romantic elegant feminine the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic i cant say enough about how amazing it makes me feel i wore,1
199,These pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride they fit true to size could not pass up as they were on sale,1
200,This tshirt hits at a great length not too long so it doesnt make me feel top heavy but it flows enough to hide any imperfections i ordered a medium,1
201,On me this top is totally frumpy and boxy i am dd and the bottom hung on me like a bedskirt not fitted at all i ordered a largenot being sure of fit i have a flat stomach and it just hungyuck honestly for the price and fit i wouldnt consider a medium i think it would a tad better but not worth the price,0
202,I originally bought this dress in the store however it ended being a size too big so i reordered the smaller size online although it was backordered for a month when it arrived i noticed the sleeves were not cinched like they are in the picture as well as the original dress i had purchased instore i thought maybe it had been a fluke so i returned the dress and reordered it again because it is a great dress the second one just arrived and the sleeves are not cinched as well this may,0
203,Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people too much fabric in the peplum part,0
204,I saw this online visited my local retailer found it it is the most beautiful shade of blue nicely textured material i am and pds i bought the xs and it fits perfect definately designed for us smaller busted gals,1
205,I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model and from the reviews i found it to be super big and unflattering to say the least im lbs i sent it back,0
206,I love hte green color it is so vribant i tried it on in regualr size thinking i could order petite but they sold out waht a bummerfit is very flattering and i find it comfortable,1
207,Very true to size im a smmed or my sizing varies widely at retailer and this was a perfect medium fitadorable with jeans or shorts or dress up with suit or pencil skirti have the bluegreen,1
208,I love these socks they are super thick and comfy the quality feels great and they were cheap,1
209,I just bought this dress today and it is absolutely stunning it looks so much better in person than on the model i think it runs true to size however it does have relaxed fit overall the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow without adding bulk great buy,1
210,It slips on easily is soft flattering it will definitely be my go to dress,1
211,This product is made of goodquality cotton material it does run a little large but it still fits nicely i like the fact that the design is both on the front and face of the garment,1
212,I ordered a size large however as a large my chest is large as well this nighty barley covered me in the chest region the rest of the body fit well,0
213,Ive had a hard time finding the right jumpsuit and havent ha a lot of luck with retailer clothing lately but this is perhaps my favorite retailer purchase of all time im petite and busty cd and was pleasantly supposed at how well this fits the pattern is a bit faded like the best kind of vintage find so it works for someone short like me and because the back has a tie closure it can adjust as needed ill be wearing it with a sports bra that crosses in back with straps whic,1
214,I love this top the wine color is beautiful the fabric is soft the details are pretty and it fits perfectly it is long and will likely look best with leggings or skinny pants and boots,1
215,For sizing i normally wear either xs or s in tops im lbs a i tried on both and both fit but the arm holes were a little too tight on the xs i ended up picking the s because it felt most comfortable when i tried on the ivory color i could see my blue bra underneath and it would require a cami the black didnt i love the embroidered design and ruffled neck i agree the buttons on the back of the neck are a tad difficult to button but its not a deterrent,1
216,This dress has beautiful lines i loved the design on the material but the fabric looked very cheap even was already snagged when it arrived unfortunately i must return it,0
217,The other reviewers have already adequately praised this very attractive sweater but id like to add that the sizing is large i fit perfectly into a regular small although regular medium is my usual size i am f size top the medium swamped me the shoulders and sleeves were comical and the body too big i imagine many of you are scoping out this lovely comfy piece youll want to hit the right size the first time my store didnt get the coral so i cant speak for that b,1
218,Like some other reviewers i too have to comment on the dresss fit the dress doesnt fit right around the bust or the waist as a seamstress myself i know that the problem is that it doesnt have any darts in the bust and thus the bust and the waist are just about the same size this dress really just needed a few of these extra hidden details to fit right while a belt helps i dont think it helps enough to justify the price its too badi think the concept of it is cool and i was rea,0
219,Love the fit of this sweater it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model it hits me just below the hips for ref im im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable could be dressed up or down runs true to sizeim always a small and this fits perfectly roomy,1
220,Unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size for reference im lbs b cup and took an xs top fits comfortably no tightness around the chest and sleeves fullness isnt overwhelming the lace is see through so a cami is a must top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship i have not laundered it yet so i cant comment on that so happy with my purchase a keeper for sure,1
221,I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans my favorites are the cords i got last year similar to these so when i saw this fun pair i had to have them i ordered both the and the to try onthey are even more beautiful in person than online and they are so so small it wasnt like they were a tad snugi couldnt even get the button across to meet the buttonhole on the ive never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before this was an extradepressing first time,0
222,This dress is just beautiful color fit length style stretchy fabriceverything about it seems to flatter all body types it also passes the armhole test no issues there the back closure detail adds a little something special to it i tried it on with black leggings and a black leather jacket just for fun and it looks surprisingly cute for multiseason wear is it overpriced absolutely but so is of the stuff at retailer i will be keeping it anyway though because i think its a tr,1
223,Great sweater to brighten those gloomy winter days this is a beautiful sweater soft colorful perfect,1
224,These are so comfortable and surprisingly flattering i bought the taupe in sp for reference im lbs curvy on bottom i was afraid it would give me a bubble butt and it didnt could be dressed up with right shoesaccessories,1
225,This is just as it looks a minimalist elegant dark navy skirt that provides a classic feminine shape and looks like it could last for years it is straight so you might want to consider sizing up unless youre quite slender im and and am sending back a m for a l excited to get my new skirt and to wear it,1
226,I bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle womens clothing and these were perfect they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day i also wear these to work on fridays i bought a size and they fit great i usually wear a in us sizing,1
227,This dress fits comfortably with great fabric and feels sturdy without to much weight i love the color the fit would be flattering on many different body types i would highly reccomend this dress,1
228,This is a beautiful dress the photos do not do it justice the pink is gorgeous its also very comfortable but runs large im usually a or an but purchased a,1
229,I wish i had read the reviews before purchasing online i love how this top looks online but when i tried on the small that i ordered it was comical so so boxy literally shaped like a square it must be pinned back on this model maybe if i ordered an xxxxs it would have workedor perhaps for a larger person it may look super cutejust didnt work on my slim build,0
230,This shirt is thin and shapeless the quality is hm esque unflattering not a fan,0
231,This is a perfect fit i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy i usually wear an xs i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming this was perfect it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about great value at the sale price as well it is well made and doesnt just look like a run of the mill pullover,1
232,I think this jacket is meant to be large on for a particular look with an xs i had no problem its large but slouchy and cute i adore it,1
233,This skirt is so ladylike and light as air the cherry red color is beautiful just as pictured i can imagine so many opportunities to wear this skirt with a sweater and tights now and maybe a striped tee and sandals in the springim sure ill have this gorgeous classic in my wardrobe for a very long time to come,1
234,I purchased a large and it fit perfect im a size dd the material is very forgiving and flows over my curves thick enough that it doesnt need a slip and will stretch to fit size ladies maybe size too im and the length is great on me with flat sandals doesnt show my bra either,1
235,I have a short torso and short arms so i purchased this in a petite medium i probably couldve worn the ps but i do like the little extra room it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of todays trendy frayed edge to make it contemporary the fabric is super soft and lays nicely i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoeslegwear accessories looking forward to it,1
236,I got a small lbs and it fits great it is super comfortable and also looks really good on,1
237,This is a beautiful top which runs tts and armholes are not too big for once i typically struggle with armholes being way too big on me and have to size down in most tops and this top runs tts and armholes are perfect no bra showing beneath yay it is a beautiful color and design just love it i am a typical size and size was perfect i am c and no problems in bust area works well with my short torso highly recommend i think it will look great on all body types,1
238,This is the second sweater ive purchased recently that i overlooked online but fell in love with once i tried it on it is extremely flattering and the length is perfect i will be wearing this a lot i am lbs and the medium fit perfectly,1
239,This dress looks very good on me its a cute way to appear dressy without the extra work to look the part,1
240,Very small so disappointed they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived,0
241,I wasnt going to even try to see it this dress would fit it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model im so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it my outfit is a floppy straw hat skinny leather belt and flat sandals theres a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out i ordered the medium petite and i am dd,1
242,I purchased this piece in store in a size small ivory i am usually a size medium but the small fit perfect material is soft lightweight and very comfortable collar can be buttoned to create more of a turtleneck look or unbuttoned to create less of the same look im so glad i grabbed this because it is a great cold weather staple and i doubt they will last long,1
243,I adore this blouse i bought it in the blue at my local store and ordered the white so cute be careful i dried my blue one i openly did not read the care instructionshaha and it shrunk a little still beautiful though,1
244,This top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms however it does have a roomy fit so you might want to size down as a petite person i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles overall comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color,1
245,I love this top the sizing was great and i have already worn it so many times and received so many compliments it is great to dress up or down such a great purchase,1
246,Absolutely love this in blue the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape the colors and pattern are accurate on screen vibrant and rich the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy very happy with this purchase,1
247,I love this pretty sweater i am petite and thin and ordered the regular xs the length was perfect just below the hips the sleeves are a bit long but you can pull them up a bit this is a perfect winter dressy sweater to wear with black jeans or leather pants the knit is very delicate and light but warm and the layered chiffon bottom makes it special,1
248,I wore this dress to a couple different summer parties already and i love it it looks better belted on my curvy frame i really like that the straps are adjustable and the versatility of this dress perfect lightweight material in this summer heat im not sure why reviews say its sheer its not sheer at all the fabric isnt hugging your body at all and you just need nude colored undergarments,1
249,I am in love with this dress not too dressy not too casual and hugs the body in all the right spots i am with curves and this flatters well i also bought and adore the velvet taupe ankle strap shoes they show with them super inlove with the whole look dress will look great with booties too just hope i dont snag the sweater dress which looks easy to do because i want to wear this all fall and winter long,1
250,These pants look great on and i love the ponte fabric on the back of the pants i usually wear a in pilcro but i went with a for these great length and my only criticism would be the price a little expensive for vegan leather,1
251,Perfection fits like other pilcto jackets and vests tapers in slightly at waist for flattering fit weight is light for summer but substantial and good quality silver buttons not bronze or copper slight stretch super comfy no regret,1
252,I got the small even though i usually order a medium for sweaters because i prefer them bigger and im glad i got the small the sleeves are very long which i love and the sweater is also loose fitting also love the color is gorgeous and it is thick but super soft i wouldnt wear anything underneath it unless tucked in because the front just comes to the top of my pants overall its gorgeous and i would definitely recommend this,1
253,I had my eye on this jacket in moss for awhile i was afraid the vegan leather wouldnt feel natural or soft but i was wrong its wonderfully soft so much so that every time i wear it and tell someone its vegan leather they feel compelled to touch it and cant get over the quality the detailing is great and the back adds a special interesting touch its become my goto jacket and works just as well with jeans as it does with a nice dress and who doesnt love getting a compliment every,1
254,This shirt runs large in my opinion i wish i would have sized down to a xs but maybe it will shrink a little when i wash it its a great shirt good quality and im very happy i got it,1
255,Absolutely gorgeous i bought my regular size m and while its a little wide in the shoulders it drapes beautifully because im so short i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so its still elbow length and while i was there she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame cant wait to wear it its a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet so elegant very gatsby,1
256,I absolutely love this dress the color is beautiful the fit is flattering and it is so comfy i didnt want to take it off until bedtime it is an all around winner if i could do one thing to make it absolutely perfect i would take and inch or two off the hem i am think of doing that but seriously i am not sure i want to have it out in alterations when i could be wearing it it is just too comfy and cute,1
257,I love the fit of this sweater i recently had a baby and am a little selfconscious of my stomach area the sweater in my usual size s hides my problem area without being big and boxy the weave seems like it will be prone to snags so ill have to be careful,1
258,If they still have your size grab it fits a bit snug in chest but material is light and airy got so many compliments on it great style,1
259,This is one of those pieces that are timeless special and absolutely stunning the body of the jacket is quilted very boxy and the embroidery and beading on the jacket is what makes it absolutely gorgeous the inside of the jacket is this super soft incredible fleecy fur it adds to the luxury of the jacket in regard to fit its very boxy if you live near an retailer i would highly recommend popping in to try it on i personally wish it was a smudge longer but i think the detail and style of,1
260,I bought this in rose and i really like the jacket the color is not rose but the picture is accurate it is more terra cotta as previous reviewers said it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist i think it looks better buttoned but i do wear it open as well,1
261,This dress is so soft flowy and comfortable the material is very smooth and silky im hoping it holds up well over time with washing i am lbs and i ordered a xs the elastic waist is a tad tight but otherwise it fits perfectly just as shown on the model in terms of length and how the top fits i said it runs a large because normally i would order a s but i think if i did it would be too long and the arm holes might be too big,1
262,This is the little black dress ive been looking for for years great slim fit runs small i usually get sized out but the was a snug fit eyecatching design like the other reviewer i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier but overall a chic dress,1
263,Love this dress the colors are stunning the make is beautifuli dont know where to start the body part is a nice neutral color and has beautiful beading my concerns is snagging since the fabric is so flowy and the beading pokes out sort of i love that they used different patterns on the layers the skirt bottom layer has cute polka dots that are translated on the sleeves bottom of the sleeves sleeves are by the way fun and bubblelike the cut of the dress is not following the b,1
264,I am a shopperi shop a lot this is one of my favorite dresses of all time so unique and as others have said like a piece of art the fit is tight through the middle but thats what makes it look so perfect i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike i love it,1
265,Just bought this top in an xs and i canampt wait to wear it iampm amp and pounds i usually stick with the petitie tops but the regular one fit me perfectly you might need to wear a cami as it is a little see through a great addition to my wardrobe,1
266,I just recently received this dress in the mail i went up a size to a i am usually a or it fit perfectly the top is very fitted and the bottom flows nicely i really like this dress and am looking forward to wearing it to work or out,1
267,Super soft and flattering fit im feet inches and petite was the perfect length,1
268,I love the details of this top from the pleating to the sleeves the pommed edges and the black lace at the bottom the material is soft and comfortable the fit is flowy and the details are feminine yet simple its light weight which will be nice in warm weather and let me say once more how much i love the sleeves,1
269,I love this vest get compliments every time i wear it its stretchy too unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there so little tip dont spill on it lol my fault though so still stars,1
270,This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material it also runs large,1
271,I purchased the blue stripes and the black cat prints on sale and im very pleased they each fit me a little differently as the black cats fit tighter through the arms the stripes remain a bit looser throughout no complaints here i like the variation i ordered a size small as im normally a size small c lbs,1
272,I was so happy to discover that my size petite had suddenly become available again onlineprobably someones return and i wasnt disappointed when i tried the tunic onit fit great unlike other recent online purchases from retailer love the plaid and the style the cut should flatter many body types definitely worth the moneyplease retailer expand your inventory in petite sizes the cute stuff sells out so quickly,1
273,I was attracted to this sweater because of its unique style i really love it it looks just like the picture it is of good quality as is the leather belt it is the perfect fall sweater and i love that its different i highly recommend this sweater,1
274,As soon as i pulled these pants from their packaging i feel in love with them the fabric was so soft i could not wait to get them onyeah that was not going to happen i could not pull them on not even a little bit these pants run incredibly small i ordered them twice once in my regular size and again in a larger size unfortunately i am sized out of these beauties,0
275,Such a beautiful flattering dress i bought this to wear for our anniversary dinner and received so many compliments,1
276,Very cute top but it is wide and runs large it is very flattering with skinny jeans and the color is a beautiful navy almost a hint of purple i would consider a size down may run on the short side for those with longer torsos,1
277,This is a great sweater just to throw on with jeans or a skirt simple and the tie on the back gives it a feminine flare,1
278,This is a beautiful dress it fits true to size i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body i am and it falls to the knee on me longer than pictured on the model the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons the print is pretty and romantic im planning to wear this to my daughters very informal wedding and know ill be comfortable and look put together this was a lucky find,1
279,This dress is wonderful word to the wise it says that you can machine wash the dress on cold which i did the dress came out fine but the slip is now basically a shirt there are no washing instructions on the slip but i assumed it would be the same it is not it still looks ok under the top part but i will have to wear a half slip under the bottom,1
280,This is one of my favorite new retailer buys originally got the green for a family holiday party and went back for the sapphire the cut and design are great for reference im lbs and a a the light weight fabric is perfect for so cal winter but the real winning features is the detail so so cute only complaint is it wrinkled fairly easily but ill deal with that for a cute formfitting but not too fitting top,1
281,I ordered this dress with great expectations after coveting one in a store but unfortunately it did not work for me the fabric is a stretch cotton jacquard which is absolutely beautiful and the colors are gorgeous i do not think it runs big i sized up and it still fit me like a sausage casing if you are tall and thin with no bulges this dress is for you,1
282,This swimsuit is aaaahmazing seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order i am usually a or a chest size d and i ordered a in this and it fits perfectly taking it out of the package i wasnt sure if it would fit but it did the keyhole is pretty open and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen i got it in black and its really sohpisticated but still sexy and cool i ca,1
283,After reading the reviews i decided to size up to a m instead of a small so glad i did the arms are a tad long but other than that it fits perfectly love this in yellow,1
284,I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on it got stuck at my hips im a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible its going back now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me wish i had read them before purchasing retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one,0
285,Love the fit feel and colors of this tee looks great with white jeans blue jeans and is so springy longer in length than most tees which is a plus for me may run a tad small since i am usually an xs in most tops but i bought a s and love the fit,1
286,This tee is very comfortable and the colors are amazing i initially purchased in the marigold yellow as i was instantly drawn to the color in store its a beautiful shade that will transition nicely into fall ive since purchased the green which i liked on even more so than on the rack overall a nice quality everyday tee the pocket and embroidered neck make it something retailer,1
287,I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for springsummer for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown this dress has no shape to it although probably comfortable not flattering i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture in person,0
288,I absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year like last year these do run big so do size down the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors love these and highly recommend these,1
289,Love this blouse the owl design is flawless front to back the material has a silk like feeling i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you also i am a c and the chest fit well in size large but would not offer much more room for a larger chest if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows i would size up i love the unique design,1
290,This is a very retailer piece i love it i wish retailer would bring back more pieces like this anyway the details on this sweater are so special the sweater is sturdier and warmer than i thought it would be which is a plus i love the drape it has to it down the front one slight dislike is that the shoulders seem a little tight in my usual small but considering this sweater is completely sold out i will make it work love it,1
291,I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about lbs,1
292,Material is slightly thin good transitional dress for spring or fall the waist is not quite as fitted as i would like but the neck and sleeves are perfect the length is good but i am short and lbs xs fit pretty well a really good purchase more of a workhorse work dress and not a wow dress on me but nice to pair with blazers jewelry dont regret the purchase very comfortable got compliments when i wore,1
293,Too thin at bottom where lace is couldnt sit in the dress without worrying i was hanging out,0
294,Ive been looking for a more polished edgy alternative to my jean jacket and this is perfect its super soft and comfortable will look awesome over a dress or with jeans love it,1
295,Great flattering fit lovely light fabric classy with an edge getting another one the other color stripes on the taupe one are navy,1
296,Adorable dress amazing fit,1
297,This sweater looks great with chambray colored denim i wear it with jeans shift dresses and even leggings definitely one of my go to sweaters for the fall,1
298,I ordered this top in the pretty sea glass green color it is adorable on its constructed from a nice thick cotton and has a billowy swing look if you are into that which i am the cut of the neckline gives it a cool s vibe my only issue is that the arm holes are cut small also note that because of the wider neckline i found putting a necklace on squashed it in a strange way im still keeping it because it is awesome in every other aspect most likely i will just jazz it up with fun e,1
299,I love maeve but this shirts quality was poor and it was not worth the price i would not recommend buying this online you really need to try the blouse on in the store to make the decision as to if its worth purchasing or not and in my case this is being sent back,0
300,I bought this dress for the summer but it will transition nicely into the fall with a sweater leggings and boots the color and pattern are pretty and without being washed out the macrame belt is absolutely beautiful it doesnt show up well in the picture but is intricate and artistic seems sturdy as well i cant wait to wear it out,1
301,This top is so pretty and feminine i love how the design and quality of this top,1
302,This dress is lovely i tried it in the red and the black decided to keep the red as i have so much black going to wear to a spring wedding i will feel so comfortable and appropriate just looking for a great statement necklace,1
303,Love this sweater beautiful detail thicker yarn and well made sweater has more structure to it than i had anticipated which makes it look more tailered while being soft and comfortable hits my lower hip and im receive compliments every time i wear it,1
304,Im so happy to add this lovely and unusual dress to my fall wardrobe i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on i wear a two or four depending on the designer and the two fit me perfectly another reviewer said its special occasion only but i like it so much ill wear it more often with that said its a wonderful goto dress for the holiday season,1
305,I was on the fence about this top because i dont typically do longer tunic styles however it really is quite lovely i paired it with long jeans wedge sandals and a delicate necklace so pretty it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length,1
306,It is a beautiful sweater but it is cropped and boxy,0
307,Buy it buy it right now this dress is gorgeous and would be on anyone i dont care what size you are its so pretty that you feel pretty in it i loved wearing it and since i am in florida i can wear it all year long so its worth it happy very happy with this purchase,1
308,I love these pants they are very flattering they do however run long so even though im the regulars were crazy long on me and the petite fit me perfectly i was worried they would stretch out a lot but ive worn them twice and they havent,1
309,Soft and feminine pretty pastel colors very romantic the fit is flattering and feminine the fabric is light the lining is soft color is pale and i may need a little brighter colors but i might let that pass i am on the fence only based on color otherwise gorgeous dress the fit me well but the back touched the ground so i would probably order petite front is higher so no issue there dd in waist lbs for reference with,1
310,I bought this top in black and love it the crossed straps in the back give it a stylish twist i also tried it in white and found it to be a little see thru,1
311,Pretty blush color that is still neutral enough to wear with just about any outfit runs true to size imo cant wait to wear it this fallwinter,1
312,I couldnt even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd the arms cut off short and the seams dont hit your shoulders where they should all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering moving around in it was not easy i will return this one,0
313,I am writing this because my experience with this blouse differs from that of the other reviewers compared to all my other maeve blouses this top fits true to sizeslightly larger than usual its widerboxier than it appears online and the arms are totally normal in fact quite roomy on me all the other reviewers thus far have complained of very tight armsbust and had to size up i am having the opposite dilemma given the extra width due to the cut of the blouse and the fact that the,1
314,I love this skirt i feel in love with it instore and when i couldnt stop thinking about it a few weeks later i knew i had to get it beautifully made with high quality materials and so flattering fits very well for my figure big butt and hips w small waist sits just below my belly button and accentuates my waist and slims my hips must have,1
315,I saw this blouse referenced online a few times and have a weakness for white blouses so off i went to my local retailer this blouse turned out to be delightful my thoughts i would say it fits true to size as a fits me perfectly in the shoulders it is a flowy tunic blouse that has a high skit so its not possible to wear this as a dress it is very sheer too i do think this blouse is designed for the line to hit below the bust so my incredibly flat chest works in this if you have even,1
316,I love these little socks and the dots sparkle i wear them with my heels and leggings or jump suit pants when i dont want a higher sock or kneehigh stockings,1
317,I bought this dress in three different patterns i love it so much i am and around pounds usually a size six or eight in dresses ordered the small and fits perfectly if a little bit curvy frame great for women on the busty side fits beautiful and is stretchy but not too clingy,1
318,I loved this classic bomber jacket online and in the brochure sent to my house so i was thrilled to see it in my local retailer store i anticipated that i would need a large but i was wrong the m fits perfectly fyi c broad shouldersback short waist size in buttonup or fitted topsand dresses usually and a m in a loosefit or knit topthe m fits me just like the model in the photo so i would think that you are between sizes like i usually am you should size down the z,1
319,This dress is an absolute attention getter its incredibly unique and fits beautifully im very short and often have problems pulling off this much pattern but this dress was just right,1
320,The color heft style quality are perfect i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist,1
321,So cute a definite add for this summer sizing and pattern are both onpoint would be cute with so many bottoms,1
322,More of a legging than a true pant fits really well grey color is great and will go with lots of things,1
323,This is very unique and stylish the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable it is pretty warm it does not itch me at all as others have noted,1
324,I love this dress wearing it is the equivalent as wearing your coziest tshirt there is stretch up top if your chest needs it the neckline is modest the stripes and geometric pattern are flattering and vibrant but not gaudy in the slightest the length is perfect with the shortest part at my knee silhouette is tight at the natural waist and flares out in the most flowy and flattering way i got the large i am and fluctuate between lbs,1
325,I loved the moss so much had to go back to get the gold these chinos look wonderful on they can be dressed up with pumps and a blouse as well as dressed down with sneakers and a tshirt very versatile,1
326,Similar to the previous reviewer im also between sizes and for pencil skirts its usually the larger size that end up fitting whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch my smaller size fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip the fabric is wonderful the skirt length is great for work and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit,1
327,The lighter tinted denim is a faded bluegrey that will go perfectly with most of my wardrobe and is more summery than the usual dark denim i wear these feel like stretchy jeans to me not leggings i wear size in most jeans and these fit tts really nice,1
328,Love the colors for fall feels good and perfect for work size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night perfect,1
329,This dress is great wear now and into fall with boots and leggings it seems to have structure with the seams and is nicley flowy,1
330,This dress is very versatile and flattering on ive already worn it out to casual cocktails with friends twice since ive gotten it im and lbs and the petite worked perfectly on me,1
331,The combination of vintage and bohemian styles seems as if it would be flattering on all figure types and i love the combination of smaller and larger prints the only thing i didnt like is that on the blouse i received placement of the larger print on the bodice is asymmetrical unlike the photo it might not bother some customers but it wasnt what i was expecting so i ordered a new one i may keep it even if the second one is off because other than that small thing i think the top wou,1
332,This dress is my new best friend ive been looking for work dresses that dont require much effort in putting together an outfit and this is just it the pattern is fun and unique i got many compliments the cut is comfortable flattering and feminine the dress really speaks for itself and all i have to do is throw it on and run out the door the only negative is there was a loose piece of thread at the bottom fingers crossed this doesnt lead to problems later on and the sleeve buttons,1
333,This is such a comfy top and the fabric is really great more supple flowy than i expected it does run larger than i expected i typically wear a large and its almost more billowy than i would normally prefer i would love to try a medium to see the difference but since it was purchased online im just going with it this will get lots of wear this season,1
334,Love everything about this top comfortable yet classy dress it up or down depending on occasion beautiful design,1
335,This caught my eye straight away and it hasnt disappointed on either really unique and i imagine it will suit many different occasions high quality and slimming vertical stripes too,1
336,These pants are so comfortable its ridiculous they are lightweight and perfect for springsummer at the office or an evening out i am and the pants fit as pictured i paired with a sweater and kitten heels they do run a little large so consider going down a size,1
337,These could barely fit over my calf and did not even broach my knee i have big calves but i am otherwise i slim and normal sized woman these are way too tight and narrow to enjoy or to get much use out of,0
338,I do not understand how a couple people gave this a bad review i loved this jacket from the minute i tried it on cute in the picture and cuter on because it is so comfortable the fabric is super soft and does not wrinkle as one reviewer stated i took it on the plane with me just to keep warm and it was fabulous looked as good going on the plane as it did coming off the drape of the jacket flows nicely and i love the oversized pockets to stash my phone or lipstick this jacket will carry,1
339,My favorite of the season i purchased the grey sweater while shopping with girlfriends i love it so much ill be purchasing the brown as well i would normally wear a ml but tried it on and purchased a s i dont like very fitted items however a small fit perfectly on me this item runs big,1
340,I bought this earlier in the summer in size xl ive gotten such good use out of it the fit on me matches the model the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch not your typical hoodie but just the same comfort ive washed in cold in my machine air dried it hasnt shrunk one of my favorite purchases perfect for chilly weather or when you go into ac areas would love this in other colors great piece,1
341,I saw this at a store today and am so glad i tried it on im usually xs in retailer tops but for this shirt i preferred s for a loose fit the lace detail is elegant and very pretty,1
342,This dress is very flattering comfortable and made me feel pretty,1
343,I saw this online and decided to go to the store to have a look at it in person i was not disappointed at all it is so gorgeous i purchased the burgundy color and have received so many compliments it is very well made i am lbs and purchased a small i think some others mentioned it falls short in back but on me it falls well passed my bottom maybe they purchased a petite,1
344,Hilike the other reviewers i expected the price to be much higher it is so warm yet so flattering and cute this will sell out so buy now if you want it,1
345,Purchased this in white specifically because i loved the back detail i dont know why most designers overlook the back huge disappointment the back is totally plain not at all like the picture of the white top on here and the fabric in the back isnt even the same material as the front its almost as if the back is made out of leftover lining from another garment it was a very sad return i usually love this brand this was just a quality control oversight i guess,0
346,I am in love with this sweater i am and wear a size and bought a large perfect length and fit will wear with jeans or leggings the quality was amazing and i cant wait to wear it,1
347,This is a really great tunic purchased it in black and it is very flattering i love the side slit detail the material may seem very casual but it is extremely comfortable and can be dressed up im lbs and a s fits perfect,1
348,This jacket is perfect and drapes very well i had my eye on it online and the second i put it on it was a yes if you are between sizes as one reviewer mentioned size down its tts but has a little extra room for me on the so i sized down to lbs,1
349,I agree with the other reviewer that the green is brighter in person which was a happy mishap the p makes this look just like depicted on me in terms of proportion so beware that this borders on too long for petites my not small chest made me look pregnant but it fit well regardless adding a wide belt made this dress look amazing on me and shortens it to a more flattering length this is a miracle asis because im very shortwaisted keeper,1
350,This is adorable i got it to wear on the plane for an upcoming vacation this is definitely tts i am normally a medium and got the medium i am long wasted and this fit just fine looks like it does on the modelthe material is super soft too it is also easy to get on and off which is sometimes difficult with rompersplan on wearing it with gladiator sandals and a jean jacket,1
351,This dress is super comfy and really cute i was worried that the horizontal stripes might not be flattering but they didnt make me look larger at all its great for casual wear but can easily be dressed up with a jacket and booties,1
352,I wanted to like this one really but it was just plain sloppy looking i returned it,0
353,I love the fit of this dress the fabric is thick and the shape of it is so adorable i usually dont like bright colors but i got it in red and its just so charming cant wait to wear it out,1
354,I love this dress it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size dresses i am small busted and a pear shape so i like the more fitted style of the top with the aline skirt i love the length hitting just below the knee it is flattering for my body type seems well made and at a good price point,1
355,This top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail fabric is soft not too sheer im usually an xs and thats what i kept in this top armholes not too low as in some for reference lbs,1
356,I found this top to be very beautiful and well madethe fabric is on the lighter side however for me that is a double plusit is great for layering with a cami underneath andor a heavier sweater on topand going towards spring it extends wearing timethe lace on the sleeves is beautiful and a pretty peek a boo effect if layered under another sweaterit s a subtle sexy top with endless possibilitiesi found it runs very true to sizei purchased the aqua and after receiving it i rushed t,1
357,Really comfortable leggings not see through and at a great price,1
358,Im a big fan of left of center as a brand and this top is definitely a winner the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tentlike highly recommend,1
359,When i saw this shirt i knew i had to have it i got the white with yellow flowers and the pattern is perfectly charming im and petite with a short torso the petite xs fit me perfectly the material is pretty thin so i hope it stays in good shape until then i cant wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days,1
360,I ordered my usual sizesmall it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler the material is very soft looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest,1
361,I love this dress i get so many compliments from strangers every time i where it must buy,1
362,I bought this top in colors white and light green i really like them both the shirt is a nice weight and texture and the soft green color is really nice the fit is true to size i am and lbs and the medium was perfect i like how the back dips in a slight v as well,1
363,This is a really elegant sweater coatthe faux fur trim adds a lot of flair and the mismatching color blocks on each side keeps things playful the material is soft and cozy but my one concern is that the threads can get snagged otherwise though its a winner,1
364,I bought this yesterday in store i agree it runs large and sizing down keeps it from swallowing you i typically wear a large and went with a medium love the grey color it will make a nice neutral am looking forward to wearing this well into fallwinter as im in the south where it takes a while to get cold,1
365,This is my third top from this designer and normally i wear a small but i tried this on in the store and the medium fit much better on me i am not partial to the black as the knot design was lost but the sapphire is wonderful works great with slacks or more casual clothes i liked the sleeve length as well im not too busty but i think that other reviews comments of the knot being see through could be a problem,1
366,This is so flowing and perfect to hide any flawsi adore it,1
367,I was able to try this one on at the store and it was so loose on me i assumed it was a large but no it was a small i usually wear size in dress size sm in tops admittedly it does pull over the head with no zippers or elastic to give shape but it feels like water on the skin and has just the right amount of show it plus coverage for wearing around the house im keeping it,1
368,This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer though it is kind of a dark navy i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern for my sisters graduation i paired it with a white,1
369,I love these jeans i am always reluctant to change brands but these are the best i was pleased from the minute i took them out of the package the fit is perfect very skinny but not too tight they retain their shape over several wearings too the color is a great dark navy looking forward to a long relationship with these its love,1
370,Looks great on the picture but when it arrived it was a great disappointment both the colors and style the material seems great quality but its stiff and scratchy the style is very boxy and as another reviewer said just hung im a brunette and the colors looked terrible on me back it goes,0
371,I was lucky enough to hit retailer day in san diego and snagged this little number it is truly better looking in person the dress hugs in all the right places and actually fits tighter than the model shows but the material is that soft but stretchy and gently molds to the shape of your body i was really surprised i would have never tried this dress from the photo shown so glad i went in its really adorable,1
372,The pictures of this dress do not do it justice i bought it cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted with a slim belt and it is perfect it actually becomes a very sexy dress it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night to be very honestwearing this to south beach it will be perfect with strappy high heels,1
373,I love this sweater timelessclassical with an edge i will have it until the end,1
374,I ordered this dress in the orange and it is a perfect addition for my closet its comfortable yet classy i did order a size up and went with the medium because i am a dd so glad i did because the top part of me stays secured if i went with the small i am afraid i would be falling out it is long but i will take to a tailor and have them make some adjustments its a versatile dress and can be worn at events or just for hanging out in,1
375,While the white version is a tad more twee this one in black is edgier more sophisticated tts for my chested broad shouldered self in a all the unique details add up to an outstanding versatile piece how it blouses out in back opaque enough to wear without a cami the scallopsi may keep both colors,1
376,I love the mustard color and fun boho details of this shirt however the sizing was a little weird i ordered the small petite first and it was just too short which is rarely a problem i have so i ordered it in the regular small its perfect in length but a little loose on top which im fine with overall very happy with this purchase and have received many compliments on it,1
377,I live in blue jeans and im extremely particular about style fit and fabric an eternal fan of ag i tried these on the recommendation of a sales association in the past week ive dressed them up dressed them down and wished i could wear them to work the wash is an especially versatile shade of indigo incredibly flattering fit if youre going to splurge on one essential this seasonthese paige jeans are definitely a candidate,1
378,I purchased this shirt in blue hoping it would be a basic addon to my wardrobe its been about a month and i have since washed and worn it twice the color is now fading and i found a hole in the front of the shirt im not sure if its the fine fabric that caused it to tear but i washed it on gentle cycle and didnt do anything that would have warranted a tear sadly this did not serve up to its purpose i wouldnt suggest paying the price tag or even sale price for an item that i dont expec,0
379,I love this cardigan it is very soft and unique i am a sucker for polka dots i tried on my usual size xs and it fit i wish they did have it in petite however added this one to my wish list soft versatile,1
380,Simple style with a great fit love the pink mustard and cream colors together fits true to size,1
381,This windowpane coat is so striking and it looks even better on than in the photos i love it it has great styling including the button placement the beautiful fall brown lining it is quite warm over a thin sweater the fabric is amazingly soft i get a lot of compliments on it two friends have already purchased it i normally might take a but a was just fine this is a great coat,1
382,Ive been looking for a great white blouse for awhile and this is it the tie waist is especially flattering for hourglass figures but im sure it would add some curves to any body type the fabric is soft not crisp and drapes beautifully you definitely will be doing some ironing though its a bit sheer but i always wear nude bras and felt no need for a cami i did buy the regular rather than petite sizing and usually wear a or but had to size up to a regular to avoid gaping in f,1
383,Disappointed the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs,0
384,I had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings im so i got the ml to ensure length maybe that was wrong if the laid flat width was included maybe that would have been more helpful but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack the side slits of course hidden in the photos came up to just over my natural waist enhancing that effect i loved the,0
385,Love marrakech for their jackets this piece is wonderful i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose the body still fits buttoned up nice and tailored the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk looks great worn open too i think the best part is the cut and material i am and lbs curvy,1
386,So this is actually a holding horses dress its mislabeled on the website tts a stunning vintage inspired piece very s but timeless the keyhole isnt too low cut this is appropriate for work beautiful drape and great lining this dress can twirl i am usually a xsmallsmall and went with the small fits perfectly though a bit loose in the waist but still very flattering the xsmall would have been too tight in the shoulders lovely dress,1
387,I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes my regular and one size larger when i got them i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect beautiful pattern and material light and airy sexy with the lowcut keyhole i am sooo happy with my purchase,0
388,I purchased this on a whim and im so glad i did this is a gorgeous piece fabric is soft very feminine and stylish quality is outstanding it can be worn with a dress or jeans lovely shades of pink and soft gray i live in florida so its a bit heavy for hotter weather but will be great on a cool spring day love it,1
389,This dress is gorgeous on the hanger and even more gorgeous on definitely runs big though so sizing down is probably best,1
390,This jacket is a neutral color with a subtle print that adds great character the stitching around the edges is cute the shape is very flattering and not too boxy as some open jackets can be a perfect layering piece,1
391,This is a beautiful and versatile skirt i love the layered detail length and flattering cut the fabric is a cotton linen blend its a thick weave with tiny nubs here and there the skirt was made in turkeyi usually wear a size in retailer skirts but i sized down to a in this skirt the size fit at my natural waist and looked as pictured on the model whereas the looked bulkier on me,1
392,I read the previous reviews and ordered down a size knowing that the shirt runs big i really wanted to love the shirt however it was a tent with all of the extra material in the back it billowed out in all the wrong places the material is comfy and its a very cute concept just didnt work for me,0
393,Kind of silky but to a point where they almost look like pj pants i am not sure if i will keep but overall nice feel i tried on a xxs p as it was a return xs sold out so went with it stretchy enough to fit me lbs,1
394,I absolutely adore this shirt it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe,1
395,This gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes the silk is light airy and very delicate the bodice runs large and the length runs long i have to wear my highest platforms but i would not return because its an exquisite piece of art,1
396,Love love beautiful soft great color very comfortable,1
397,I purchased this in purple and agree with previous reviewers whove mentioned that it looks more casual in person it can be dressed up with the right accessories though and the fabric is really excellent quality soft and durable i really like the contrasting plaid back its a subtle but fashionable detail,1
398,I bought the green and it is a dark teal the fabric is so soft and it can be dressed up or down the detail truly sets it apart from your boring tee great purchase especially at the sale price,1
399,Finally saw this dress online i have to say that it looks better in person the model might be too tall for this dress i am its right to my ankle the color is in a nice off white the material is a good quality the overall cut is nice its a kind of classic feelingyou could wear it for a long time without going out of style,1
400,Love this top tried it on in the store loved it more its a great transitional piece with rich colors the top is sheer so will need to layer with a camisole havent worn yet so cant speak to how well it will wash,1
401,Love love this tunic my size fits perfectly with a little room material is very soft and very comfortable could be worn with leggings or with a belt as a dressso many options so worth it,1

404,Love this skirt it looks precisely as the photo depicts the metallic stitching may be a little bothersome for some in terms of itchingscratching im quot and the fit perfectly pearhourglass,1
405,The design is gorgeous the fit is great and the fabric drapes beautifully and is very comfortable however its extremely see thru,0
406,I bought this top in the stripe and im ordering the black now its a nice top to transition from summer to fall even though the temp doesnt change much in texas it does run a bit large so size down held up nicely when washed hand wash cycle,1
407,Ive been waiting for this dress to come back in stock and when it finally did i got it in the size im typically a or in dresses and the fits perfect for reference im c lb i think it runs on a larger size because its a shift dress i would recommend sizing down a great white dress to wear to my rehearsal dinner,1
408,I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through but liked the dress enough to give it a shot it is soooo see through this trally could only be worn on a beach very disappointed,0
409,I purchased this in the pingorange color i am and lbs the medium fit perfectly very soft texture with a nice flow will be purchasing in other colors,1
410,So soft and comfortable i wish id bought the other colour too,1
411,I echo what the other reviews say this is a tshirt but its very flattering i bought the black and dressed it with a bright turquoise necklace and received a ton of compliments extremely comfortable ive been just looking for this shirt when i get home from work or having to do errands because it is that comfortableim buying more its so comfortable and flattering,1
412,Excellent quality i love this camisole with its muted shades of black based on other reviews i sized down from my usual to a size and the fit was perfect and no problems with the straps being to long a keeper,1
413,Just as pictured this little top is just too cute the fit is exceptional and quite flattering another very feminine top and the yellow color is perfect i love pairing yellow with black of coursebut also with reds bluesand it looks great with white pedal pushers i think they call them cropped now a days at any ratethis is a first rate top that i highly recommend,1
414,Love the top it fits perfectly i was a bit worried it would look like a pregnancy top on me as im a dd but it doesnt ive received many compliments on the top its incredibly well made and has beautiful detailing it is sheer so youll need something under the material is quite light as well which is nice,1
415,This top is beautiful i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture and its gorgeous the adjustable strap is nice there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top this is seriously my new favorite could not recommend enoughfor reference i am a a and purchased a small,1
416,Im and between lbs buying clothes from retailer is always a stuggle because i have a petite frame but i dont fall into the petite height range i usually order a petite size and just deal with the shorter length which is hard when youre all limbs i purchased a r and im in love with the fit the top of the dress fits under my arms perfectly the waist of the dress also hits nicely usually the waist of regular sized dresses falls below my natural waistline due to my short,1
417,Tried and bought this in the store loved it my normal size worked great little word to the wise be careful zipping it up which is a little tricky the first one i grabbed had a broken zipper just takes a little work getting it up bc the fabric is thicker,1
418,This top isnt straight as it would seem on the tuckedin picture on the model colros are really rpetty and neutral in eprson fabric si very soft i tried on the but am wondering about trying on or petite sizewhich i would have to order so will wait a bit on this one,1
419,This top runs super small in the upper arms shoulder areacould not even stretch out my arms other then that major problem the length and body fit were perfecti am true med andor large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes and neither worked for me due to armshoulder fitdisappointed because it really is a beautiful top,0
420,I got this in a petite xs its gorgeous and incredibly soft great quality as well my one little caveat is that its very short im with a short torso and it still didnt get very far on me but if you wear it with highwaited pantsskirt its not a big deal,1
421,This is my favorite dress ive bought in the past year it is super flattering and can be worn for work or casual wear the fabric is soft and comfortable cant wait till the weather gets warmer so i can start wearing it regularlyim lbs i got the medium petite and it fits perfectly,1
422,Im a and i got a large and the dress fits nicely through the hipsseat im kind of pear shaped so its a bit large through the top but i intend to layer another knit top under it so thats ok i didnt want the knit dress to be too tight or else it would stretch out after sitting i like the colors and the fabric the weave is loose and after snagging it on my glasses taking it off im careful with it it will be nice into fall with a sweater,1
423,I like the color blocking of this top but it was too large and billowy on the bottom it felt like a pregnancy top so i had to return it as it gave me no shape,0
424,This top is fabulous the color is amazing and the back is just beautiful i would recommend this sweater to anyone i absolutely love it my only concern is getting it snagged on something other than that its a score,1
425,This is the third jumpsuit ive ordered and written a review for this season this jumpsuit is the best by far i bought it in my usual size small d and it fit me even though im tall i would say it looks much the same as it does on the model maybe an inch shorter in the legs on me love that the legs are rolled up by a tab and a snapno uncomfortable elasticized legs i am more legs than long torso i usually wear a inseam with flats the jumpsuit is very easy to g,1
426,I purchased this in the purple which is more blue than purple but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light its a beautiful rich indigo color its very comfortable i usually go for more fitted styles but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting im very excited to wear this top this summer i havent worn and washed it yet so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing i am,1
427,Love this top bought it in the relish color loved it so much bought the green too usually wear a small but the medium was perfect,1
428,These pants are so comfy wellfitting and flattering i will order the same style in more colors and patterns because i can tell this will be my uniform this summer true to size if you like a close fit like i do size up if you like a loose fit length is shorter than caprimore like a s pedal pusher cute,1
429,The skirt looked orange online but is more of a nice red i do like orange too thoughi had orginially palced this in my basket as a to order later to see but my store had it glad because i would have ordered petite adn i do think that would have been too short for me not appropirate for work or in my opinion my age the skirt size regular fit my waste and fell about one inch above my knee i am lbs if it helps so petite would have been shortthe only thing tha,1
430,This is a beautiful skirt great soft draping fabric fringed along the edges i ordered size large which was an okay fit perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist because i carry my weight in the tummy this made me look wider than i am as an elder i just couldnt handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee i have great legs but my knees arent their best feature so sadly returned but i do recommend,1
431,I bought these pants in the green and in black they are the most comfortable work pants ever almost as if you are wearing leggings and not pants the material is really thick hiding any imperfectionsthe satin detail allows for them to be a little more dressy i am and and i ordered a they are a little large in the waist but a perfect fit everywhere else the also hit right below my ankle bone i highly recommend these pants for anybody who is on the go for there job a lot because,1
432,I love the way this dress fits and flows it does run big i normally wear size in retailer dresses had to downsize to p for reference im and c the pink color is shade darker than shown in the picturesthere was a tear in fabric along the zipper called for replacing the dress the sales rep was very pleasant agreed to send another one,1
433,Love the top this is an attractive black top with a unique back which will match pretty much any thing in ones closet yes i would say it runs a size bigger however it does not take away from the quality nor design,1
434,The dress has a partially sewnin slip which really didnt work for me no matter how much adjusting i did i couldnt get the slip and dress to sit properlyi ordered a medium and if it hadnt been for the slip the fit would have been good the length was as pictured for reference i am lbs ddd,0
435,I waited so long before trying this on because i have a bad addiction to whitecream tops that im trying to get over and branch out but after seeing someone else wearing it i decided to give it a whirl i was also trying on the black and white charlies with the leaf print at the time and fell in love it hits me a lot longer than the modeled photo im about for reference and the shoulders were a little tight for me in my usual small so i got a medium the sleeve length is perfection,1
436,This top is all around great for summer ive worn it to festivals for casual workwear etc love the colors theyre vibrant this top could even be worn on the warmer days of fall with a light jacket over it,1
437,I bought this top in two colorsi think its a really cute easy top to wear but the fabric is extremely thin and poor quality i tucked the front into a pair of shorts and i can already see a small snag forming which im sure will be a hole in no time two stars only because i really do like the look of the top generally i just wish it was something that was going to last beyond a couple of wears,0
438,This is a great dress for me to wear to work lounging on a sunday and everywhere inbetween id even wear it over a bathing suite on a chilly beach highly recommend it,1
439,I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale it is a very nice top im going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants it is roomy so if youre looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top,1
440,After missing out on last years similar dress i am so glad i finally purchased this one it is beautiful in person i bought to wear to a wedding but i am curious if others think it might be too white i bought the peach color i will keep this dress no matter what hope they come out with more next season,1
441,Loved this from the minute i saw it in an email i got the blue grey in a medium im its a little roomy but will be nice over sweaters too i love the cropped length really well made,1
442,The colors in this skirt are gorgeous a super pretty emeraldgreen color with graphic silver and black flowers this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down im loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party the weight of the skirt isnt heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too,1
443,I love this dress the fabric is super soft and it falls beautifully wish it was lined but its a keeper it does run big im always a solid medium and i had to go down to a small for this one but whos complaining the burgundy color is gorgeous im lbs a size m almost always,1
444,Love this top comfy soft and a great length slightly longer in the back and works great with leggings or jeans i love that is has long sleeves i wish it came in more colors,1
445,I am reasonably petite but i like sweaters very oversized and large so i ordered this sweater in a large i was very disappointed when the sweater came because while the sleeves and upper chest area were in large the length of the sweater did not at all increase when the size did because the lower part of the sweater did not increase in size the sweater ended up looking very awkward with the chest and sleeves very large and long but then a very tight and short waistlength stomach i do,0
446,I wanted to love this but my hips interfered it is a little on the short side also as one previous reviewer noted and is definitely made for a straight figure beautiful details on the shoulder and could definitely see this as a staple in my closet if the fit was right sadly it was returned,1
447,Love this top the colors are so fun and happy and the fabricfit are soft and breezy it is definitely on the boxy side but not in an unflattering way in my opinion super cute in my usual size small,1
448,No no noi dont know if it was the way it got flattened out in the packaging or what but it sticks out like a tent from the hips down im about c usually wear a or in dresses this thing barely buttoned over my bust and then flares out to a tentlike triangular shape at the bottom i dont think it would come out by washing and ironing it im afraid it was just cut poorly i looked like a sad prisoner in stripes unfortunately i bought three different dresses in the,0
449,The fit and design quality was grea i love the fact that xxs petite is available online,1
450,Soft and stylish my usual large seems a bit too large so i will try a medium,1
451,Wasnt crazy about this top it looked great online but in person its just a boring and lifeless top,0
452,Runs true to size with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days definitely not meant for winter so dont plan on this for freezing cold days the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit,1
453,Everyone should have this blouse amazing simply love it it does run large so purchase down sizes,1
454,Love love love this pair of underwear yes im writing this about underwear theyre comfortable flattering and no vpl visible panty line without having to wear a thong,1
455,Ugh i was so disappointed with this shirt i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they dont have a straight on photo of the shirt its very plain and lays very unflatteringly its definitely missing something in the front i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadnt returned i,0
456,I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews i could barely get this blouse over my head after getting it on the armholes too are very small the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck i tried the small but think a medium wouldnt have been much better it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair if you have a tiny head and pencil a,0
457,Hi i bought these in both colors the material is very nice for me the only part of the pants that stretched was the waistband sadly i had to return them,1
458,I think this is a really flattering dress i like the length of the sleeves theyre not long like in retailers very first navy photo but all the other pics are accurate in my opinion in my photo im wearing an xs regular so id say its shorter than because im only and its above my knee it may run slightly small because im a aa with a waist hips and usually wear xspetite in retailer but this xs fits me fine although to get it to be fitted at the waist xxs might be bet,1
459,Very soft and lovely tshirt beautiful flowered print and cute detail on neck i am lbs and and got a large,1
460,Bought the tantaupe joggers today in asheville so soft and comfy will probably go back for navy ones i found them true to size will be a great cute addition to my summer wardrobe,1
461,I love this coat it does run a bit large i am pounds and usually wear a petite in most retailer clothes i ordered a small but wish that i would have ordered the xs the length of the jacket is fine but the arms are very long i think that i might have the arm length hemmed but it looks ok rolled up too,1
462,Does not look like the picture lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs,0
463,Comfortable stretchy fabric both colors are beautiful,1
464,This top is girlnextdoor sweet im mad about plaid so it was love at first sight for me i love a blouse with a touch of spandex because i like the fitted look but not tight or loose and spandex gives a bit of a yield size regular fits me well im b waist hips the hem falls at mid hip and the sleeves fall about pass my wrist i plan to wear this top tucked in and the sleeves rolled up since the weather is warmer now the color honey is versatile blue motif has a,1
465,Cute and comfortable not sure id say its worth the full price as its not a very heavy jacket it did suit my needs though and was otherwise what i was looking for so i kept it and have enjoyed wearing it,1
466,Great structure,1
467,I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband but i love them they feel wonderful yet they are so light perfect for warm weather the print takes them from day to night,1
468,I bought this top in a small and it was true to size loved that it wasnt too fitted across the back but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas,1
469,This was a winner retailer bought it with my birthday discount a bit pricey but when i wore it over and over again i can see why the material is so soft flows beautifully and is just the right length on me i am petite slender at and i wear it with wedge heels just like the model i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it againi have received many compliments on this dress bought the washed denim lookthank you,1
470,Fits well super soft and very flattering great for layering and for dressing up or down highly recommend,1
471,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment however i found the band to be extremely small and tight it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin,0
472,Got a ton of compliments great tee with beautiful print,1
473,I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent not even remotely flattering i thought about ordering it in an xs however i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric back it goes,0
474,This top is absolute perfection i dont think the photo does it justice as it looks so much better untucked i dont even have great toned arms but its still so flattering i got the gray one amd might get another color great value as well im petite and bought my usual size small,1
475,I took a chance and tried on this jacket today at the store at first i was worried that it might look boxy on me but as soon as i put it on it was love at first sight its so cute and very comfy the sleeves are slightly long on me but thats been a recurrent issue regarding all my jackets im only about lbs and it fit me very well because its a bit cropped it makes me look taller glad the weather is starting to warm up so i can find more excuses to wear it i didnt need anoth,1
476,I bought this shirt in a size i am a d and it fit perfect but wanted it to fit flowy as it does on the modelso sizing up to a very nice quality fabricnot sure how it will be after its washed looks just like the picture i bought the ivory color,1
477,Great lightweight summer top thats bra friendly i bought the teal color yesterday and wore it today with white skinnies im sometimes a small and sometimes a medium and was fine with the small on this one,1
478,This is a gorgeous lace dress well made true to size a little tight in the neck but not unbearable lovely for any occasion i got this to wear to a fancy wedding it will be my go to dress for fancy occasions,1
479,Im short only ft and this is beautiful and flowy its just below my knees and i think its perfect i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment and asking where i got it its unique and no one else carries one like this i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree i would rather pay for something that i love that has good design and quality instead of or for a so so product thats what i love about retailerpolog,1
480,Fits great and just as pictured the material is very smooth and slinky,1
481,Super soft and super chic this sweater wrap looks great at the mall at church and even just curling up with a hot drink on a cold day at home im still in love with this after a year,1
482,Im pregnant nd trimester and really wanted a beautiful nonmaternity dress i got this in ivory and its just perfect the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable i love the fit and i love the length i got tons of compliments on it my only regret is that i didnt also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get restocked,1
483,I tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom so if youre expecting this one would be great,0
484,I almost never take the time to write reviews but this shirt is amazing its a super soft stretchy substantial fabric that is incredibly flattering it falls perfectly and is insanely comfortable i am lbs and usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops i went with the xs and it is a perfect fit love it so much i bought it in colors i am now completely broke but these shirts will be in constant rotation,1
485,Im on the shorter side of the spectrum and usually wear an xs in retailer this is a lovely suit but it didnt work at all for me it might work well on a taller person or someone who is longer waisted the ruching and fuller cut leg was not flattering on me at all it was very tight and pinched sadly i returned it,0
486,This skirt looked absolutely beautiful in store and took my breath away i immediately headed to the fitting room to try it on but was disappointed by the awkward ruching if this skirt has removed that upper portion and kept a normal waistband thereby also shortening it to knee length it would have been lovely it should be noted that this is midilength which is awkward on me i was unable to find a cute way to wear this which is disappointing since it could have been lovely,0
487,More of a blouse than a tee because of the fabric which has a linen feel to it on the front the back of the top is more of a tee shirt material not a travel top as it would wrinkle the pattern and colors are the same as pictured the sizing is large i ordered an xs my size is usually a small it is a generous fit and boxy not shaped at all the back has a horizontal stitch band about half way down which provides a loose blouson effectthe back which is all black and is tee shirt fabric,1
488,I bought this top for my sisters birthday so the review is based on her opinion she loved it and told me the embroidery was beautiful she said it was tts she also stated that the blouse was so versatile and could be worn dressed up or down,1
489,I loved this dress when i tried it on the plaid is darling and the plunge is sexy i so wish it would work for my body type the waist came a bit too high on me almost a line and it made me look kind of frumpy in the midline,1
490,Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan which i also bought highly recommend,1
491,Definitely size down it does run large however it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works there are small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch it is made well i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter,1
492,Love this skirt length and the detail buttons also great give to the jean fabric looks great on and runs true to size,1
493,I was really hopeful that this top would work on me because it is so cute online however i was very disappointed when i finally received it the sleeves look soft and snuggy in the picture but are actually a bit stiff and scratchy in person i could almost get over the sleeves but the white part of the shirt was horrible i am and a size i wear a size small at retailer and i got a small in this top the bottom of the shirt was a tad short on me and hit just below my belt line which i,0
494,I purchased this shirt in two colors it was a bit longer than i was expecting im curvy lbs dd and the large fit perfectly,1
495,I just received this sweater last week and love it the material is so much softer and lighter than i expected but plenty warm the neck is slightly itchy but not bad at all i wore this sweater to church over a navy dress on sunday and received tons of compliments it is such a unique piece,1
496,This is my favorite top it is gorgeous soft oh so comfortable its not too tight works with leggings jeans or as an overshirt love it,1
497,This is a very chic tunic sweater i absolutely love it fabric is super soft and is a good weight not too thick or heavy which for me is a huge plus as i tend to run hot and usually cant wear sweaters being hot natured the turtleneck was a problem for me so i had my tailor alter it it is still beautiful without the high neck the fabric is quite stretchy and i found it to be tts however it is not as loose on me through the chest as it is on the model i am just over and wear an,1
498,The design is beautiful but it was thick and too warm for a summer event i was planning on wearing it toalso the seam below the chest was uncomfortableneeded to return,0
499,I really wanted to like this jump suit i rarely have problem with retailer clothing im hourglass shape usually wear size this jumpsuit runs small but thats not the only problem top part shirt piece of the jumpsuit is too short so its digging into my lady part the color does not look anything like the picture so overall this piece is failure i hope that i find something similar but fits better,0
500,Besides the beautiful print i found the fit to be extremely flattering im typically a medium but the small was a better fit this dress hangs beautifully and the unusual waist band gives the dress and me a great shape i felt so wonderful wearing this dress,1
501,The blouse is lovely but after washing it exactly as specified it shrank more than a full size this is an expensive handmedown for my daughter,0
502,This dress is beautiful it is just as pretty as it looks in the picture if not prettier it is a great material the colors are beautiful and it is perfect to throw on in the summer i highly recommend it,1
503,In person the colors are prettier and its more interesting than the front shot in the model i tried on and bought my regular medium got home and tried it on and realized its too big,1
504,This lovely cardigan is just that much more special due to the lining on the body and in the pockets they peek out and make the sweater more interesting i wore the black one with a lace dress with cream underlayment and the cream details on the lining worked perfectly to offset the formality of the dress and make the whole outfit casual but chic the sweater washed in the machine and kept its shape when i hung it to dry,1
505,Love love love this mock tank goes fabulous with everything its flows nicely the mock neck looks fantastic you can probably go one size down,1
506,I ordered the dusty pink color and love it works well with many colors and tops i am and lbs with an athletic lean body i do have a butt however and a small waist i vary between a and ordered both because i could see this was a very slim pant i could barely get the up over my hips the fits like a glove with just the right amount of stretch i cant see these pants bagging after wear which is something we all hate love these pants and i know i will wear them often,1
507,Love love lovethis is true retailer from the style to the mix of sweater types and the surprise pleats in back i wore it for the first time yesterday and received compliments all day so glad i bought two colors,1
508,I just bought this pretty dress at my local retailer after finally deciding to go in the store to try it on once i saw it on display in the window in the lilac i already knew i was going to try that one on and take it home though i really love both colors and prints the dress fit me tts sz d and looks absolutely adorable on its super soft light weight but not so much that you dont feel its worth the price and the design reminds me of the retailer i love it has a wonderful vinta,1
509,I cant get enough of this dress this dress is everything from the flattering fit to the colors and pattern to the design and to the quality this dress really has it all this is worth every penny and in my opinion a great price for a versatile high quality dress the material is that super comfy stretchy material which is perfect for everyday it is a no brainer and easy to throw on also the neckline is flattering and sexy without showing anything definitely can wear a normal bra,1
510,I bought this tee in all colors and wish there were more fabulous quality material and style can dress up or down wear with jeans pants or skirts wear alone or layer dont miss out on this addition to your wardrobe,1
511,The pattern is very adorable unfortunately the design is flawed sizing is great at the waist and hip and the length is spot on but the top is wide its strange because i dont think it would fit someone that was bustier than me eitherwill return im considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it,0
512,This is so adorable and flattering dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekendwflats or pumps love this cute dress not all wool so its not itchy at all the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion,1
513,Been searching for a denim trucker jacket since last fall and was happy to see that retailer had this in stock purchased it online without thinking twice typically due to my small upper frame im lbs a for referance im between a size small and an xs bought both and opted for the size small when it arrived i love the fit slightly cropped in the back and i also like how its lined inside great quality and perfect for fall,1
514,Love love love this top its got a little bit of a native american vibe without being overthetop i tend to wear a small in retailer but the medium was the way to go for me its not long and the style errs on the nottight side if you can go between two sizes dont get the smaller one and i love the shade of yellow,1
515,Love everything about this i bought this after reading other reviews beautiful fabric im and bought the small and fits perfect its great with heels or flats seriously just makes you want to twirl dance skip you name it,1
516,I was very happy to snag this dress at such a great price its very easy to slip on and has a very flattering cut and color combo,1
517,I thought these were great everyday shirts for the price i got them on sale over christmas they fit well and i really love the striped shirt the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless,1
518,This cardigansweaterjacket is splendidly soft wonderfully warm and super stylish i wear it with a navy pencil skirt or leggings this piece will be timeless,1
519,This is a bit pricey but its the most beautiful sweater that i own it fits beautifully and the material is soft not itchy which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck the cowl sits beautifully no matter how you fold it and the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright and is just lovely i ordered a small and it covers my butt which is perfect for leggings or even with tights and boots its not shapeless but seems to graze your thighs and has a mild tur,1
520,This dress is a great color fabric and the style is very flattering im wearing to a wedding but it will be great for many events this fall dressy enough for a cocktail party but could also wear to church,1
521,Love this topgreat colors and fits greatreasonably priced,1
522,This dress is really lovely in person the fit was perfect and the length not too short for reference im very busty at f and the dress actually fit im an xl usually and the fit was tts the only thing im not crazy about is the slip its more of a flesh toned color ill probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these retailer,1
523,Look closely and you will be surprised at this awesome print the shirt is very soft and comfy be warned that it runs huge i usually wear a medium or large in this brand after many tries i ended up with a small and it is roomy this looks so cute under a jacket too,1
524,It runs large loose or oversized tops dont bother me so i thought it would be fine but this just made me look wider then i am is thin and too sheer for me as well it was just so unflattering i had to return it,0
525,This dress looked great on the hanger but once on it did absolutely nothing for menavy is one of my most flattering colors but the navy in the dress did not make up for the yucky second color that was so blah it just reminded me of dirt that second color made me look drabi am with a long torso and wear a size in tts tops and dresses but the waist on this dress hit at an uncomfortable spot between by waist and ribs i really needed the waist to be dropped further or higher,0
526,I normally wear in retailer dresses the bottom is roomy but top from band up runs small i bought a and love it i plan to wear it to a wedding,1
527,Bought this shirt online wanted to love it but just couldnt i ordered the xs and it was huge and way too unstructured for my stylejust didnt have enough shape had to send it back,0
528,The top is more of a cream color than an ivory its also a bit boxer than anticipated fit is true to size,0
529,I ordered this after reading the stellar reviews and i was not disappointed i ordered the black and purple floral motif and both are excellent i have a rather big chest dd and the shelf bra and halter support are just enough for me look forward to wearing this on my upcoming vacation,1
530,I ordered these leggings and loved them for about an hour at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant leaving a hole i called customer service and they sent me a nd pair same thing happened i never even pulled on the belt loop they are just so flimsy its a shame bc they are cool looking,0
531,I am pounds a medium is a perfect fit for me i love it not so sheer that i feel that i need to wear a cami underneath sleeves are long and it is so so so soft the scoop neck shows just the right amount without being too revealing i am buying one in every color,1
532,I am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful but i am a medium size around and i chose the ml which is just too big i also found a run in the fabric which is very loose and knitlike in places but i dont care i am exchanging for another one in small,1
533,Love this flowing cute top casual but can be easily dressed up great fit,1
534,This top is great lightweight and flatteringi can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much,1
535,I can never resist a peter pan collar so i bought this top in the ivory its so cute i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments its very comfortable fits well and looks expensive highly recommend it,1
536,I have not had any sort of shedding problem with this jacket i have worn it open with black jeans and a long necklace and buttoned with a scarf and jeans it is really cute i am and lbs and i got the small i wouldnt hesitate especially since it is now on sale,1
537,This is a gorgeous top it is a very soft fabric that drapes beautifully i purchased the red print i tried both on in the store the red really pops ive onlyowed this top for a week and ive received many compliments on it,1
538,As the title suggests i am very skeptical and scared of pencil skirts im slim sz and on the shorter side but i have dramatic hips so ive always had a testy relationship with any clothing that exaggerates them im obsessed with uniquely designed skirts thought so i had to try this and i am so pleased i didthe fit is great and not too tight allows for a little room for ladies with hips i only wish the zipper went down a little further so shimmying out of it were a little,1
539,Love this quirky romper im normally a ml or and took a large in this as the other reviews stated its a bit of a contortion act to get into and out of this but when in it fits well is flattering and oh so cute,1
540,This is a wonderful top it looks great with jeans and shorts feminine and clever design many compliments,1
541,Im so sad this doesnt come in a petite length because the dress is extremely long the fabric and design is beautiful although i do wish the fabric was a bit more flowly,1
542,As soon as i saw this dress i ordered iti didnt want to miss out on it i loved the lookthe colors were so fun and brighti thought it was going to be my perfect dress for an upcoming trip to hawaii i am about i ordered a pxs when it arrived i loved the feel of the fabric and the colors but was wondering what it would look like on as it was a lot of fabric i know it is to be flowing but on me it was just awful part is that the ties on the shoulder are sewn in place so i c,0
543,Unfortunately this was too low cut for meso i had to return it i wish the neckline was higher i could tug it up but it slipped right back down the fabric is a perfect spring weight and the floral pattern is lovely on me the ties no matter how i fiddled didnt cover the cleavage issue and i am a aa,1
544,The dress is true to size but has generous stretch to it i absolutely love this dress i compliments where needed and hides what needs to be hid for me the tummy,1
545,This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design the colors look like sorbet cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring great buy,1
546,Today i happened to walk into my favorite store with an already reduced percent off sale sign i tried on this pants and let me tell youwow they are super comfy and made my behind look great i will definitely start wearing these asap,1
547,I love this dress as a taller longtorsoed woman the sleeves are long enough and the length is perfect the overall fit is also quite flattering but i can imagine it might not be if youre shorterthe material is really lovely and luxuriouslooking for jersey it seems like it should wear wella great worktoevening option as well,1
548,I am so excited about this swimsuit i have never felt so good in a bathing suit its sexy without being too revealing the fit is perfect i absolutely love it,1
549,I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful more matte than shiny perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer,1
550,The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue greycondensation drips from a glass gel deodorant etc i tried the cream but its very sheer i had to return this dress not practical,0
551,Love the cut on these cords as well as the fabric its a somewhat thin corduroy with a nice little stretch which makes them very comfortable and very flattering they are true to size i got the grey which is a pretty light grey without the heavy blue undertone you often get in grey fabricgreat cords,1
552,This dress has the same bold great color as the picture although it has a big swing to it because the upper portion is a bit fitted i dont feel like i look pregnant the material is extremely well done and i like the above the knee styling im very happy i bought it,1
553,Loved the open shoulders but not how large and flowy the rest of it was i could have worn it months preggo,0
554,This top is so darling the different textures are so elegant that you really dont even need to accessorize it has a very flattering cut and a must for any figure,1
555,This dress is so soft and comfortable great winter staple i purchased the blue motif which really doesnt have any blue on it the stripes are fun and make this the perfect dress to throw on and feel great while staying comfortable,1
556,I love everything from retailer but this top did not fit all that flattering the neck line fits a little weird too bad color was nice though i returned the top,0
557,The cut of this piece is great the quality of the fabric is terrible i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length so much that i can no longer even wear it i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces this didnt hold up to one wearing let alone one season i recommend strongly against it,0
558,Very pleasantly surprised by this top its looser but in a flowy not baggy way i ordered the m thevee is just right on me tasteful but just low enough love the sleeve lengthordered thinking another black tee but its going to be well usedand great for evenings,1
559,The top looks better on the model than inperson it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly i dont like the sleeve length or the top style it just didnt look flattering or good i am sending it back looks very boxy,0
560,Bought all colors and each one is unique in its beauty material is thicker than most thin tops today but not too thick for the summer i wear size and the xl fit with room to spare i bought larger in case of shrinkage,1
561,I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black the lace on mine is actually purple at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath but nope pull the netting away and it is purple lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large will return,0
562,I am addicted to retailer and have purchased many many items from them this is definitely one of the best blouses i ever purchased by far i saw this while browsing through the store and love the print and colors and detailing i espeically loved the velvet cutouts that gave this already beautiful sweater something extra i did not purchase this top then because i felt full price was too much and on the hanger it looked like it could be short and boxy when retailer had their black friday sa,1
563,The quality of the shirt is top notch the fabric is lightweight and comfortablenow the consthis top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo definitely not for me,0
564,I love the design of these the laser cut outs are solid and hold up in the wash they are great for workouts and cute enough to wear as leggings out i wore them to my bar method class came home and just changed my top and continued wearing them the rest of the day as a cute outfit they have a great snug fit and the fabric is thick and durable,1
565,I didnt like the price tag but got a good price with a sale so i splurged this skirt hugs curves in the nicest most flattering way without feeling like you have to hold in your belly very cute ruched design and soft make it easily dressed up or down i plan to wear with some bright flats for an upcoming trip but have the perfect white tennies for casual everyday love it,1
566,This dress is so pretty a true cinderella dress thats why i cant find a reasonable explanation for such an amazing dress to be made out of plastic i dont understand much about fabrics but the dress feels like a waterproof camping tent i bought a size which is what i wear in moulinette souers i usually go one size up since i find the rib cage small in this brand the fit was perfect and the cut was very flattering i will anxiously hope for a remake of this dress with a better fabri,0
567,Very soft i sized up was able to wear without a cami underneath,1
568,What a great shirt however none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture the front of them are all a deep blue color no tiedyed effect or whatever youre seeing on the online pics the shirt runs large i am an c and the smaller size was plenty big i cant imagine how the larger size would have looked i think this top will go with many things including as a cover up over dresses,1
569,Soft and comfy without being too thick or too warm flattering cut quality material and construction fully opaque so no showthough true to size im lbs my usual size small is perfect could not improve upon these joggers love love love,1
570,This top is awesome i purchased the gold color in a small fits perfectly and true to size sleeves are nice and long definitely recommend,1
571,This sweater is even better looking in person the body of the sweater is substantial a nice weight the lace is gorgeous i usually wear a size large but found the sleeves really long i purchased a medium and it fits better sleeves are perfect,1
572,Like everyone else i ignored this vest in the store my mom actually gave it to me to try on and practically forced me to buy it it wasnt until i got home that i discovered its versatility i got it in the beginning of june so havent been able to wear it much but fall is quickly approaching and i already have at least ten outfits to wear with it its classy and can dress up any outfit,1
573,Flattering flowy comfortable the back strops have elastic so easy on and off flows when you walk the ties have two different types of black fabric matching knit on one side a matte crepe on the other love the pockets very versatile piece,1
574,I tried these on in the store and instantly fell in love with them they have an elastic waist which for my shape pear can sometimes be bad but these pants dont cut me off or accentuate the fluffy parts but lay nice over my belly and legs in a flattering way they do have a slit that goes the whole way up the leg that the picture doesnt show but the underneath piece of fabric wraps around your legs so i think it would be hard to show too much i bought a medium and they hit lower on,1
575,This shirt is amazing the soft fabric detailed embroidery and gorgeous little beadssequinsall fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price i love the length and cut of this too not boxy yet not too tight or fitted just covers my bum can be dressed up or down,1
576,I love this dress the pattern is unusual along with the mesh cutouts im a sucker for mesh cutouts it does look a little bit like a maternity dress but eh who cares let them think what they want i recently wore it to a casual outdoor wedding and received many compliments i knocked off one star for quality because the back of the dress where the zipper stops needed to be reinforced by hand to keep it from ripping this is a common problem i have with retailer dresses and no im not trying,1
577,Love these jeans wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point as is the wash the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels a definite buy,1
578,Ordered the pink in a small but it ran bigthe xs was perfect for my medium frame it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture looks great with chinos or jeans might need to get the other color,1
579,I loved the look of this dress the moment i saw it but was ridiculously long at i can usually get away with buying regular length longer dresses and pants with the help of heels if needed but not a chance this time this dress does not come in petite and the fringed bottom design of the dress would not allow for any type of altering either,1
580,I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes it runs big so size down at least sizes i didnt realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat that part of the coat is really nice and comfy unfortunately the rest of the coat the wool part is very itchy it wouldve been awesome if it was lined on the inside but its notso im taking them back,0
581,The back of this dress is stunning i am usually a petite but could get away with regular tried on xs lbs dd chest and it was good length and not too low cut colors are really fun the mango one has a tiny bit of sparkle in one of the lines flory and airy,1
582,I have been looking for a vest this winter and i saw this one online i am a huge fan of swing tops i dont care for super fitted clothes the knit says part wool so i was expecting it to be a little scratchier however when i got it it is so soft and more cotteny feel to it than wool but has the warmth of wool when wearing it i really have to try not to wear it everyday just love this vest its my favorite purchase this season i am a size in tops and i can either do a med or a large i,1
583,Love this dress light and breezy but im wearing it with tights and a jacket for a winter look,1
584,I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style it fit great the first time i wore it i washed it once according to the care instructions after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry it was basically ruined it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches im pretty bummed about it because it was cute,0
585,Quality jumpsuit but poor design the green made me look a bit like gumby the cartoon character,0
586,This is the widest sweater i have ever seen i laughed out loud when i opened it and then showed it around my office and everyone else cracked up too it is comically wide even when i was months pregnant the ml would have been pretty roomy on me now that im back to about a size this looks like jared from subways preweightloss pants in sweater form ridiculous,0
587,Stylish great color great fir in between weathermay need shortening but constructed in a way that will make it easy,1
588,I saw a lady trying this on in the store and fell in love with sweater picture does not do it justice there is so much detail my usual size is small and it fit perfect well worth price,1
589,Love these jeans,1
590,I love the pilcro line and these leggings yes definitely more a legging than jean did not disappoint however i did think the material would have a little more substance and weight they are pricey so i am hoping that the thinness of the material will not prevent them from holding up well,1
591,I wound up returning this shirt because i ordered the wrong size so sad i should have sized down im tall and long waisted but slight on top the shirt is gorgeous and the detailing is perfectly done id definitely recommend trying this one just choose your size carefully,1
592,Love this topthe material is very soft and though this isnt a thick tshirt it holds its shape and supports the grommet detailing nicely im about not busty and got a smallfits great the color is more of an offroseblush has more of a brown tint than the photo shows,1
593,I absolutely loved this top it fit great and was easy to dress up or down i wore it once and washed it according to the tag cold water and flat dry it is now sizes too small and unwearable extremely disgusted,0
594,I have never written a review on retailer before but after seeing this top in the store and then seeing how it is depicted online i felt i had a duty to review it it is gorgeous i saw it in the store and tried it on with my mom and we both had a fit over it the fabric is light pink with a shimmer the flower detailing is so feminine and soft the backs closure is just another piece of the beautiful detailing i left the store and thought i would think about it only because i was trying to be,1
595,I ordered this since it looked so cute on the model when i it arrived i was excited to try it on but when i didblah the color is murky and the top runs large not to mention that the material is too heavy for a short sleeved top plus its lined i really wanted to like it and debated wetting it and then putting it in the dryer to shrink it a bit in the end i decided that it wasnt worth it too bad as the concept was a good one it just failed in the execution,0
596,This dress runs very large i am and lbs hourglass curvy build i ordered a size small and its enormous on me the description says fitted but it is not fitted at all its like a big wool sack id have to gain lbs for this dress to come close to fitting im very sad that the fit is so far off and the dress is now all sold out in all smaller sizes including petite i never normally buy petite clothes but i think i would have to get a petite xs if it were available the dress lo,0
597,I was looking for a cute going out top that was ageappropriate yo i read other reviews that it ran large so i got xxs regular xs not available for reference i am and pounds but semibroad in the shouldersi was wary of the poly fabric but it is surprisngly nice and drapes well easy care for sure doesnt look cheap at all when worn on the shoulders the elastic is tightish but maybe i could have gone to xs if they had it but at least i know the xxs wont fallslide i,1
598,I love this shirt so much that ive now bought it in colors the olive green and the red probably would have bought it in black too if i didnt already have enough black shirts its both a plain and simple tee but with the fun laceup detail at the neckline that keeps it from being boringit runs true to size but is very fitted however due to the thickness of the material i didnt feel like any unflattering bumps or lumps were being highlighted despite how close the shirt fit to my,1
599,Looks great on the model but in actuality there is way too much fabric what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent or a maternity top on a petite woman it didnt matter which size they all fit me disastrously i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in but theres too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cutalteration on the side seams sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns and if they pin the shirts back on the models if you put a,0
600,Bought these in p and im normally p in most pants for reference im and lbs and the fit perfect got many compliments on these pants,1
601,When i first saw this i thought it was a bit boxy but i was drawn to the colors the armholes are a little large and i got an xs normally wear a size so i will probably wear a tank underneath but overall the fit is relaxed and comfortable i love the colors it has a little longer length im i see this being cute with white jeans blue jeans love it,1
602,This is a great top going into the fall season it runs a little large i went down one size and it fits perfect,1
603,Got this in the dark blue wash there is significantly less color variation than pictured online its a medium wash and incredibly soft i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes go with your larger sizethis feels incredibly silky its lightweight so it can be worn almost yearround and will layer well over say a tissuestyle turtleneck in the winter its longer in the b,1
604,I got the ivory its very cute under the split back cloth stone button down denim in slightly oversized top i wear sm but bought the med in the denim button down this top in ivory runs true to size but the dark colors in sm fit like a medium the top snags easily it s pricey but i love it,1
605,I had a hard time deciding to order red or turquoise as both colors are really nice in person the black of course is a classic another reviewer found the top to be small but i found it to be a little big on me in my usual size not too bad but a little bigger than expectedteh neck part is effortless as there is stiching to help the colw effect stay in place the fabric is thin though so may show things thinking bra ripples and perhaps some other ripples in front tummmy keeping it,1
606,This is a really great top it looks fantastic on while it is a bigger fit its so flattering i get tons of compliments every time i wear it,1
607,Very soft and luxe materials and really well made pockets a nice detail and otherwise a great cut and length petticoat underneath a cool detail too,1
608,This top is flowy fluid and comfortable the material is like a stretchy crepe its thin but not sheer well i bought the bright red maybe white is sheer oh speaking of bright red well it is i mean it is the most vibrant red the photo online at least on my screen doesnt really do the red justice at allthe fit is true to size the nice thing about this top is that it has movement and yet it isnt full of fabric and look like a maternity top and the armholes are not big th,1
609,Got this for work my style is casual to boho and it turned out to be my goto cardiganthe color is soft and pretty it drapes perfectly got the xsmalland it fits beautifully plus the weight of the knit is just right forchilly evenings would love to have it in more colors,1
610,Extreme comfort for travel and out door activities,1
611,Love this swimsuit runs true to size definitely recommend very flattering for reference i have a straightathletic build im c and size was great for top and bottom,1
612,Found this little surprise in store yesterday where thankfully one of my atlanta stores carries petites the materials is wonderful feels like cashmere i got the rust which will be an anytimeanywhere piece recommend highly,1
613,Most beautiful dress i have ever seen or tried on i read all of the reviews and it seemed ladies with hips stated the dress ran small so after over a year of watching this dress and waiting for it to go on sale i order a size bigger than i normally wear i was devastated that it was too large all sizes except and were sold out so now i am stuck returning my dress or paying a small fortune to have it altered,1
614,This is such a flattering easy to wear dress i am a size with a g bust and this dress fits me perfectly so if youre busty this should work for you too soft flowy feminine looking forward to warm weather,1

617,I ordered this in an p yellow the yellow is more of a rich golden yellow than the easter yellow i see on my monitor that i was hoping itd be but im keeping it because it fits me perfectly i am chesty for my size ddd and somehow i dont look bigger than i am in this top i also have broad shoulders and this doesnt feel tight when i move my arms bonus that it has loops to keep your bra straps in place i have to dock a star though because there are quite a few fabric threads to trim f,1
618,This dress is a new favorite the cut is great for most figures and the fabric has a nice drape around the curves of the body so it sort of has a slimming effect which i love im petite and curvy and so the hem lands closer to top of my knees than it does on the model in the image the color in person is slightly more purple and less brownmaroon but it still works for a fallwinter wardrobe if you are uneasy about the colors i recommend looking at it in store before purchasing i love thi,1
619,The picture online doesnt do this pretty dress justice im curvy and always searching for dresses that dont make me look like a sack of potatoes its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape and the print is much more vibrant in person will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out,1
620,I never would have given these pants a second look online in person they are much cuter the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend this brand has always run small for me i am about lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer,1
621,Ive never bought a jumpsuit and loved this online so i took the chance and ordered it im and lbs i bought the small and it fits great i love the plastic around the neckline to keep the top in place the draping fabric on the chest is great for my small chest gives the look of a fuller chest absolutely love this great buy and a great price,1
622,George venson of vousta has designed a pair of pajama bottoms that are beautifully designed comfy to lounge sleep in they are a light weight flannel that fit true to size wash extremely well the design on these pjs are like no other a white background with red birds polar bears deer all with tree branches running through the length of the pant theyre just delightful you must try them,1

625,This does run a little large but its light and flattering for me the material is a very lightthin chambray but its also lined,1
626,I am partial to maeve tops i love the prints i loved the ski print as soon as i spotted it i think its such a darling shirt for winter the material is light weight which is perfect for layering im planning on wearing it with my fur vest as well as a knit vest i got at retailer last summer i got a i go between and because i prefer some room in button down shirts and it fits as planned i wanted to wait for it to go on sale but i was worried about selling out so i picked up on black f,1
627,These jeans are worth every penny they fit me perfectly as soon as i put them on and i wore them the rest of the day they are true to size with very generous stretchif anything i would size down they feel durable but not like typical denim very soft i am and about or so and my normal fit like a dream i did end up exchanging these because there was a small nick on the inside of the left thigh and i was afraid they might tear right open if the new pair comes without defe,1
628,Love this skirt because of the colors the unique style and for a knit skirt im very impressed that it maintains shape throughout the day great skirt to own received several compliments had to size up from a to a waist and hips the size fit snugly and not very appropriate for work but great for a night out the size is still form fitting flattering and work appropriate very comfortable going up a size without compromising the form fit,1
629,I love this top it is comfortable and different from other tops in my closet,1
630,Give me a dress with pockets any day i loved how i can wear this fall spring so cute so comfortable can dress it up or down have events that im going to wear it too,1
631,This dress was built for my body to disguise its flaws i did have to size up because i am broad shouldered busty with a tummy pooch and no hips this dress skims along all that mess and makes me look slimmer received the package today and am wearing it right now im so happy i ordered size my stats are dd,1
632,As soon as i put the dress on i had to buy it i felt like it looked and fit really well on the dress pictured is an and was a bit baggy up top im a c so i purchased a and it fits like a glove im and it hits just above the knee,1
633,Wellmade gorgeous bra the red is more wine in person which is great this bra runs quite smallgo up at least band and cup size i got a c and it fits great im a b across brands like vs etc youll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing youre wearing something this sexy,1
634,I wanted to love this blouse so much but try as i might it just fit so oddly on me im usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown first the color was more graybrown but it was still ok but second the fit was off maybe i just got a bad one but the center of the blouse was so offset that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the vneck was so low that you could see my bra there was no adjusting i could do to fix it the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an,0
635,Thisan unexpected purchasei found this on my way to the dressing roomthe fit is stunning i sized way down ie normally wear curvy and bought a smallit accentuates my curves and is incredibly flattering i bought the navy and will be adding another color soonthe material is viscose blend soft and flowy its a nice addition to my work wardrobe,1
636,I purchased this sweater in my usual xs but found the silhouette to be way more tentlike than pictured on the model the knit is pretty stiff too so the sweater didnt lay flat but hung on me in kind of a triangle shape also the sweater knit was heavier than i expected from the picture and seemed to be more of a fall weight piece i am fairly small but lately im finding that retailer pieces are huge in an xs and i have to size down to xxs i know im not that tiny maybe this wou,0
637,Beautiful did not look like much on the hanger but this is a beauty give it a tryi am normally a size and the small fits perfectly it should be loose fitting with a dropped not so obvious flounce the colors are subtle and it will go nicely with many lightweight summer pants and shorts,1
638,The pictures do not do this blouse justice the pleat in the front is so flattering that i did a double take this detail doesnt come through the images which is a shame as it is the most beautiful element of this blouse the collar that stands up just enough is something unexpected and the sleeve length is fun yet sophisticated i am madly in love with this blouse and highly recommend it to anyone it is extremely seethroughso unless you want to show off your nips you should expect,1
639,Really cute topespecially the back ive tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric regular length works fine on my petite frame as well the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it first one i received had a snaghole in the lower sleeve so hopefully it holds up,1
640,This top is cute love the ruffle sleeves the store i got these had both colors so ended getting both colors because the top is cute does run a little large i ended up going a size down,1
641,Like all maeve tops of this nature i am absolutely in love maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top this top looks great with jeans shorts skirts etc i purchased it in all colors the blue is more of a robins egg blue the orange is a great tangerine color perfect for us tennessee fans and the ivory is a wonderful brownishwhite the ivory is my favorite because its a very unique color i have a ton of white and ivory tops but i do not have one in a color like this,1
642,Fits perfect,1
643,I love this dress its super comfortablesoft fabric and doesnt bind anywhereyet somehow its still feminine and sexy i get compliments on it wherever i go also it works all yearround in winter it can be easily paired with boots tights a longsleeved black tshirt etc,1
644,After reading reviews i ordered a medium instead of a large even though i am typically a size it was definitely the right decision a very flattering dress in a beautiful color if you order in the right size it is not at all dowdy it is forgiving in the belly area which is great for me it can be worn with tights or without tights so really quite versatile i am sure that i will wear it a lot also it is very comfortable,1
645,I snagged this top with the off sale and its adorable i got the white and it goes great with some skinny jeans or tucked into a skirt i found it ran true to size my only complaint is that like some other reviewers have stated it does wrinkly very easily and i would say for full price i dont think the quality is worth the cost but on sale its a great shirt,1
646,I love the great variety of fabrics and textures used in these joggers you will also,1
647,I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love im a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips this dress made me look and feel slimmer and is light to wear the dress is a perfect length too im and this dress hits me right at the ankles if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual this one is perfect,1
648,This top is super soft cotton with raw edges on the sleeves and hem i bought the green top which is a medium faded olive color despite the picture this top is shortish in the front and on the sides which are slit the top is also very very boxy its wide across and doesnt fit the body at all the sleeves are a slimmer fit which contrasts nicely with the wide body the picture is very deceptive that said this top is perfect for early fall late summer super comfy floaty i wear,1
649,I love these jeans they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones they look great paired with a vneck and flats or cute blouses and heels a great buy like another reviewer i too found these ran a little small and went up a size,1
650,Soft comfy and cute great for casual wear shouldve bought in more colors,1
651,I saw this dress online and i thought it was perfectly cute however once i tried it on at home it just didnt work one of the buttons broke in half as i tried unbuttoning and once i got it on the dress was so small that the cuffs cut off circulation to my forearm im and lbs and purchased in size i didnt even try buttoning all the way i took it back and i dont even think i want a larger size the buttons are just too fragile,0
652,I love these jeans so much i have pairs i bought pink and gray last year and then black and denim this year i am lbs with a slim straight athletic build these jeans look amazing on they dont have those funny crease rolls in the legs because the legs werent cut right i dont have to tug on the waist to get them to stay up and they are just very flattering on sometimes when i try on skinny jeans they fit funny around the waistband and make my hips look weird not these i ju,1
653,Just grabbed this today great find i paired it with a white blouse with blue polka dotswill pair with anything though with great neutral colors white or blue jean jackets sweatersthe skirt has a little stretch for my hourglass figure but would work with any type body i think a many season skirt perfect for traveling,1
654,I do not think this dress runs large i think it it is true to size i am usually a size and a dd definitely curvy and tall at the large was perfect for my bust i ordered a med also and it looks really narrow in the waist length is below knees as pictured i was finding that the zipper under left arm is very catchy i even checked the med and it is worse that concerns me but love the dress so i am keeping the large length is so hard i hardly ever find a dress the hits a little,1
655,I saw this top online and fell in love with it as i live in white cotton comfy tanks but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy d and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror believe me this,1
656,Gorgeous skirt received so many compliments the colors are perfect to match with many topsjacketssweatersas well as different shoesboots bringing out the colors i unfortunately ordered a large thinking it ran small and the large is too big in the waist so i will try to have it tailored i like my skirts fuller in the hip area i hope retailer offers more of this type of item just adore it for size i am a in bottoms but since the skirt looked slim with out lining i ordered a large,1
657,Every year around this time our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat ive seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves this coat is a dream not too thin and not too thickits the perfect layering piece the fabric has perfect stretch in it the colors are lovely i ended up with the cream color but i loved the green too in many sweater coats i prefer an xl but because of the stretch the l was just perfect im and it hits wel,1
658,I thought these pants were cute when i put them on they fit perfectly and were comfortable however i wore them for about minutes and they were a completely different size and looked awful,0
659,Just as nice and comfortable except this one ahs the bonus of being able to pair wit different topstoo bad i ahve the dress in the same colorsoft stretchy stays in place lining dindt crwal up when walked but dindt try the petitefit true to size if you usually need petites you will otherwise it fals in an awkwards pot on your calvesmy usual xs was comfrtable and flattering not clingy i would get it if i dindt have hte dress plus of dress is i dont have to thi,1
660,I own quite a few pieces from retailerplogie but this one is my favorite by far the color is a crispy white the length is just right and has a beautiful flow to it it is more fitted on top but flares out for a feminine appeal i am lbs i bought the regular xs and it fit like a nice tunic top perfect for a curvy figure i wore it with my tight jeans and boots got compliments from everyone,1
661,I love this poncho i would wear it to the beach or even for fun outing like wine tasting,1
662,Versatile and flattering i dont order many clothes online because im a tough fit and need to try on first but this was one of the rare times it was worth the risk i love the high waisted vintage style and the length is perfect the bold color is fun the little details are even better navy blue piping the buttons and the ribbon laced on the back great skirt,1
663,I love this dress i wore it to my friends bridal shower and got so many compliments i cant wait to wear it again,1
664,I saw this instore tried it on and was sold it is not just super soft but very flattering on i am petite lbs and bought the xs in black the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans,1
665,I love this dress this is perfect for ladies with curves it does run a little large and i felt i could have worn both the small and the medium i bought medium because it accentuated my curves without being too revealing i bought the dark green which is a beautiful color and not see through at allalthough i can guess the white might show a little but the white was not available in my store this will be so perfect for the cold weather,1
666,These leggings are very comfortable with a bit of control i ordered the m and they fit perfectly as usual i do have to tuck the hem up just a bit but i have to do that with all my leggings i love the laser cut detail on the side which is a lavender color,1
667,Wearing this dress for the first time now and i love it soft material comfortable and easy to dress up or dress down making it good for all kinds of different occasionsi was a bit nervous about the initial purchase due to other reviews saying this dress isnt great for pear shapes but i wholeheartedly disagree i think it actually just needs a belt for those of us with particularly curvy figures im wearing a belt around my natural waist and have bloused out the top and it looks g,1
668,Adore the rust color in this top very pretty rust color would go with a lot of stuff my only small pet peeve with the shirt is the opening under the hook and eye i have been wearing a seamless tank underneath but everything else about the blouse fits so perfect drapes nicely that i think the opening is a minor thing that a tank top can fix beautiful on felt that it fit tts im usually a b got an xs in this top,1
669,I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size i would definitely recommend this purchase,1
670,These pants are perfect they are amazingly comfortable and soft i could wear them all the time im and have been looking for shorter jeans to wear with ankle booties which has been pretty tough i ordered petite and the description said the inseam would be i dont know if thats true since they fall right at my ankle and usually thats around a inseam but definitely a great length and i dont need to hem the leg opening isnt too big so i can roll it upcuff them to get,1
671,I tried on this romper when it was still full price and loved it but wasnt sure i wanted to splurge at the time at the new sale price this romper is definitely worth it for the quality and style i am lbs and the xs fits pretty well but truthfully an xxs would have been better if it existed the top part of the romper above the waist is a bit long the waistband hits maybe an inch or below my natural waist but perhaps this can be tailored overall very happy with this purchas,1
672,Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item however the item came with unrepairable holes not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap didnt even try it on so sad but i still love retailer,0
673,Wow im really glad i didnt listen to the negative reviews in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops the neck line i agree does need to be secured i wish they would have added a snap its fine though as i dont mind sewing it closed this top is worth it im lbs and small chested so for slim girls i think this is perfect,1
674,This dress is the absolute best it is comfy flattering cute pretty much the best dress ever as a previous reviewer said ti is a even season dress throw it on with boots and a wool cardi in the winter and youre all set i didnt even think twice about buying it perfect length a little longer in the back but not too short in the front and i do not like short dressesskirts dont think about it just buy,1
675,I tried this dress in store and was in love immediately i had to special order a petite size but fits wonderfully for me ran a little large im and and ended up with a petite xxs and it fits great,1
676,I love this dress i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits i would highly recommend this dress too cute,1
677,I tried this on in the store and it was huge i couldnt try on a smaller size because they only had a and i tried on my usual size i dont think the embroidery is as pretty in person either definitely not worth the price,0
678,This top is very pretty i ordered both xs p and xxs p not knowing someone wrote the word boxy in the review i tried on the xxs p first and that was fine did the trick to not look too boxy teh fabric is stretchy and softcomfortable not scratchy lace the lining is soft as well color is ivory and the embroidery is nice and fiery colors the sleeves are fairly flattering even on bigger arms arm hole was just right too never know with fluttery sleeves for reference i am lbs,1
679,I love this tank super soft and comfy i wear with leggings jeans shorts anything longer in the back so will cover your butt at least it covered mine runs slightly oversized love the asymmetry in the front very flattering very happy with it,1

682,Omg where have you been all my life this tshirt is the bestnot seethrough perfect length perfect vneck no cami required amazing colors perfect shape not tight body skimming doesnt poof out or look weird on larger busts and goes with everything from jeans to dress pants i want every color but for now i ordered the moss and blue which goes perfectly with my fair skin and long silver hair oh and did i mention the sleeves are perfect to wear with or without a cardigan no slee,1
683,I saw this online and went to the store to try it on so glad i did it did not work on me at all it is so wide just did not look right it was also not flattering at the neckline either i thought it was beautiful until i had it on too bad wanted to love it,0
684,I am so glad i ended up with these pants wasnt ready to pay full price but ordered them immediately on sale realized they were definitely worth every penny of full price they are so soft have so much detail these pants are just gorgeous im and cant wait to wear these to cabo they may run a little large,1
685,I purchased both the coral and cream the coral is more rustic than vibrant and to me more orange than a true coral but for summer is probably super cute i found this ran large for reference i am lbs and purchased a small my usual size in retailer i kept the small in the cream but if i were to keep the coral i would have sized down to xs you can adjust a little but the arms were loose and coral didnt look as good if not fitted super cute with jeans and a tee with yoga pants,1
686,I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress im pounds so i shouldve known better and gotten a petite style dress however i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger d i figured they would help fill it out upon receiving the dress i was first shocked that for the price the construction was pretty poor quality there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn when i put it on it was clear that th,0
687,Love love love this dress i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket i found it true to size my normal size fits me well buy this dress you wont regret it,1
688,I loved this dress it runs small im normally a so i had to get a in the fitting room the zippers got stuck a lot i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding my fiance and i tried in vain for minutes to try to zip it up and then it broke the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go it was awful i co,0
689,This had a cute design but an unflattering fit for me it was boxy and made my boobs look droopy,0
690,This skirt is going to be perfect for the hot texas summers super lightweight and floaty and the pattern is so gorgeous will go great with my favorite purple shoes,1
691,I ordered the white in this i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos i dont think they do this piece justice i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered i found it fit true to size love the three ties in the back its a tad baggy but looks great i can see that this might snag easily though,1
692,Love this hoodie i bought a large to fit bigger on me and it works well love the color and embroidery,1
693,I hesitated to order this for a long time but am glad i did i was concerned that it would have trouble staying on the shoulders and would be unflattering to my large chest f however it is surprisingly comfortable and secure has some kind of rubbery grips on the shoulders that keep it in place very welldesigned and actually supportive to the chest it offers the sunprotection i am looking for i am also very pale and tired of getting odd burns on my stomach and chest and as i head,1
694,I tried on these pants and was instantly in love they are very flattering and stylish but also incredibly comfortable i am and the length is perfect to wear with heels i highly recommend these,1
695,Nice top that can be worn alone or underneath a sweater can be dressed up or down and worn in all seasons,1
696,I ordered this dress on a whim because of the off on mothers day weekend and i am so glad i did this dress is very flattering i have a hard time finding dresses that are a little loose but dont make me look fat this dress has just the right cut i recommend it for anyone who likes something not to tight but also flattering,1
697,Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down will need to send back due to on line only i am hoping one size smaller does the trick,1
698,This skirt is very pretty but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized so theres very little stretch for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements theres no way to get this skirt on past the hips,0
699,The fabric and its texture didnt meet my expectations unfortunately there were too much fray and castoff of edge yarns of a fabric however this will fit if you wear over the swimming wears,0
700,I have been looking for the perfect jumpsuit and this is it i am and lbs and the small is a perfect fit the fabric is super comfy you can wear a regular bra yay and it can be dressed up or down i am looking forward to taking this on my european vacation in august the blue is a very pretty blue but i opted for the black,1
701,This product is amazing i love that its comfortable and stylish at the same time i love the unique color pattern and the length of this product i also love that i can wear to any occasion and can dress it up or dress it down its very versatile and i love it,1
702,Great quality beautiful print definitely a steal given its current sale price it does run large order a size smaller works perfect with a belt,1
703,Love this top i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it great quality fabric comfortable and can be dressed up or down,1
704,Its hard to find a sweater that is warm and cozy but doesnt look bulky this sweater does it all it is delicate looking and soft and flattering it is also surprisingly warm i wear it with jeans for everyday but it looks good enough to wear out to dinner or such i bought the periwinkle which was the most flattering on me blond and fair i am hoping to get the green too when they go on sale i said it runs a little small because i took a small instead of my usual extra small in sweaters,1
705,This picture doesnt do the skirt justice i paired it with a creme colored cashmere cowlneck sweater and a silver jeweled belt it is really pretty and flattering on,1
706,I am a short frame with broad shoulders and a large chest which means peplum tops typically look horribly unflattering on my frame not this top the cut is very flattering due to the lower peplum not too much fabric to add to the waistline truly a perfect fit if this top came in any other colors i would buy them all,1
707,This top looks pretty much like it does not the model the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight the fabric is light weight but not seethrough it does not wrinkle a lot ive gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too the vneck is pretty deep but doesnt show so much cleavage that you couldnt wear it to work,1
708,Ive got a bit of a lovehate relationship with this top the fabric feels a little odd and wrinkles crazy hard and im not a fan of the open ladder ribbon over the bust really who needs to see the top of my bra but i love love love the overall fit the details like the polka dot trim and the sheer tucks and the color blue green it looks good tucked in or loose and i can layer it under cardigans and jackets ill get a matching ribbon and sew it in under the ladder ribbon so its act,1
709,Bought this for my daughter in college for her birthday i heard shouts of this being her new goto topher roomies have already tried to borrow it super comfy with a beautiful offtheshoulder styleno one can go wrong with this,1
710,This dress is perfect i just bought it yesterday in store for a wedding im going to next spring i got it in red which is normally not a great color for me but its a darker red so it works i love anything with cutouts so i was drawn to it immediately i normally wear a in a dress to accommodate my rather wide shoulders and the fit well i can see it working for a variety of occasions one big plus is the qualitythis isnt even remotely flimsy,1
711,Love this top but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me hoping theres a sz sm in stock,0
712,These jeans were so cute on wore them a handful of times and theyd been washed twice put them on and rip ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear poor quality disappointing and not what i expected from retailer they also run large even for a more relaxed fit sized down for a good fit,0
713,I recently purchased this dress and am so happy with it the gathered area over the bust is visually interesting and isnt too revealing the jersey material hangs beautifully i also appreciate it being lined,1
714,I was so excited to see these pants on sale they fit beautifully and drape well the hidden lining of shorts is a great feature and i will get seasons of use from thesenow if i could only get them in plain black too,1
715,This dress is made very well and can be dressed up or down it can be worn with open toe wedges in spring and summer and cute booties in the fall,1
716,As stated in my review title theyre amazing theyre incredibly well made have just the right amount of stretch and are so flattering i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings they can definitively be worn to work or at least where i work where the dress code is business casual my only issue is the length which being at isnt surprising theyre about inches too long im a size and got the large i couldnt recommend these enough,1
717,Nice quality fabric and design but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange wanted to love it but sadly sent it back,0
718,I wanted to love this as i love bright colored patterns however when i received the pattern was different than the one pictured and didnt appear as bright and the material was much different than i expected could almost see through the shirt where it is white and is very thinalso i have a larger chest and a smaller waistline and the cut of the where the peplum began made me look larger than i actually am i am a ddd and i normally where a size medium a medium fit but like i said made,0
719,I have too many grey cardigans i also have a lot of oversized cardis but i had to have this one because the stitch pattern is so nice and the yarns are so soft and snuggly how could i resist the weave is a bit open work but it still keeps me warm happy it also lays in a way that doesnt make me look bulky and top heavy which my body type already is i feel sorry for the first reviewer who kept getting subpar sweaters mine arrived brand new in factory cellophane i would advise that this,1
720,Love this dress going to wear it for thanksgiving love the material,1
721,I give this sweater a five star review i am always thrilled to be able to add a cardigan or caccoon sweater that is a color that is different than black or whitethis pairs beautifully with so many of the shells and sleeveless shirts that i have from retaileryes this sweater is extremely delicate it didnt pull at all while i was trying it on this will be a great transition sweater,1
722,Sizing is just getting unreasonable and nothing fits unless its a crew neck nowadays this vneckline would have been perfect if pictured as on the model but on my lb frame the xxs petite neckline came down so low my bra was exposed along the eyelet trim additionally the shirt looked like it shrunk in length and wouldnt have covered a belt on my pants it also did not match the product description and measured from the hps to hem im unsure of how when pattern grading an i,0
723,This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress its pretty bad when it wont even zip up on the hanger such a beautiful dress it broke my heart,0
724,Im only so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear size end and bust dd the small gave me plenty of room in the top the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i dont feel over exposed or anything the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet the long sleeve design is also awesome i have gotten numerous compliments on it the top has an inner liner,1
725,So comfortable i wore it during my last airline travel day and a complete stranger complimented me on it,1
726,These sold out in my size before i even knew they existed probably a great indication that your inbetween and plussize customers are hungry for more options from you please restock so i can get in on this apparentlyperfect pant,1
727,I absolutely love this dress it hugs your body without being clingy very flattering the fabric is so soft i am lbs and i usually take an xs or s i got a m in this dress because of the style and fit and it was perfect,1
728,This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress the fabric is soft and flowy and everything a swing dress should be i was concerned that it would be too short but its the perfect lengthfun while still being classy a nice chunky eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully highly recommend,1
729,I do not think i could express how much i love this top it is so flattering and soft i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top it is stretchy which for me is a wonderful thing i purchased the day it came in store it is quickly prone to pilling though with the style of shirt its not so bad but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost,1
730,A serious joke i struggled with the buttons for a good minutes and gave up after the rd button im not sure what they were thinking,0
731,This dress is much prettier in person colors are more vibrant and dont need to iron the neckline was too low for me so wore a light purple cami underneath which matched the purplish shade of the dress perfect,1
732,They look nice on the page but they didnt work on my body made me look big and boxy maybe if youre superskinny theyll be fine,0
733,Love this sweater i wore it to work with leggings and a long sleeved shirt underneath it lays nicely,1
734,Beautiful and femine dress it comes with a slip which is a big plus it fits well and the sleeves are flowy and just at the right length the only downside is that the bottom is not hem and being lace it is delicate you have to take care wearing this,1
735,I love this blouse it is perfect for a curvy figure i think it runs true to size maybe size up if you have a larger chest i love how it is so feminine yet structured the fabric is lovely soft and structured all at once love the knot i tried it with the stevie ankle jean and couldnt leave the store without it it is pricey but sometimes its okay to pay for a perfect fit,1
736,Beautiful dress stretch material makes sure it fits the figure nicely great value,1
737,These jeans look amazing on im and an hourglass figure and these fit perfectly if you like high waisted jeans these are for you a small heal does need to be worn but i wouldnt say they are excessively long,1
738,I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile when it arrived the pleat in front shown in the center was far to the right so the overall look was crooked not sure if it was a quality control issue or if thats the true design but it will have to go back too bad because i had high hopes,0
739,The lace on this looks like it would be stiff but it isnt its soft and drapes nicely i normally buy an xl if its not a knit and so i did the top will fit up to a size in the xl because it is boxy and generous it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body it looks looser in the photoits as see through as the photo and i wouldnt wear a cami under it that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho i think a nude bra works just fine you can see the model is wearing a white bra,1
740,My store got this great tunic in white and i loved it so much perfect tunic length swingy detailedbut as soon as i saw the orange option i knew i had to wait for it i just got it and im in love the orange print is so lovely the perfect fall color and the print is timeless the fabric is light and easy the fit is definitely bigger but i usually wear a l or xl in retailer tops and i preferred the xl i have a lot of curves so i love a top that has some room but i needed the xl for room i,1
741,This is a beautiful vest i love the colorblocking the modern and structured style and its versatility i bought it with a defective item discount because there were some stains i promptly took it to the dry cleaners and was informed that the black would bleed onto the white paneling if they did a full wash they spotcleaned it and it did bleed although the tag says to dry clean this baby the black dye will bleed to the white fabric ill be taking it back into the store today for a ref,0
742,I like this sweater very much its short but not too short and soft but not fluffy the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors i ordered the tan are great for me a redhead im lbs and dont like clingy tops so i took a m and its perfect really cutewith jeans,1
743,Got this in the bluefloral and absolutely love it,1
744,I ordered a xxs petite based on previous reviews but it was too short and snug in the shoulders i then tried on the regular xs and it fit nicey loose but it is the style shoulders fit i usually need xs petite so kind of true to size to me i am and lbs color is nice i liked the blue polka dot with flowery tie neck the tie neck is a nice on trend feature can be tired at different heights for different looks i think i will keep the xs regular,1
745,Love these so comfortable feels like wearing pajama leggings theyre stretchy but dont lose their shape and the fabric is super soft,1
746,I bought this jacket in the gray and couldnt be happier with it it is loose fitting but not oversized it will look great over a dress with boots or with jeans very versatile piece,1
747,Very comfortable fits true to size i also have this in white fits snug in the top but hangs loose around the waist making it very comfortable shirt is very flattering the polka dots add a playful touch super cute,1
748,As others have said this is cropped so will look funny with most pants that arent high waisted im going to try it with a few dresses before i return it the lining is adorable so i dont want to have to send it back,0
749,This was exactly the item i was looking for simple black stylish unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off the upper arms chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering,0
750,Gorgeous flowy dress thats great for three seasons thank you to the previous reviewers for the fit advice size small was only available and it fits perfectly on me im an ml on top im short and will have to hem because even with heels i kept stepping on the back skirt bodice opening is wide and gapes too much so i will wear a cami bra or fashion tape or have an additional fastener sewn in there are bright little balls of red trim and unexpected pops of violet embroidery adding to t,1
751,I love this dress for fall it is slightly sheer so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder one note i am and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length the xs is perfect for work as it hits me slightly above my knees,1
752,Super cute flowy and flattering i would buy again in a heartbeat,1
753,First off let me say that i am and dont often go for print jeans these days however these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldnt say no these look great cuffed for warmer temps and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters if you are looking for something fun and flattering these are the ticket i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have,1
754,This jacket is high quality leather and will bring you years of wear i made sure to add a little room to accommodate thick sweaters,1
755,No need to be on the fence about this top its lovely what you see pictured here is exactly what you get even the color of the top is accurate for reference im usually an xl apple shape c bust and this xl does not cling at all to me so you may even be able to size down the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering and thick enough not to need a cami all of the fabrics used are nice and soft and the details its going to be a beautiful spring,1
756,This dress is absolutely stunning i did agree with other reviewers that the skirt is very full i had it taken in and it fits exactly like the model,1
757,I ordered this top in the grey along with the white lace up back pocket tee while the other tee was totally see through and very poor quality this one delivers in every way in fact i am sending the other one back to get this top in the ivory as well the lace is very substantial and the fabric is not see through at all like so many tops are these days i ordered my usual medium and it comes down over my bum just like i wanted to wear with leggings i see this as a staple and this is my fir,1
758,I love the sweater online and even more in person i paired it with a long sleeve top with a bell sleeve and it looked great very bohemian look,1
759,Pretty and with pockets also nice quality for the price interesting texture,1
760,This dress will be perfect for the midseptember wedding im attending september is a transitional month fashionwise and this knit dress will be perfect the shimmer which isnt apparent from the website makes it festive enough for a wedding,1
761,Just as the others have reviewed i agree this dress is flowy and so feminine i got it today and i am wearing it now so light i usually wear a large or a in dresses i am pear shaped b bust and large hips it is flattering and feels great on the slip underneath fits perfect on me grab this before it becomes iso,1
762,I was a little hesitant to order this dress because of the asymmetric hem being very petite i thought it would be too bold for my small frame i loved the colors though i ordered the one in redand the the way the dress twirls and flows so i took a chanceand so glad i didthe dress is beautiful and unusual and so very flattering the top portion is of a heavier fabricso no see through at all the slanted cut of the white and tan portion is very slimming and flows beautifully into the r,1
763,Love this tshirt i rarely pay full price but love this and its already out of stock fits perfect i tend to be short waisted so the length is perfect,1
764,I wish i hadnt waited so long to buy this the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did but the medium ended up being totally fine perfect for a warmer winter it is pretty thin so i wouldnt trust it on its own to keep you warm in cold weather but easily could be layered i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties arent sewn,1
765,This top can be dressed up or down i got it in the blue motif it is so cute and that wearable washable fabric i am a medical student so it is important for me to be able to wash my clothing and not wear things too lowcut ie professionalism this top fits the bill while still being fabulous of course it is loosefitting on the bottom as the image indicates it is a swing top i recommend with skinny pants,1
766,I love this top super soft fabric and beautiful with jeans getting ready to retire and will make this a regular in my new wardrobe thanks retailer for putting it on sale,1
767,I absolutely loooove this skirt its just as depicted super comfy and warm got tons of compliments wearing it its just adorable the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters highly recommend,1
768,These pants are fabulous the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these i have a long torso and short muscular legs the style complimented by body type being culottes the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs i will probably have them hemmed the pleat has a nice kick to it now off to find the right pair of shoes,1
769,This sweater is quite lovely the yarn is light and delicate and the sweater is over all very feminine and figure flattering i bought the light red color which is quite attractive and im not usually a fan of reds and pinks this sweater can be worn casually with jeans or more dressed up for the office anyone that is looking for a sweater that can be worn with almost anything should defiantly consider this one,1
770,This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos but i ended up liking that better it is well made with thick but not too thick lined material also i was initially worried that the deep vneck may be too deep for my liking but once i had it onit looked classic and not showy i love the suit,1
771,I ordered the navy in an xl although am generally a medium or large in tops i sized up because it looked fitted and i think it was a good choice for me it fits just like the model but the back droops a bit and the neck is wider my bra is still covered in the back it fits perfectly in the waist and the elastic allows for some adjustment in placement theres layers of ruffles in the skirt portion im and was concerned it would be too young looking but i love the look it hits about an,1
772,This top is perfect i love the fit and the length and the weight of the fabric it is thin without being sheer i just wish there were other fun colors,1
773,Such a gorgeous top the detail and fit are amazing however after wearing the top for about hours of the center rinestones fell off the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body but i love the top so much i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around,1
774,Even at this kimono works for me because its so light in weight the length and amount of fabric are not at all overwhelming it can be dressy or casual as others have noted,1
775,A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull mine fits perfectly i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm just adore it,1
776,Love this top i ordered the pink and it was more of a dusty rose it also runs large i normally wear a medium top i am going to exchange it for white in small,1
777,This dress is lovely exactly as pictured on the site love the colorspattern and received so many compliments when i wore it to a brunch party could easily be dressed up for an outdoor wedding it definitely runs big i am usually an and originally ordered in a large was way too big so had to exchange for a m and there was still some room make sure you size down,1
778,I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress the silhouette the flouncy skirt however i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy dark colors,0
779,Just got this skirt in the mail and i am so happy i took a chance and ordered it my waist is a lot smaller than my hips so skirts can be a challenge but this one fit me perfectly it is casual but i can also see myself wearing this to work in the summer months it is super flattering and very comfortable the fabric is soft and it does have some give i am usually a size in pilcro chinos and the size in this skirt fit me perfectly so i would say it runs true to size a great addition to,1
780,Beautiful flattering blouse,1
781,Love the fabric so soft and comfortable it gives a very flattering silhouette love those pants,1
782,I havent loved the look of something so much in a while as this skirt in the green motif which i spotted in my durham store so i ordered it in the xspetite my usual retailer size lbs hips waist average torso length short legs if you have smaller than a inch waist the waist of the xsp will probably be too big id say this skirt is exactly as pictured the fabric is a thickish textured knit on the outside with a thin green very soft jersey lining you have to be,1
783,This is a great top runs tts looks great with cropped skinny jeans and booties or wedges in the spring,1
784,Just received my second pair of pilcro legging jeans having bought them last year as well great for work girls night out date night so comfortable with lots of stretch fortunately they hold their shape and dont stretch out they feel like pjs but are nice enough for work my pair from last year have held up well colorwise however some of the leg seam stitching unraveled hence the reason for stars in quality hopefully these will fare betterregardless i highly recommend,1
785,I love this dress i think the cut fabric and embroidery are all flattering this dress is comfortable and can be dressed up or down i am and weigh anywhere from lbs i at first tried on the xxs petite and liked the look but found it to be tight in the arm area they didnt have an xs petite so i tried on the s petite to see if there was any major difference there totally was so i ordered the xs petite online and cant wait to get it,1
786,The photo doesnt do it justice the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans texture is light and gauzey but i dont find it too seethough sizing was tough im but thin on top usually between xs s and went with the xs on this ordered both to try sacrificing some length for a more flattering width great for the sale price,1
787,Perfect cant believe how inexpensive this is for the look it looks just like it does on the model i cant wait to wear it on my vacation,1
788,Love i always used to wear skinny jeans until i discovered these highly recommend they elongate your legs and curve in just the right places super flattering plus they are extremely comfortable however im ft inches and i have to wear a good inch heel with them,1
789,I purchased this shirt and was hoping to be able to wear it without a tank underneath because of the lace detailing on the back however this shirt is a bit seethrough so i still had to wear a tank with it its very cute even with the tank though,1
790,This top is one of my retailer faves it is so comfortable and love the quality and design i receive many compliments on this top i usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops and the xs was a little tight in the arms the dressing room attendant suggested ordering a petite small so i wouldnt lose the shape so glad i did it fits perfect i even ordered when it was on sale the gray color is perfect its not too thick or thin,1
791,This top is gorgeous and flattering for spring the fit is beautiful one thing i find that the seam that goes across the stomach does chafe a little bit however with a light tank underneath this is no issue at all and the top is well worth it,1
792,Ok you had me at the western scene soft and comfortable true to size you can dress it up or down just a great t shirt recommend it get it,1
793,I love this top the fabric is soft and a silky lightweight perfect for summer i feel it runs a size large im lbs with broad shoulders i usually wear a medium but a small fit perfectly,1
794,I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily other than that the silhouette of the coat is perfectnot too boxy its also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter i love it,1
795,Absolutely love this dress this was my first purchase from this site and as per the usual i was worried about the sizing but the fit couldnt be better definitely wont be the last material is heavenly and has a double layering that was a nice surprise very warm and soft high quality stuff i could have gotten my usual size in petite but i didnt want it to be too short im glad i did this is the perfect dress for work,1
796,I love this dress because it is amazingly feminine and easy to wear i put this dress on and immediately felt elegant sophisticated and flirty all at the same time a few tailoring uniquenesses i want to mention stretchy form fitting sexy sheer upper and front back panel you can wear a bra and not see it thru the sheer front and back portions of the dress the waist is exactly tailored to show off back side it is true to size,1
797,This dress did not work well on my figure i have a small waist and broad hips and the dress size m for lbs was too boxy i didnt have objections to the fabric like other reviewers honestly even if there were a snag or two the fabric is kind of rustic and i dont think a snag would look terrible depending on where it is i should note that one of the ornamental buttons immediately fell off the dress upon arrival my friend got the same dress in a size s and it worked better f,0
798,I love a crisp white poplin blouse and this top is perfect in that role i am between a small and medium in retailer tops because this top looked a little bell in the model photos i decided to order a it was a bit snug across the chest for reference i am a c i returned it for the and it fit perfect im not sure why this top was offered during the winter because it will likely hang in my closet until april highly recommend this blouse for summer,1
799,I love this kimono it fits great and is gorgeous,1
800,I ordered this vest in xxs since i am usually an xs and was looking for a bit of a tighter fit on such a loose vest even then the vest looked like a large not only was it incredibly loose much looser than in looks in the picture but the arm holes were huge too it just looked too big not artfully drapey,0
801,I ordered the red in a size xl the fit is perfectit matches the models photos the material is so soft its definitely a cozy fabric the red color description is wrong but the photo accurately shows how its really an orange shade the color is cheery since its bright it will be great to use on cold days,1
802,Great top for all seasons hides imperfections flatters hourglass shapes and great thicknessweight to fabric im wearing it to a concert with skinny moto jeans and booties side zip is excellent feature and great quality,1
803,Love the colors on this adorable flattering style,1
804,Have not worn them yet but they are so soft and pretty seems like a good item to travel with,1
805,Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy great with jeansshorts or slacks with a jacket for the office beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps its not that big a deal,1
806,Love this top bc its very feminine got this at off and its very flattering,1
807,Really like the cut its tough for petites to find good joggers and these hit the mark light easy comfy great with heels for work or sandals on the weekend,1
808,For an athro top this is a good price point especially for such a beautiful piece its really just a basic tee but the lace insets bring it up several notches and its much prettier than the picture shows i think it fits very true to size im normally a size small and got that size with this d lbs although the lace is very sheer i really couldnt see my nude bra through it so dont feel ill need a cami because that would ruin the delicate design of this,1
809,Have worn this top multiple times with jeans neckline makes even those of us who are small busted look great up top,1
810,This is a beautiful dress the quality is excellent the layers and the embroidery are beautiful however it just didnt look right on me it looked like a maternity dress i am very petite short with a big bust and it just did nothing for me i think this style would look best on a tall woman with a smaller bust unfortunately i will be returning this dress,0
811,This multiseason dress fits beautifully the colors are vibrant and the skirt has a nice weight drape and swing to it the skirt is slightly asymmetrical as some reviewers noted but its probably not noticeable to anyone but the wearer,1
812,Great tee i usually wear an xs but ended up getting this in xxsp it is very long but the petite worked perfect on my frame,1
813,This sweatertunic is very poor quality the seams looked like they were about to come apart as soon as i got it and without a chunky statement necklace it looks like your grandmothers apron there just isnt any style to it has to go back,0
814,This tee has a loose fit very comfortable covers my backside with inches to spare flattering fit although oversized im a smallmedium in most retailer tops the small fit me nicely dd lbs bought it in olive and mustard great for layering or weekends,1
815,Do not buy this dress for full price the design looks great but after receiving the dress the material is made of extremely cheap slinkyish polyester that you would find at a f store the stitching is horrific and created an uneven hump on the back seam just absolutely poor poor quality,0
816,I think shorts are the best length if you want to show off your legs but still feel comfortable running errands and these fit the bill they are short but they are loose the pattern i got the grey is nice wore them with a black top that flowed over the waistband and felt they were perfect memorial day wore them days in a row all day everywhere got lots of compliments comfortable washed and air dried ready to go again i am typically a ordered the large could probably,1
817,I bought this in the sky color and sized down from my normal medium and absolutely love it i dont think its boxy at all on the contrary i love the way it hangs i dont find it to be short either though i do tend to layer with a longer cami underneath ps the ruffle detail is precious,1
818,I love this shirt because when i first saw it i wasnt sure if it was a shirt or dress since it is seethrough if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings i bought a slip wore the tie in the back and rocked it with white wedges you could also wear it as a vest be careful with the buttons i havent had any fall off yet but i feel like they will overall its great for any occasion and its fun to wear,1
819,I had my eye on this for a while and finally picked it up on sale i got the darker blue in xs great piece fits well very cozy but the cuffs add such cute detail,1
820,I tried this in the store and i liked it the color is very pretty and the fabric is soft and drapey and feels like good quality i like the little subtle dots i ultimately did not buy it because the tie at the throat is not my style and because i just dont need this kind of piece enough in my wardrobe at the moment but it is a very nice top and i would recommend it if you like the color and style,1
821,Given that i am petite with thighs take a size p or p these were not for me the run small are really tight from the thigh up run longer that a petite should and are fairly thin on top of that the zipper and hook in the back are really inconvenient i was looking for something i could wear to work and these were not the right style for that plus they seemed cheaply made like they wouldnt stand the test of time i imagine if you are tall and skinny like the model they would look good,0
822,I ordered these in both the grey and moss and i love both they are very soft very easy loose fitting casual shorts i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured so they hit lower on my leg than on the model which i prefer in these i am lbs ordered xs the dark grey ones feel more versatile like you could throw on anything with them and go the moss look cute with whitecream summery tops they washed well machine cold laid flat to dry touched up with light steam from,1
823,This is one of the cutest tops ive ever gotten from retailer the material is very soft and flowing it fits true to size and hange beautifully love it i should have gotten he turquoise one too,1
824,I love this dress i was actually able to fit in a l versus my usual xl due to the style of the dress a bigger chest person im a d may not find the dress as well fitting as i do overall great fit can easily dress it warm with a scarf boots hat or best a great dress for fallspring,1
825,This shirt has beautiful colors in it it goes with burgundy grey black brown blues and denim its a generous cut and quite lightweight for fall layering,1
826,This skirt is gorgeous im glad i saw it instore as the picture online does not do it justice the colors are really rich and the pattern has a sentimental vintage feeling it also has pockets and a great glamorous swing to it this skirt is great for work with a blouse and heels and also looks awesome with a tshirt tucked in and sandals the fabric has a really nice four season weight i think it will also look great with high boots and a turtleneck in the autumn i get so many compliments,1
827,Im so glad to own this one i just tried it today and fully satisfied as always with pilcro true to size perfect colorhigh waisted and flare just right can be paired with cropped top or peasant top looking taller on this outfitbest of all i got it on sale,1
828,I own this tank in three different colors and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up they are soft good quality and wash up well ive taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase and also have used them as little camisole shirts they dont fit too tight on just right i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in,1
829,As other reviewers have said the colors are more muted but good fall colors quality top with lining and bead detail on hem and sleeves flowy loose fit very cute with skinny jeans and booties i would size down if you are small chested great boho top,1
830,This is a beautiful simple yet feminine top a little tight in the bust on me so i had to size up and i am not busty for reference i am b im probably in between a small and xsmall on this but went with the small,1
831,This dress is very cute the material is high quality and as others have mentioned it isnt jet black but more muted the cut of the neckline is very flattering and the pockets are definitely a bonus you could dress this up or down with flats or heels its very versatile it will be perfect for summer and in the evening you can throw a sweater or even a moto jacket over it definitely worth every penny,1
832,These pants fit great i ordered my normal medium and they fit perfectly i was worried that they may look too much like pajamas and lot look right with my stomach but no issues there i think i will get a lot of use out of these,1
833,Love this tee it has a drapery cut which i love the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller,1
834,This shirt is wonderful i totally recommend it for everyone,1
835,At first i thought that this sweater would be too thin and show any imperfections but it doesnt the vertical ribbing really gives it a slimming effect and it is a perfect lightweight cover up that goes with pretty much anything,1
836,I saw this dress in store at first i was not impressed because it was shapeless on but i added a belt and it was so much better i styled it with my leather wrap around ada belt looks great with a jean jacket or a leather jacket to make it look more chic,1
837,I love everything about these pants the color the fit the detail oh and these have a button fly i didnt realize that when i ordered them but i love it i havent had a pair of button fly pants in so long these have a nice stretch to them as well hei hei knows what theyre doing and i got them on sale thank you retailer,1
838,Sits at waist length is perfect for petite quality is very good looks very nice on me very recommend,1
839,I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt its comfortable the fit is excellent and flattering and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets,1
840,I bought this dress for a christmas party and received lots of compliments at even though i live in a cold climate i was looking for something not black stylish and comfortable that i would not roast in at a party it is a beautiful green color with nice embroidery front and back and the shape is very boho i like my dresses a little more fitted so i bought the xs and i am usually a small so size down and had the waist nipped in a bit by my seamstress to give it more of a flatteri,1
841,I love this dress but sadly for me it didnt look good on my body type im a dd and not thin so it made me look like a beached whale i saw it on two different sales clerks in the stoe and they both looked adorable,1
842,Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception looks just like the pictures colorscutdrape with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep vneck sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff this dress does not stretchthe bodice felt very fitted and tight especially at the waist band runs tts or small if youre bustybroad shouldered size up it has a dreadful side zip is fully lined and all synthetic fabric boo i purchased size p my stats c,1
843,These cords are so soft and snug on like a hug for your lower half i appreciate their lack of stretch they dont seem to bag out like other cords can i like that the fabric is soft but the shape is more stiff the grey is slightly lightermore silvery in real life than the picture depicts for ref im and lbs and i bought the p,1
844,Looked good in pictures i even ordered an xxs petite and it was huge although the sweater has interesting textures and is very beautiful it is very awkward and poor fit will be sending back,0
845,First saw the jacket online and liked it so i went to the store to check out the color looks nicer in person it fitted me really well and looked really nice on me the jacket is very soft and well made the only thing is the sleeves are a little longer but not a big deal cant wait to wear it when the full is here,1
846,Normally i am a size or but i sized down to a small still very swingy and beautiful i bought the pink and the taupe as well the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains,1
847,This dress is so cute i couldnt make it work because my long torso,1
848,Ive seriously been on the hunt for a olive green militaryish style skirt for a couple years now and i think ive found it the color is great the finishings are coolrose gold buttons i actually like the aline it give me room to sit down without riding up the waist is pretty fitted verging on tight and i ordered an im usually a or in bottoms but i need to trim off a few pounds from a recent vaca so im keeping the it will probably be perfect soon enough the length is just,1
849,I purchased this top in the black and tan color loved the fit style and fabric however it is a loose weave and after just one wearing a hole opened up on the front which could not be repaired it was covered by the cowl neck collar but as the day wore on the hole got bagger and it can no longer be hidden i was very disappointed in the quality of this top i purchased it at full price and was only able to wear it once i just didnt have the time to return it to the store,0
850,I bought this top on sale very glad i did not pay full price for it i wash everything before i wear it when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot but the hole will be a little trickier as the material is kind of filmy,0
851,Love this sweater it fits true to size fun and different purchased off but i dont think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget,1
852,I purchased this top in a great sale fits greattrue to size i am xsmallsmall for reference purchased small i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable it would be great in the fall with a cardigan sweater or a blazer super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans,1
853,Best jeggings ever they look and fit like skinny jeans but feel like leggings soft but substantial fabric nice dark gray worn in color,1
854,I love this jacket lets be clear thoughits not for warmth just for style but its perfect for fall in california i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers a light blue tank off white shirt tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often i bought my usual size small sleeves are a bit long for my frame but they didnt have in petite and it looks great,1
855,Nice flowing summer sun dress i was looking for something very simple and put a colorful kimono over it i put a bando under it i think this dress can be for all ages as my friend in her s bought and loves this dress as well,1
856,Great dress that can be casual or dressy wellmade and comes witha builtin slip,1
857,I love the serif jeans and these stet midrise jeans fit perfectly too true to size and i really like the wash i am and a size and the fits just right because of my height they come closer to the ankle on me than what you see on the model i have more of an athletic build rather than curvy,1
858,for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants they are thin and a little on the long side but very flattering plus the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights i love the pockets not a big fan of the tie on the front but thats just a personal preference i wont just be wearing these on the weekend i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something ill b,1
859,I love this vest there are so many ways to style itopen or tied closed over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans i get compliments every time i wear it its soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavyhot to wear all day,1
860,I dont usually go for swing style dresses as i am petite but this one was totally cute i like the color a lot wasnt sure it would work as i am rather pale but it is nice the xs p was returned at my store why i tried it on winner lbs in waist dd chest i can see myself wearing this in summer spring or fall with boots,1
861,I love this top usually i prefer neutral colors but i looked at every one of the colors and fell in love with the pink i think it looks the best with the embroidery at the top i too love this cut on my shoulders for summer i would definitely recommend this top i bought an xs and its perfect this shirt made me feel like twirling i love it,1
862,This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors cant wait to pair it with my wine color booties,1
863,This top immediately caught my eye in the store not only that it was the pink color and i dont usually gravitate towards pink i live in a warm weather area so i can get good use of these tops year round i say tops because i bought a second top in the green a couple days later you can definitely see your bra when you raise your arms but this top is just so soft and breezy,1
864,This sweater was far better than expected very soft and flattering its light to wear but keeps me cozy in my freezing office looks super cute with jeans and boots,1
865,My daughter tried on this shirt in new york loved it so i ordered it for her for christmas i am thrilled she will be thrilled love my purchase,1
866,Love this dress the other reviews were accurate it is a lot of fabric and i cant decide whether i will actually use the belt that it came with but i think it would be a great beachy dress for the summer,1
867,I initially walked right by these pants when i saw them on the rack then i saw them on the fitting room attendant they looked amazing i ended up purchasing them and i love them the great thing about them is the the leather is only in the front which makes it great for moving around and sitting down the back is kinda legging like i had to size down in these,1
868,This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it it was uneven and stretched out it looked like it was not well made to me it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz i returned this one,0
869,Perfect for dressing up or dressing down with a pair of jeans this pullover can be worn during all four seasons of michigans weather which is a bonus for me it can also be paired with heels booties or flats making it extremely versatile,1
870,Love love this top fabric is nice and soft looks great with leggings love the way it falls in the front an long enough in the back,1
871,The photos do not do this skirt justice im so glad i picked it up in the store as i would not have given it a second look online it is soft stretchy forgiving and one of the most versatile pieces in my closet i dressed it up for an evening event and cant wait to throw it on with a tee and jean jacket love it,1
872,I really liked this little cardigan so simple light weight and comfy i have grabbed it and put it on times the first week i got it,1
873,I was excited to receive this top it looked great online vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves when i tried it on the fabric looked and felt cheap it is not a flowy top do not recommend it,0
874,I wore this to a gala and i plan on wearing it over and over again the dress is very comfortable and looks polished i wore this dress for hours and did not want to take it off the embroidery is beautiful and appears to be well done i am and the dress hit me inches above my knee i highly recommend this dress i received so many compliments,1
875,This top is my favorite spring item the color is a soft petal but it doesnt wash me out im a sandy paleface and the details make it special the cut is a little wide i sized down but its also forgiving and perfect with slim pants or a pencil skirt its really a find,1
876,I love wearing this so much i wear it with leggings jeans and i also like to pair it with is a long linen skirt that i have i purchased it in plum and then went back for a second in moss i got them before they went on sale for fear theyd be out of my size i am very happy with my purchase i highly recommend,1
877,I generally dont spend this much on jeans but wanted a nice black pair so rolled the dice during the sale who can wear these im an average size and struggled to get these size s over my hips buttoned and zipped i looked like a stuffed black sausage best for thin frames and even then size up,0
878,I agree with other reviews this shirt is more like a thin sweater it is so soft i was walking around the first time i wore it asking people to pet me i just got it on sale and wore it twice this week already ive gotten so many compliments i bought this on sale in grey i love it so much that i just bought a navy and burgundy one too it runs slightly large but i like my comfortable sweaters to fit large definitely an important staple to any wardrobe,1
879,This is my third byron lars and as usual it is absolutely gorgeous and so worth the price it completely flatters the body and all the details add so much interest creating a very unique dress,1
880,The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess it was overall too large the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining i would have liked it better the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out returned,0
881,This dress is very versatile and i plan to use in all year round with some tights and boots in the fallwinter and strappy sandals in springsummer i originally purchased this dress in a m but had to size down for a more snug and flattering fit the navy is much darker than the picture,1
882,I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online and decided to order it the fabric is soft but strong and the color is just as pictured perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends,1
883,I tried on the xs in store but ti was a little big on me and i usually get petite in dresses unless they are mini dressesso i decide to order the xxs petite it fits much better the length is at the highest point just above my knees the chest part fits better on me as xxs p the plunge is not low not too high and is flattering i can wear a regular bra that can attach as tback and you wont see anything the model on the picture is what it looks like as a usual size so xs instea,1
884,I wanted to like this top especially because of its comfortable material and color but the asymmetrical shape didnt hang well on me it also runs big i got a small and although the bodice fit okay the sleeves were long and the bottom of the top looked mishaped and dumpy this top will be going back,0
885,I have been searching for the perfect white shirt this is it i love how the collar lays and the longer length and frayed hem are perfection the fabric is super soft too i am very pleased with this purchase,1
886,This sweater has the weirdest stitching although the buttons on the sleeves are a nice touch and the hunter green color is to diepoor fit means poor sweater,0
887,This will be a frequently worn item print is beautiful and the fit is comfy and classy,1
888,Very flattering on im lbs and took a small i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on the only weird thing for me is getting it onyou had to step thru the opening on top there are no zippers buttons and if you have larger hips or butt it will be a challenge to get on once on it looks great and believe it or not roomy,1
889,Loved the fit and colors but the fabric is very thin and seethru i tried a nude cami underneath and the cami was completely visible it did not look appropriate for anything that i wanted to wear the top to,0
890,I got to try this on today and i really like it the fabric is a normal tshirt kind of fabric i was hoping it would have been kind of special and the vneck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing i would feel comfortable wearing it asis outside of work but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work normally i am not a huge fan of vneck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks camis these days are often made with a versatile v and,1
891,I love this vest bought it in green and want to order white its very flattering and i wore it with a black tank top ripped faded stevie cropped jeans and gold gladiators i would like to mention the care i dripped something on the lapel so i tried cleaning it off with a wet towel it made a lighter mark so i washed as recommended in cold water on gentle in the machine i hung it to dry and it dried stiff and a little wrinkled so i threw it in the dryer to soften it up it lightened up a,1
892,This top is absolutely beautiful the fabric is great the cut is nice etc however the buttons are too big for the button loops which do not have any stretch it took ten minutes to open the shirt to try it on once i had it on i left it unbuttoned i returned it if you cant live without it you could put smaller buttons on it too pricey for a nonfunctioning top too bad,0
893,Super cute and comfy bottom of the legs have about a in slit that is not shown in pictures also the hem came unraveled after the first wear worth the money on sale received many compliments not see through,1
894,I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale i finally bought it during the off retailer members day sized up from my usual size to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free the rest still fits way i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this,1
895,This jacket is a great buy at the sale price drape is wonderful and the weight is nice lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well definitely recommend,1
896,Ill start by saying over the years i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailers products this dress represents all of my frustration cheap cheap cheap material low thread count elastic around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm i mean this dress is a total disaster and looks nothing like the photograph shown,0
897,This is my first one piece bathing suit and i absolutely love it the quality is great the color doesnt fadei usually wear a size but i ordered a size and it fits perfectly,1
898,I love the pattern adn color combo but wowt really flatering on me too much fabric i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu anyway not for me but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me too badlength was decent in regulat size though not too long just too wide,0
899,Fit is true to size color is accurate love the feel of the knit its weightier than if anticipated im looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips,1
900,This is a very comfortable top versatile in that you can dress it up or down im happy with it,1
901,So disappointing everything ive owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time one wash and this was ruined shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry completely ruined returned it,0
902,Beautiful fall colors perfect with work pants or jeans im tall and was a little worried it would be too short but it was a good fit,1
903,I love this blouse with a pair of jeans the neckline is fairly deep but very flattering and feminine the detail is beautiful,1
904,This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer cant wait until cooler weather so i may live in it also when you have it on for a bit it seems to,1
905,This is a great fitting jacket the style etci got this in the grey i would have exchanged it for the green but have a similar color that i bought last year from retailerso i ended up returning it only because i didnt like the color on me,1
906,Not a tunic unless the model pictured is barely covered my backside and not as advertised design on top is interesting and the fabric is soft so its a good buy if off or more,0
907,This top was originally way overpriced so i ordered it on sale for half price still overpriced it arrived yesterday and frankly i am disappointed the quality is not great it is like a jersey type material doesnt look like the photograph at all i like the color but frankly thats about it,0
908,Im months pregnant and bought this dress yesterday it is perfect the wrap design makes it possible to expand the skirt and still look cute im bought the small and look forward to wearing this after i deliver as well,1
909,I am so glad i did not wait to order this dress the fit is great and is made with great material i am lbs and ordered a often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress the length falls right at my knee it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit a very cure feature the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice,1
910,Just bought the patterned and gray the small fit perfect i do have a short torso though chest size dd i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasnt sure of great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts,1
911,I love this tee the fabric is very comfortable and the vneck is not too deep for petites,1
912,I purchased the coral color im usually between an xs and small in this brand and i felt the top runs a tad small so the small fit much better simple and flattering top,1
913,These are absolutely fabulous love them comfortable great fabric best buy of the year so far,1
914,The top was very small i am usually a size small but this was tight around the top arm holes and it was short also i didnt notice if it said it was sheer see through in the description but it definitely requires another shirt underneath,0
915,This vest is a great fall item the asymmetrical design and unusual buttons really give it interest even though it is black you could wear it open or closed both look cute appears to be high quality,1
916,This dress is breathtaking in person the back tie the lace on the sides the hem the sleeves the pleats at the chest and the liner is opaque so its not seethrough but its very white baby doll cut and very short in order to avoid the maternity weddingish look a few rules must be applied thanks to retailer stylist buttons all the way up a belt is a must to break the monotony of the allover white and lace look i purchased size regular and it still falls about inches above m,1
917,Everyone else who reviewed felt the dress fit quite odd i have an oddly shaped body so this dress was perfect on me the bigger bodice fit on my large broad rounded upper body skimmed my true waist and flared out to complimentary skirt that wasnt too twee the silhouette evens out my odd figure the fabric is a gorgeous pinkorangeteal pattern on comfortable cotton i do have to agree with the lowness of the neckline its a bit immodest i wear my cropped denim jacket and a simple la,1
918,Love this skirt i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit i have had many compliments on it it is very flattering and comfortable,1
919,I love this shirt it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun its very soft and comfortable i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors,1
920,I ordered this dress is in the yelloworange the colors are pretty the pink detail is nice and thats about it the slip underneath is a form fitting yellow cotton no big deal the dress itself runs very large and in an unflattering way if i was pregnant it was perfect the material feels cheap to me and this along with the roomy fit is why this dress will be returned,0
921,Absolutely perfect staple top to have in your wardrobe fits very nicely not see through at all highly recommend this top,1
922,When i saw the dress i loved everything about it except the arms made me a little nervous i ordered it when it went on sale and it turns it the arms are worse then i thought they would be they are like my grandmother crochet it and accidentally attached my childs dress arms on my dress,0
923,This is no exception to the rule i love turtlenecks and this one is going to be a favorite do know that this is not lightweighteven though this is sleeveless it is definitely a substantial knit the color is a beautiful nutmeg and can be dressed up or down i purchased a gorgeous neutral beaded necklace to go with it and it is simply stunning it does bell out a little at the bottom which in my opinionis the only design flaw i normally wear a medium in most retailer tops and the small is a,1
924,So glad i purchased this top it has great style and can be matched with just about everything the material is very soft and it seems really durable,1
925,Saw this top online and immediately had to purchase it the first time i wore it i received many compliments even my husband commented how cute it is as shown in the photo the back is longer than the front i am and my top fell as the models does love this top and so happy with my purchase i bought a size small i normally wear medium or small tops fit runs a little large but small fit perfect,1
926,These are the most comfortable pants i own i bought them in the gold green and gray which really does look more like a grayish purple the gold is my favorite it goes with so many things i was just checking to see if there were any other colors would love them in black and a burgundy im about lbs foot and the is a perfect fit the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out but i havent found that to be a real problem,1
927,Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt longer on me than in photo but im only i usually wear a size or waist jeans but i could not zip up the large by several inches im not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way sad because ive had my eye on this for months,1
928,I run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did the fit is lovely and flattering i loved this shirt the second i put it on then went to order it in another color,1
929,The fit of this top is nothing like in the photo the blouse on the model must be pinned back to achieve that fitted silhouette in reality this top is baggy and boxy and runs at least one size large the embroidery details and soft material are great but the fit is off entirely this item is going back,0
930,Love just know the embroidery is navy blue wearing them today size down,1
931,I loved this dress so much i bought in the creampink as well as the blueteal it is so light and easy to throw on the slits are higher on me i am but not in a risqu way its very flattering and gives it a little sassinessi wish they had even more colors to choose from that is how obsessed i am with it,1
932,I love this top in fact when i saw in the store i was hoping that it would go on sale i wore it and received many compliments the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed this top does run large i normally wear a and i ordered this in a and it fits perfectly i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home,1
933,So flattering the length is perfect and hits just above the knee in front slightly longer on sides i was looking for a versatile dress that could be worn to church work luncheons or casual evening events this one fits the bill i love that it pays homage to the bohopeasant trend without being shapeless or making me look too wide i am long torso lbs d and the small fit perfectly i got the black motif print,1
934,The green is vibrant and beautiful and the sweater is very soft,1
935,Well another major score with pilcrothese pants in general are my goto pantsso i had high expectations when i bought themi have about every color in the hyphen cutand always hope they make more pairsand what do you know theyve meteven exceeded these expectationslove the fittrue to sizeeven though i will order another smaller size when i get smaller these are good enough to have that big pair and that oh i feel svelte pair the denim has just enough stretch a,1
936,This dress runs so large why did they not make an extra small the material and detail are great the flow in the back is different but is flattering i wish wish that they made this in the extra small i was swimming in it there was no way to fix it so it went back,0
937,I saw this jacket in the store and it looks and fit beautiful it fits tts and is forgiving to the curvy this is a staple piece to have during the fall or spring highly recommend,1
938,Got this poncho for christmas and loved it the moment i got it out of the box great quality and looks great cant go wrong with this purchase,1
939,I absolutely love these sleep pants they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didnt fade or shrink grab a pair while you still can you wont regret it,1
940,I absolutely love this jacket as a year old woman i want items that are on trend but dont look juvenile this jacket hits the nail on the head for me,1
941,Love the print and was looking forward to this dress the length and bust are just right in normal sizing however the swing effect is all off theres so much fabric its like wearing a moo moo not at all flattering disappointed in this one,0
942,I bought this to wear to and english garden themed party and i loved it for this event it is very bright maybe even more than the pictures if thats possible and the skirt is was long on my frame so i had to get it it hemmed several inches so that it didnt give the s housewife look it was comfortable and i the skirt had just enough poof to make me feel great i could wear a regular bra but not sure where else im going to wear this but im going to try to come find another event worthy,1
943,I wanted to love this dress the material is beautiful but sadly i agree with other reviewer the model definitely has this pinned back i am on the small side lbs straight figure very tiny girls and this dress looked awful totally swallowed what little shape i have and the swing did make me look prego in front and back the fabric is stiff so i think that adds to the sticking out oddly as far as sizing the arm jokes fit great xs ordered and length was good but wish the swin,0
944,Love these the raw hem is ontrend length is great im material is the classic pilcro washed chinos perfect as with all pilcro pants they stretch a bit,1
945,These jeans fit true to size and they look amazing i wear a and have an athletic build and they look great everywhere i love how they look with sandals,1
946,Bought this on a whim cocoon sweaters usually do not work for me this cardigan is very cute more of a dark gray if it they carry again grab it,1
947,I wasnt immediately attracted to this shirt but decided to try it on i loved it onit is comfortable and very flattering im a small person and the length wasnt overbearing on me it was full but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person im not sure how it works on a fuller person but my guess is it may surprise you,1
948,The cut is brilliantthe wash is subtlethe weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuffand the stretch is just right love it the perfect staple a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring,1
949,I love these pants i ordered mine in green and retailer definitely offers vanity sizing but i love them super cute and comfortable i wish they had more colors available these were a great buy,1
950,Love this top i have it in several colors and im waiting for the black to be restocked its somewhat sheer perfect w my kimonos,1
951,I am usually a petite but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on and it fit im lbs so dress hit rt below knee will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelmingthis dress looks stunning on great vibrant color i have dark hair makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish when i tried it on in store salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it i did and am gladi plan to wear it this spring for my daughte,1
952,I was in love with this suit from the pictures unfortunately the top is a little too short so the peplum skirt hits right at my widest part and doesnt meet the bikini bottoms,0
953,This sweater is perfect for fallits roomy warm super comfy and the color really pops,1
954,I agree with the reviewer that said this product photo is misleading you cant possibly wear this sweater off the shoulder as pictured it does however provide a great fit i sized down from large to mediumand the brown color is really pretty,0
955,Love these leggings great fit great look perfect with boots and oversized sweater bought a couple of different fabrics highly recommend,1
956,Overall this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece and i wanted something unique and different i ordered the chevron print and i do love the colors and retro look of the swimsuit if i could change a couple of things i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut but not much and i might have wanted the option to take off some if not all of the straps other than that i do love itand i doubt that anyone else,1
957,I think this is the first time ive successfully purchased pants online i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones i gave it a shot with these and bingo they are great they are a bit longer on me than on the model because i am and did not order a petite i still like how they look hitting just above my ankle just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads,1
958,I really like this dress a lot the material is soft and comfortable it is clingy but not in a bad way the design can camouflage some figure problems i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beigepink belt which worked great cant say enough about how comfortable this dress is,1
959,This dress has rich color excellent quality fabric and wonderful style you can wear it now for fall with boots and jean jacket or in the summer for a great sun dress,1
960,This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually being tall i love how long this shirt is definitely recommend,1
961,I fell in love with these cropped pants first purchased a size but realized that they do run true to size so i exchanged for a i usually wear an pant sizei am so happy with these chinos,1
962,This is a great summer maxi dress i am lbs about a size in dresses dd i got this in an extra small i was really happy that on someone my height its just a few inches above my ankle so did not shorten me at all the straps were a good length and the waist hit at the right spot i dont think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra and skirt is lined the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric,1
963,Other reviews are right it is a little short in front but its such an adorable dress that i dont care i love the material super soft,1
964,Love these chinos super soft and amazingly comfyand quite flattering for wideleg pants,1
965,Bought a pair of these with a gift card i got for my birthday just ordered another pair i love them for everyday use and working out,1
966,Longtime ag jeans fan lately though im finding the material is much too stretchy i wanted a good pair of jeans if i wanted pajama jeans i wouldve ordered them i found the same thing with the steve capris i ordered same review thereso back both pairs went its a shame because the color was as pictured and just what i wanted if only they had been made out of actual jeans material,0
967,Purchased in the red and love it love that it goes with anything from work pants to jean shorts the ruffle details add just a little extra which makes it perfect i just paired with gray chinos a couple days ago and it made a lovely outfit fits tts i wear an xs and purchased that,1
968,Love this tunic i am a curvy gal with a few extra curves in the middle and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy pink a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture i found it true to size typically i wear a medium or large depending on the structure and the medium fit well a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas it is,1
969,These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time im and pounds and the fit with a bit of extra room in the waistnot enough to size down i love that they are not skinnyso over the skinny fit i plan to wear these with black heels white tee and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same timeoh and a statement necklacealways a statement necklace these are a must for every fall wardrobe more pants like these please,1

971,I ordered this jacket to complement the larkin dress by moulinette soeurs which i planned to wear to a funeral the pair together were perfect the jacket added just the right touch in fashion and practical warmth on a sunny but chilly february morning in alexandria va i ordered my usual size and it fit perfectly if not a tad bit large but then im not very tall so occasionally items have more material than i need but i never worry about that since it doesnt usually affect the lines of th,1
972,I was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews but i love it granted i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy its summer in socal but cover up my tummy the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type insetso not a real bra but at least something there i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect really happy with this top,1

979,I really wanted to like this dress the color is perfect the design and cut are cut not always the case at retailer however the fabric quality was terrible a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back,0
980,I love this pant it is so soft and has some stretch in it the first pair i tried in a size and the sales associate suggested trying a size as ithis pant should not fit tight as it is a trouser tie is perfect it reminds me of a retro pantwhich i love,1

988,I bought my typical size xs and it fits perfectly its loose but not overly baggy which is what i was looking for the material seems very durable my concern with all white tops is being too thin and see through and that was not the case with this shirt the front comes right above my crotch and the back covers my cushion ive only worn it once and that was with some bootcut jeans booties simple earrings and a statement necklace i highly recommend it,1
989,True to size and lovely colors bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it,1
990,I tried this on blue in size or xs not sure how sizing was regular size sometimes i need petite i dont think i need petite in this one though i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem the whole tank is very soft probably need a strapless bra to wear it but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants pencil skirt for dressier look i am lbs and dd for reference,1
991,Tried it on a whim and could not leave it behind size took a something about the pocket placement fabric weight cut and color make this one a real winner for me plan to wear it with a creme windowpane coat,1
992,There is simply no way to wear a bra with this top that being said the cotton is substantive and crisp the embroidery striking the coral color bright and summery it hits me exactly where my hips begin to broaden which i honestly kind of hate but the top is so lovely no ones going to be assessing your hips if you have narrow hips and perky breasts though what a perfect summer top although i suppose if those are your features every top is perfect,1
993,I usually try to buy things on sale but after trying this dress on twice i didnt want to run the risk of waiting and it selling out it is extremely flattering and i think it will be very versatile ill definitely wear this dress to work out with friends and you could also wear it to bridalbaby shower events as well i bought the dress in blue and it is extremely comfortable i do think it runs large i am lbs with a very straight no hips athletic build have an athlete butt,1
994,I am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans based on the other reviewer i ordered one size up and they fit perfectly im and appreciate the longer inseam i cant wear a wedge heel or anything with them but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly youll love the raw hemline and the subtle wear throughout the fabric its not overdone just like in the picture they really seem to narrow the hip think page boy style very very flattering,1
995,These look great on my wife very versatile and go with like of her wardrobe she raves about them and they look great,1
996,This romper is absolutely gorgeous the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering its super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it im in love it is a little on the sheer side though and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage but this was an easy fix it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material totally obsessed,1
997,Love everything about this dresscut color material and price,1
998,When i first tried this top on i didnt like it because the chest just spilled open i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try i bought it in both the red and the black and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed it is very slimming and hides tummymuffin top issues i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer along with shorts and pants give this one a try,1
999,Dear retailer designersjust want a nice dress that isnt made from polyester dont mind paying bigger bucks for quality fabrics but please enough of the polyester loveyour customers,0
1000,Love this top it looks just as pictured the lilac color is just as it looks which i am happy about sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online but not with this top it is soft velvet silky lining and hits right where it does on model i got a pxs my usual size i am the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up but again this is pictured well made and very pretty can dress up or down,1
1001,This top is so pretty even better in person its made really well and i love that its washable i did have some initial reservations with the fit im petite and small chested so i typically like to wear a bra to get a bit of extra help but with the way this top is cut swingy and slightly bell shaped i found that wearing a bra even one with light foam cups not even pushup was making the shape of the top look really weird once i took off the bra the top actually looked great i got,1
1002,I absolutely adore this dress the beautiful details and shape make it so much more unique and special than your typical linen dress its effortless yet still a showstopper i am a size with hourglass shape and my normal size it fits me like it was made for me its not too tight in the ribcage yet it is slimming and flattering not matronly at all the laces can be worn tied up for a more modest look or worn untied for a breezy casual a bit more sexy look i will be wearing this dress,1
1003,This dress is great it appears just as it does online its soft flowy and a thin chambray material the straps are adjustable which makes it a good fit for all women i am fuller in my hips and toosh and this dress fell beautifully over them i tried a large i normally do l or xl in retailer dresses and there was plenty of room i would have probably liked the xl more just because i prefer things oversized the dress is a midi length very breezy and airy its extremely comfortable and very fl,1
1004,Fits like a maternity top not for my age group or build,0
1005,Im with an hourglass shape i love this dress it drapes nicely the material wont be hot for summer and the color is perfect for my olive complexion,1
1006,lb dd ordered xs this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try i could not be more pleased with this decision as some of the other reviewers have said the dress is very well made the lining in particular is excellent it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging without adding bulk in the hot summer weather i typically wear more structured dresses but the lining on this dres,1
1007,I really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this dress it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on i ordered the smmed and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said are you kidding me by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look lbs heavier horrible design retailer i dont know which dress the,0
1008,Love these jeans i ordered one pair and liked them so much i ordered another right away i ordered the regularyes they are too long im for flats but look fantastic with heels i need to wear with thesethe fit is comfortable they stretch just enough to look nice and still move with you they are not binding at allthe first time i wore them i got so many compliments i even had a friend tell me she did not understand why flares were coming back because she t,1
1009,This skirt is exactly as i had hoped it would be the zipper works great the material feels nice and the liner is attached to the skirt so there is no bunching effect after the first time i wore the skirt i went out and bought more tops to go with it i highly recommend this skirt,1
1010,These are a perfect staple piece you can dress them up or down and theyre insanely comfortable even if you hold a lot of your weight in your butt and thighs like i do i feel like these pants do such a nice job of being formfitting and flattering without squeezing the life out of you i have always loved any and all retailer pants in this style because they just fit so well and last a really long time i will continue to buy these for many many years,1
1011,I like having lightweight summer pajamas and these are perfect the print is so much cuter in person and the fabric is wonderfully silky the pants themselves seemed to run a little bit small i ordered them in xs and s and ended up keeping the small overall a great purchase,1
1012,Loved loved loved the shirt butthe material was so thin,0
1013,Bought this in navy going to buy another one in a different color it fits my curves beautifully does not look boxy like other tunic sweaters i also disagree with other reviews i cannot see through it,1
1014,I love the style of this dress comfortable but chic and it feels great,1
1015,I saw this shirt and it was love at first sight i have never had so many strangers randomly compliment me until i wore this beautiful top fits great looks even better,1
1016,I trired this one and lvoed it right away the cut is flattering but the sleeves are a little long so ordering petite the red color is like a wine color very nice i also ordered green to see the color in person i am not sure which i will keep can be worn with anything really jeans pants or skirts or dresses,1
1017,I got this new dress for a work meeting and instantly received compliments it has a very unique pattern that is perfect for the office or date night it is a little long and falls below the knee but otherwise the dress fits and feels great the fabric has a nice weight so it covers any imperfections you might want to hide,1
1018,I am pleasantly surprised by this purchase i went back and forth on buyin this but ended up trying it out so glad i did it is very flattering and a very nice color it fits perfectly and i look forward to wearing it with my distressed denim and boots for fall,1
1019,Super comfortable and flattering casual jeans im lbs normally size and the fit perfect,1
1020,I will find myself reaching for this top time and time again,1
1021,I saw this suit in the store and was immediately drawn to it i did not think it was gonna work because i have boobs real ones and i was not sure it would provide enough support it is the cutest suit ever have enough support to get away with it but definitely couldnt go for a jog ha it will also look great with white jeans and double as a bodysuit,1
1022,I bought this top for my mom for christmas i wasnt sure if she would like it but it is really nice in person and she loved it it fit true to size and can be dressed down as it is on the model or dressed up i am so glad i decided to get this top highly recommend,1
1023,This is a simple design but feminine and dressy enough for a summer wedding this dress is great for hourglass shapes but it does not hide your features,1
1024,Just got the small peach in the mail love it also got the black small petite works great as this shirt is pretty long great boho tee,1
1025,I have never loved denim jackets because they always have seemed kind of basic or boring this one is edgy and the design is amazing it can be worn with anything and will go through many seasons i found the fit to be on point my normal medium fit perfectly,1
1026,This sweater was just okay i am happy to pay or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy and not the quality i expected for that price i may have kept it if it were at about half the price but it just was not worth it retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer looked great in the photos but unfortunately in person were not quality garments,0
1027,I ordered these in the blue size p i am lbs a size p and curvy the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area and i dont have skinny thighs the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe especially when paired with a dressier top blazer skinny belt and heels also i like that the jeans dont have the to,1
1028,I wear this top with jeans or cords i allways get compliments its comfortable and versatile go down a size,1
1029,I always look at jumpsuits but they never seem to work for me because of my height and petite stature i ordered the xxsp and it fits perfectly so comfortable and made of high quality silk which you can really feel is well made love that there is no zipper just a hidden elastic tube top and a hook and eye below the nape of the neck plan on wearing this for my th birthday with heels or booties and a cropped leather jacket,1
1030,This dress is stunning the quality is impeccable and the craftsmanship is stunning i ordered my typical size and it was snug but sizing up would not have worked this may be the most beautiful high quality piece ive ever seen at retailer,1
1031,Material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps bay sure wish this came in blk i bought mauve just love it,1
1032,Fyithe model is wearing the top with a cami tank under on its own its lace and has holes throughout i prefer it that way so you can layer to make it more conservative but also wear with a nude bra for an edgier look material washed well and has a pretty raw lace edge seam on the bottom,1
1033,I bought these immediately after trying them on i was totally surprised to see these very cool edgy pants at retailer the color and details are spot on great quality i wore them with a blaclk leather high platform boot and black top tucked in i received a lot of compliments these look like they should come from europe i just wish retailer would buy better quality and more interesting things like these pants,1
1034,I wanted to love this dress but it has too many flaws first the waistband falls right under the bust and the skirt flares out from there not a flattering silhouette second the fabric is a sickly yellowbeige netting that looks like burlap third i cant imagine what kind of bra you can wear under it on the plus side the fabric isnt scratchy,0
1035,What a great purchase especially on sale as this tank cant get more comfy the material is soft and great to wear during those warm weather months love it,1
1036,I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it im currently months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason,1
1037,This dress is gorgeous more ivory in person the crochet is amazing i sized up from my normal s to a m only bc i wanted a loose fit and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift i wanted a bigger size but a small would have prob worked as well depends on how you want this to fit i love it i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings soon w just sandals great transition piece bc its a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe,1
1038,I love this top on me it looks so flattering the tie detail is really nice and i love the white subtle details at the bottom and collar i actually havent seen the sleeves unrolled on me i roll them up the tie part is a little wrinkled from shipment but who cares i ordered the regular as the petite have been sold out a longtime ago i actually got this shirt a while back and thought i had already written a review i am wearing it with boyfriend jeans right now for casual friday and,1
1039,This suit is better than i expected im a large d cup and with this type of top style i typically size up im a bottom but would normally would order a large top because this type of top runs smallnot here i ordered the large and much to my suprise its too big im sending back i may order a small and medium just to be safe but the cups are definitely not cut too small here the bodice is very flattering with the black and white contrast so pretty,1
1040,I love the cut and swing of this tee the royal blue is very saturated and pretty,1
1041,Great tee for layering love the sweet lace along the bottom the lace lines the entire body of the tee and its a little thin so i prefer a cami underneath but a nude bra would be invisible i usually wear a small sometimes an xs and the small fits like it does on the model,1
1042,I love the look of this dress when its on the only issue i have with it is that the inside of the dress is white which shows through on the chest slightly but its such a pretty dress and such an overall great fit that im keeping it anyway,1
1043,I agree with the other reviewers about sizing down in this tee the colors are beautiful and design lovely i love how the sleeves are finished and the neckline i purchased at my local retailer store along with the flower days tee that i purchased in a larger size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts highly recommend both,1
1044,I really liked these pants they are so audrey hepburn i especially like how they come up high on my waist i actually bought different pairs of essential pants and kept all of them essential taper and essential slim i stated that these run small but they just seem to run smaller than the other two im and they are a touch longer than id like but that is an easy fix for reference im lbs and bought size in these and in the others,1
1045,This poncho is so comfortable fabric soft and not too hot this goes with so many things my favorite purchase this fall,1
1046,This is a beautiful casual topit is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fitthe length is perfect not too long or short the colors coordinate great with denim,1
1047,This dress is very flattering and tts i bought this dress for my brothers wedding at the end of june i love that it is machine washable which was the reason i chose this dress instead of another as another reviewer already mentioned it is brighter than photographed,1
1048,Comfortable decent quality and very casual,1
1049,Adorable comfortable im and lbs i ordered an xs it hits at my knees and is not see through the color is pinkish in person which i like more than the photo,1
1050,I bought this in xl and it fits just as shown i could size down to a l and it would still fit because there is a lot of flow to this top so if you want a more tailored but loose fit then size down but it isnt boxy and the deep v is sexy but not immodest and the pocket looks like silk but its just polyester the pleating in the back gives this movement or moveability like when you drive there isnt much pull its a thin light material and very cool for hot humid summer,1
1051,Really like this tee but i do wish it was made of another material i like the design simple with a nice macrame detail the material is a very plain with much to be desired ultimately kept the shirt but would have loved it more if it was made with something that felt better quality,1
1052,I admittedly watched this dress until it went on sale then was lucky enough to find it i couldnt find my normal size p so thought i would take a chance with the p and it fit perfectly i havent tried on the p but im guessing it would have been a bit snug the dress is comfortable and feminine and i absolutely love it i know i will wear it all summer,1
1053,Fits and lots nothing like picture very wide like a tent dress,0
1054,Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailerin the sale room it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine brightens up the drearriest of daysi did size down i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my ftin frame it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your normal size the quality is great and the style is just lovely great jacketlove love love,1
1055,I fist saw this dress in the window in alexandria va olde towne and i immediately said that i have to have it upon receiving it in the mail i was surprised by the quality of the dress this dress is made very well after trying it on it did look like i was going to be dancing with the hippies in woodstock but i love the dress and plan on wearing it soon good quality,1
1056,It might look a bit stiff from the photo but this fabric is so soft and really is a fashionable sweatshirt,1
1057,Great little black dress for cooler evenings with boots or dress down with a pair of flats for daytime perfect fall dress,1
1058,I ordered the large but it swallowed me the store happened to have a medium so i was able to make an exchange the medium fit perfect im delighted to include this in my wardrobe,1
1059,I own other cloth and stone tops and always love the softness of the material this one missed the mark not soft and very thick not what i was expecting,0
1060,As another reviewer wrote this is not the same jean featured on the website same cut and style but its a light denim wash with wiskering and worn look at the knees i called customer service to see if this was a mistake and they said there was not really a way to check it unless i exchanged them i didnt want the same wrong jeans again so i opted out too bad they are cure,0
1061,I loved the look of this dress online so i was excited to order it but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be i thought the material would be more lacy but it seemed pretty cheap there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory but it made the material poof out just under the waist making me look like i had a belly no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead which,0
1062,I have this top in the blue print and i love it im super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top while the small did fit in al other areas it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust,1
1063,I purchased a size small i usually always buy a petite but this fit me just fine since it is a vest the length in the back didnt fall too long it runs true to size its soft and i wear it with long dresses rompers short dresses skirts its a nice tapered vest im d and its fine,1
1064,This is much cuter in person than in the picture in person i am much more aware that it is also a lower length in the back and it flairs just a little so that the design really stands out i bought in the white and blue dots and can see wearing it in the now spring and even summer it is just a tad tight in my size so i went up to a thank you retailer this will be timeless,1
1065,I bought this dress during the retailer weekend and im so happy i did this is a very wellmade welldesigned dress that is quite figure flattering the marriage of artsy and colorful on a neutral background makes sense and the combination of colors and the style of the dress work well together the wearer will definitely have several options for footwear pairings this dress is as fun and playful as it is classy i cant wait for an occasion to wear this dress,1
1066,This sweater is very pretty the pictures online do not show the intricate knitting and the lovely details or how delicate the yarn is i bought the light orange color and i think it will transition nicely into spring the shape is very figure flattering as well overall i am very happy with my purchase,1
1067,More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past they are right on in their estimation of the product in the case of this dressif it had not been for the reveiwsi doubt i would have even tried this the dress is beautifully made lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality it is lined in the solid periwinklecolored fabric that matches the outer fabric print tts and very formfitting falls just above the knee and does not rid,1
1068,The wash is just as pictured and the fit is great i actually got a when i usually wear a but when i wear a belt with them they hug the waist perfectly im always on the search from length however these jeans are a and still look excellent if i roll them up once,1
1069,Thank goodness chinos are in this year i was so excited when i saw these pants and they did not disappoint when i put them on the material is so soft with a decent amount of stretch in them making them incredibly comfy they fit true to size and are very flattering not too baggy or frumpy looking i purchased the rose colored pants which are basically a light nantucket red color for reference i am and lbs and bought a size id be very surprised if i dont end up purchas,1
1070,I purchased this dress in the berry color it is beautiful and feminine the length fit just like in the picture i love all the detail and ease of this dress im d and purchased a size it fits true to size,1
1071,Out of stock so quickly in my size please restock,1
1072,This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering i especially like the generous necklineadds a uniqueness to it great shirt for dressing down but still feeling feminine i bought two my husband always compliments me when i wear it,1
1073,I absolutely love this dress its great for business casual its also such a great color for the transition into fall,1
1074,Will be cute in the summer months and with a pair of sweater tights will work for holiday parties doesnt seem to come in a petite which is a bummer so i sized down,1
1075,Cute casual drawstring short runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look nice length for long legs,1
1076,Then this one is for you so disappointed upon receipt of this skirt as i had been eyeing it for a while and was excited to see it on sale based upon the pictures i thought the black stitching was just an interesting outline detail but it is actually masking this skirts ugly secret a pouch yes it literally has a pouch smack dab in the middle of your abdomen which does not lay flat the material also looks rather snag prone and already had a few pulls in spots this one,0
1077,This ia a long boiled wool vest with some spandex in it it is very soft and cozy i went with the ml cause i preferred the longer length even though i also fit in the xss i have worn it many times and my favorite way to wear it is with skinny jeans tucked into cowboy boots paired with a black lace top and a cool necklace when i am hanging out at home in yoga pants and slippers i throw it on when i get coldits like a cozy hug i highly recommend,1
1078,If you are over this top probably is not for you it is absolutely seethru great style and beautiful light fabric but you can see right thru it,0
1079,I love this skirt it is unique and flattering clothes like this skirt that brought me to retailer in the first place as the first reviewer said this is a wellmade striking skirt it is tts i usually wear a size and the size fit perfectly i am and lbs the skirt is lined and is very comfortable to wear,1
1080,I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it i love the darker color more modern day less s it runs a little small i am always either a s or xs at retailer lately their clothes seem to be running a little bigger so i have been an xs in most tops when i order online i never know which size to get i ordered an xs however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up so i returned it for a s and it fits great i was,1
1081,This dress is beautiful and i received so many compliments its form fitting but comfortable it is just the right mix of classy and sexy you can easily dress it up for a formal occasion or keep it simple i am lb with an athletic build and a size fit perfectly i will be wearing this dress for years to come,1
1082,This was long on me im but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist very soft material this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather didnt seem too seethrough,1
1083,This dress is really beautiful i plan on wearing it to my nephews wedding in april my only complaint would be is that it runs extremely small i am feet tall and pounds slim build and normally wear a p or p i ended up with the p and it fits perfectly my advice to anyone considering purchasing is to order several different sizes and return the ones that dont fit,1
1084,I love this tunic i wore it with black leggings and boots it is well made and flowy i wish it came in more colors,1
1085,As another review said the models pose doesnt do this dress justice and i cant believe this is on sale i picked this up this weekend at my local store it fits wonderfully very flattering the fabric feels good and im fairly certain wont wrinkle too easily which is going to make this the perfect dress for packing for a trip dress it up with boots for dinner dress it down with sandals for day this is a steal get it im the size fit perfect,1
1086,I really love cloth stone and this top did not disappoint i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly it has a nice drape to it and is super soft i will add that when looking at the picture i didnt notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid however there is a really light pink to it as well i actually w,1
1087,Im approximate size of model pictured however this dress is at least in shorter on me the fabric is a bit thin and the vneck is quite deepbut i happily wore it on the beaches of puerto rico added a jean jacket and epice scarf and wore it in paris last week i wore it belted as i saw a sales associate in antro do with an open weave sweater and flipflops on a warm boston day dont count it out yet it really is a chameleon piece that you can wear so many ways,1
1088,I agree with the other review the fabric and pattern are adorable and well made the fabric is not sheer at all and great qualityhowever the shirt is very wide i am a and the small is way too big the arm holes are perfect but the bottom is uncomfortably large and awkward in appearance,0
1089,I cant believe this top hasnt sold out it is a great casual top that will go well with anything i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps i did size up to a large but it didnt get huge around the midsection i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim,1
1090,This dress fits perfectly the cut is so flattering i am tall but the length is great not too short,1
1091,So soft this is the best basic tee ive bought in a long time and it fits so nicely on my frame im ans lb medium bust and got an xs,1
1092,What a find this skirt is so soft and fits like a dream perfect shape and length ive been looking for more pieces to match a couple of fabulous pairs of purple shoes i have so this is just the ticket,1
1093,This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on fit perfectly as a size should in the arms shoulder chest then the waist was huge just hung off of me like a flour sack it was wider than the chest measurements which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic combine that with the highlow hemline and it looked like a project runway reject sent back immediately do not buy this if you have or want to appear to have an hourglass figure it will do nothing for,0
1094,I absolutely love these shorts everything about them is perfect i have them in almost every color they wash beautifully i dont dry my shorts in the dryer they fit the same as last years im thin pretty straight with little hips i wear them in a size i tried the they felt a little snug i dont like my shorts tight i like when they can hang down a little with a belt or not like the model in the picture i dont find that they stretch out much after wearing but that coul,1
1095,Tried it on in store its more of a cornflower blue instead of a true navy if you zoom in youll also notice theres a pattern to it i think it gives it a little something extra i may put gold buttons on it as the plain black buttons are a little boring didnt buy it right away and came back with a survey coupon and it was out of stock had them order and freeship it to me from the store fit is nice and relaxed i like how it goes up in the back so it pairs well with dresses and,1
1096,Got the flower print and it is really a nice top covers the butt i normally need a xl but in this top i got a large,1
1097,This is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline the beading is lovely and mine was intact i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect b the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater love it,1
1098,This is an ideal top especially for summer so lightweight and soft the detailing is adorable and makes this simple shirt feel very special yet everyday i ordered the black and am back for the other colors this one is an absolute win,1
1099,This dress is flattering in all the right places it has a gorgeous skirt with a comfortable formfitting top it provides just the right amount of coverage i love it so much i bought it in two colors,1
1100,Stunning beautiful elegant comfortable and all silk the print is very mesmerizing as are all the hemant nandita pieces i own im shocked that there arent more reviews i found this fit perfectly on my body skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate i am and purchased size mp please retailer offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site,1
1101,Loved my mustard colored ones so much i also bought the ligher green color fit is wonderful and very flattering they can be dressed up or down they look great with heals or booties,1
1102,I loved this color and ordered it online because i thought it would work for both casual and work days dressed up a little ummmmm no its weird and boxy and does not look at all like it does on the model i think maybe if you have no bust whatsoever and size way down it would look okay im only a b weigh pounds and it made me look huge and awkward this is going back,0
1103,Love love love this jacket great spring and fall weather very stylish,1
1104,I received this skirt today and am absolutely thrilled as a short and curvy lady i feel most comfortable in fuller skirts but not too poofy and this one lies perfectly does not make my hips look wide the colors are soft and very feminine which also suits my style it may seem like a springtime skirt but i will start wearing it with tights and a sweater right away,1
1105,This print is so cool the shirt is just a little loose so order your usual size and it will fit perfectly,1
1106,I thought it would be heavier than it is its thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater it contains wool so not really suitable for springsummer its also shorter than it appears on the model and a little widerboxier too,0
1107,Love the crushed velvet and tried it on in the regular sizing in blue but really needed the petite although i tried on the xs in the regular sizing i was afraid id need my normal sp so i ordered that instead of the xsp should have stuck with the xsp and will be exchanging it for that size it definitely is dress length but dowdy dress length in the regular for me at and the petite sizing is not all that much shorter but enough to be cute expecting a lot of use especially over the,1
1108,I love this top i originally bought the brownpurple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it the fabric is really soft and breezy perfect for the spring to summer weather the sleeves are a little long on me but doesnt bother me it runs a little large but works with my style i would have sized down but it wouldnt have fit in the bust im a d i definitely recommend this top,1
1109,I ordered the blue in size it ran at least two if not three sizes too small compared to my other retailer blouses it was too small through the body other than the peplum the arms were tight too the waistline and length matched the online photos its widening the material they chose was also scratchy and rough especially around the neckline i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work the blue color was gorgeous though the patterned lace w,0
1110,Based on the other reviews i sized down from my usual p to a p but this dress was still ridiculously huge and extremely unflattering i could tell the minute i took it out of the package it wouldnt work i cant imagine this would flatter very many people the front photo of the model is incredibly deceptive very disappointedthis will be going back for sure,0
1111,I love this denim jacket its just a basic light denim jacket with a casual preworn soft feel i like how its slightly cropped i think it runs fairly truetosize possibly a little on the small side i am lbs and c and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit if i had wanted the fit shown on the model i would have ordered a small but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser i love it,1
1112,I purchased this vest in the store the colors vary depending on where it is sewn i purchased one with black around the middle and more black around the collar it was more flattering the fit and design are lovely its fuzzy but since i dont have any fur in my wardrobe this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me i highly recommend it even for the price,1
1113,I bought this shirt because i needed something lighter to where in autumn and needed to layer i wasnt expecting so much out of a tshirt the material is great its comfy and oh so flattering on any figure i ordered the green one and it was greener in person than online but a very lovely color it layers great and is longer than expected almost dress length im not a tights wearer but it would definitely go great with tights or leggings and it worked fabulously under a wrap great prod,1
1114,The fabric has a smooth feel and the shape is perfect over skinny jeans i like the yoked v neckline a different take on the usual buttons of a popover i wear a white cami under it from retailer to bring up the depth just a little great with blue jeans white jeans and shorts i bought this shirt in red size im lbs,1
1115,This is so amazing the dress is solid and will go under many different jackets kimonos and sweaters,1
1116,This dress is great its the perfect transition piece from summer to fall it is very comfortable the material and fit are similar to an oversized sweatshirt overall i love it,1
1117,I love this dress its so comfortable and perfect for the summer fall transition it fits true to size and isnt to boxy or tight i love the colors as well,1
1118,Fits perfectly and is quite adorable too keep in mind is that where its cut off on the leg is a bit awkward if youre not wearing heels,1
1119,So after reading the reviews decided to just order my usual size thinking they might be a tad snug wrong they were huge i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size by mistake unfortunately small sizes sold out quality is excellent as well as style so bummed,0
1120,I would not have tried this on or ordered it by myself but my stylist brought it over for me to try as it was on promotion well ok i get it i actually liked it on but the regular size was too big in the arm hole thinking of it i should have ordered the xxs maybe i willflattering style comfrotable fabric really nice overall,1
1121,I tried this on in store in a small and then ordered the medium online i loved it so much i generally run a smallmedium with retailer so i thought this was pretty true to size im also longer through the torso so the medium is better for me to cover my stomach when tied it is on the thinner side but not see through perfect for layering and for a mild california winter cant wait for it to come,1
1122,I ordered this for the colors and modern geometric design colors are as shown a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans and my burgundy flats its casual and soft enough to wear all day i wore it to the beach then out to dinner the same evening oh i spilled red wine on it at the beach and couldnt wash it until the next day i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out completely i air dried and,1
1123,I love this cardigan i purchased it in the cream color however it did fray a bit after washing it other than that i think it was a great buy though,1
1124,I love these pants purchased them in white the fit is great the fabric is just the right thickness given they are white i dont want the fabric to be too thin a bit long so i will have to have them tailored but vey happy with these pants,1
1125,Could not say enough great things about this jacket nice quality and drape and such a wearable comfortable option as opposed to a more structured blazer nice true to size fit petite small was perfect on my lbs framenot too tight and not baggy sleeves still will order an petite xs for my daughter too retailer i would definitely buy other colors if you decide to order them,1
1126,I had only planned to check out this dress at the store but ended up buying it then and there not a deal breaker but there were extra threads hanging from some parts of the dress it made me a bit concern that the stitching would unravel during wear so far so good i wish they had paid more attention to little details like that,1
1127,For me this looked better in the picture i found the actual item more garish in person and way too scratchy on the outside for my liking hard pass for this petite,0
1128,Love love this skirt quality is great and so comfortable you can even do this skirt with boots and sweater in colder months so glad i got it,1
1129,Love the soft fabric and easy fit of this dress im pleased that it does give a hint of ones figure and doesnt just hang like a sack i found the blue to be most flattering and was playing with styling at home and found that the wider retailer tabby leather belt gave it a whole new look,1
1130,So sure from the online shop images that i ordered two pairs the package arrived in less than days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer i love them this look works both daytime as well as evening its geared to work with any casual to couture look my year old niece wanted to buy the second pair sz from me so i gave them to her shes a nice niece,1
1131,Loved how this draped and im super petite b bust and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned i purchased the pxs and it was huge i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest too sad retailer please get the fit right,0
1132,Love the look of these casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them they are so comfortable edgy but relaxed joggers with a leather look what more could you ask for,1
1133,This is one of the most flattering tops ive ever owned im a little confused by the other reviews because the model in the photo doesnt have it tacked in the back you can see on the photo of the back theres a button to pull it in which makes it so incredibly flattering its soft and beautiful but very delicate id wash it separately and carefully and rarely i actually had to return my first one because of a hole in the material overall one of my new favorite tops,1
1134,I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did i usually wear a and the fit great it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events i have a long torso and dont find it too short at all it is a tad tight across the shoulders so if you are broad in that area it might not work for you overall love,1
1135,This blouse makes me feel young vibrant and beautiful i got it in colors with the coupon special i love how it fits and its slimming love it i have broad shoulders and it is very slimming,1
1136,Sometimes you have those days where you feel overweight and unattractive this shirt is perfect for that it has a chic cut and it doesnt look like you are having an off day at all so cute and i really like the length as well i usually wait until items go on sale but this i had to buy right away,1

1138,I thought this blouse ran a bit largeswinging wide at the hips it does bunch in the bust area if you are larger a correct undergarment fixed this problem i am a ddd and thought the size was perfect,1
1139,Received today the fit is true to size quality fabric beautiful color will go with so many things,1
1140,I love this top i got a medium in black on sale i am and lbs the medium fits great the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy which is nice in my experience it is not too constraining contrary to other reviews however i think it depends on your body shape i am a cokebottle this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out note it is too lowcut for work wear very happy with my purchase,1
1141,The dress ran big but is tight at the bust material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off you cant see the ruffle flounce that runs the bottom of the dress,0
1142,Great pants i love the style and fit would highly recommend,1
1143,I saw a sales associate sa wearing it at my local retailer and totally loved it this tshirt runs very large so it depends on how one wants to wear it the sa wore it oversized and tied to the side super cute i tried on a regular small and it was still sizes too big and too long on me i ordered the xs petite and it fits perfectly not too fitted and not too loose im b waist hips my mother was a great embroider and the giddy up embroidery work at the neckline and the,1
1144,I am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit however the petite looks great and the length is perfect it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose i am and lbs this will be my go to for fall looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater,1

1147,This top is a great addition to my summer wardrobe i love it because it does not cling to my body and in a hot humid summer i want things that flow this is super cute and flattering the lace in the back is soft and not too revealing,1
1148,I actually saw this dress on an associate and didnt like it but as i was trying on other things i saw my size hanging on a rack in the dressing room and thought why not just try it glad i did it is so flattering on and you can dress it up or down its so versatile i received so many compliments when i wore this glad i gave it a try,1
1149,Very cute and flattering but id order at least one size down im usually a and just during the time i tried on the s in the store i could tell theyd loosen up enough for a ill review more once i have them had to order since they dont typically have s in store so cant comment on quality as of yet,1
1150,Im and pounds and i ordered the petite the jeans are fabulousflatteringcomfortablei could go on and on the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places it is a nice flare bottom i will have to wear these with heels or wedges they are too long for flats,1

1152,This is so comfortable and so flattering i got it in two colors i think it runs tts i sized up so i could wear it lower on my hips im and got the regular size rather than petite and its more of a maxi skirt on meway longer than on the model this is what i wanted i can never find maxi skirts that arent way too long even when i try petite but if you want it more midi go for petite sizing,1
1153,I am loving these they are quite long but are prefect to wear with pj shorts or leggings very soft and cozy,1
1154,Love that it is light and very comfortable i got both colors the only thing is its dry clean only love that i got it on sale,1
1155,Ordered this jacket in the holly color thinking it would be brown per the photo but when it arrived it was more olive green it is a beautiful wellmade jacket but i already have two olive green jacketsdont need a third if they bring this jacket out in brown i will definitely order i order the xs and it fit perfectly,1
1156,This is a must have way cuter in person love the look and feel it runs large so size down its more cream than white,1
1157,Bought these shorts in the store in navy and loved them so much that i ordered them in the taupe for some reason the taupe pair is shorter but they still fit beautifully the fabric is ligher weight than denim so i wear them a lot love pilcro,1
1158,I have been searching for months to find a pair of topquality slim fit highwaisted jeans either straight leg or flare my search has ended with these flare jeans from paige thanks to retailer the fabric is incredibly soft yet has that little snap of stretchiness we have all come to expect in expensive jeans i also like the dark wash and the fact that there arent those odd color striations across the hips i bought size which fits me perfectly virtually all my other jeans a,1
1159,I am an retailer employee and this top just screamed my name when it arrived in our store i love the colors and the feminine flair of this top i am short and this top is a little longer on me than pictured on the model i like the fact that it is a bit longer it helps cover up some of my extra assets the top is to big at the arm holes which is the story i have heard from my customers who did not purchase the top even though they loved it i should have purchased the xxs online it would,1
1160,I bought this dress because i thought it would look good on her and it does,1
1161,I am five four and one hundred and twenty pounds and the small fits me perfectly with enough room in the arms and chest i am a c the red is gorgeous and sweet got it on line sale and worth it,1
1162,I ordered the black and white and the pattern is just as pictured so cute but after reading the other reviews i ordered a size up and im glad i did the m would have been snug but the skirt in the l fit me as pictured on the model i am i b cup and the top was snug but not unflatteringly so on me its still a dress i can wear to work and even wear a tank underneath if i wanted to overall im incredibly happy with this one im fairly straight though so i can see how this might be,1
1163,These have a great fit design i ordered a size larger after reading that this style runs on the small size typically im a but ordered a the wash has a great vintage feel about it i also love that these do not lose their shape after wearing all day,1
1164,I ordered this in size xl in ivory it was a drab poorlymade toosmall sweater the knit material wasnt good quality and the overall fit didnt work i liked the light red color and maybe if that had been in stock then i would have overlooked the problems but there are better ivory retailer cardigans available this was returned,0

1167,Very nice casual corduroy skirt for the fall it sits nicely at the waist and the asymmetrical cut gives it some visual interest it has a slightly aline shape and the side seams round up a couple of inches i took a point off for it not being lined and the closure relies on the zipper alone instead of having a hook along with the zipper i took my usual small and like how it fits my only concern is that it is a little on the short side for me but since its a fall skirt and will always be wo,1
1168,I got this dress in green and it looks better in person than it even does in the online picture the fabric is soft and flattering i am pear shaped so a lot of things dont look good around my waist but this worked beautifully the only thing is that i cant get the slight wrinkles out of the bottom i washed it and lined dried it and some still show the care says not to iron a steamer would probably work well on this the slight wrinkles are not an issue for me though well worth it and a g,1
1169,Absolutely fantastic top the cut is very flattering and the colors are gorgeous in the pattern i also bought the white,1
1170,Anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down i have to buy it fit is always so flattering comfy and the prints are always great,1
1171,I literally bought this dress days ago and now it is listed as no longer available on the retailer site i am a size with about a bc bust the thing i love about this dress is that it looks really nice without a bra i was really surprised at how well constructed it was,1
1172,Beautiful dusty rose color the fit is fabulous love the sleeve and hem length very flattering and does not cling,1
1173,Ive had my eye on this poncho for weeks and finally scored the olive green one over thanksgivingblack friday special i would say the color is more mustard yellow which will go well with a variety of jeweltone tops etc the poncho is a nice weight but not too heavy i am with short arms but i went ahead and bought the regular xs instead of the petite sizes and the length is perfect i am seriously considering getting the cranberry one as well a classic buy for winter which im sure,1
1174,The fairisle details are gorgeous and the wool is thick but not itchy the neckline is a perfect crew cut style not too tight but compliments the neck itself the stitching has a lot of beautiful neutral colors so you can wear this with jeans blue or gray cords etc so many options,1
1175,Very feminine and romantic blouse i love it it runs small as other reviewer said i had to go size up as i want to wear a cami under it the fabric is soft and sheer the design emphasizes the nature curve of a womans body in a good way back is longer than the front part if you like romantic floral prints and soft fabric this one is a winner,1
1176,First of all im not a navy person at all i much prefer black or other bright colors i received an email showing this trench last saturday and i pulled it up online and noticed how darling it looked i didnt order it but i went back the following day to check it out again it was nowhere on the website then a few days ago back it popped up online again i noticed it wasnt in my local store so i thought id go in and look this weekend i just had to see it i actually made it to the st,1
1177,These leggings were everything i expected them to be they are well made and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year the pattern on the website is accurate and the waistband is comfortable and flattering would definitely buy again,1
1178,So nice to switch it up from all my black and gray sweats these are luxuriously soft and so so comfortable they are light weight and beautiful i am and i am very happy with the size xs i purchased was deciding between xs and s and i am happy i went with the xs worth every penny you wont regret also finally perfect length,1
1179,This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person a nice mix of modern and artistic with just enough color and a flattering fit my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day especially at the neckline if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin i would recommend it for style and fit,1
1180,Pilcro stet roll ups are my fave i have about or pairs and i needed a replacement for my light wash so i went in the store and tried these on wow has the quality changed the denim is a lot lighter in material now the wash isnt as real almost like im wearing jegging shorts these were my favorite but now ill have to look for light wash denim shorts elsewhere because these new ones just wont cut it anymore why pilcro the sizing is about the same they run a little large due to the,0

1182,Love these the colors are perfect for fall originally ordered a small which fit fine im a but felt the black color would look better if i sized up and the material wasnt as stretched im glad i exchanged for a medium for that reason,1
1183,I was sorry to miss the original offering of this dress when it went on sale so i jumped and ordered the graybluegreenblack stripes when offered i purchase almost all of my retailer clothes online the dresses i am interested in are not generally offered in my local store so there is always that moment of truth when i get to find out if something i fell in love with actually works for me as everyone else has said this dress is fabulous i got my usual size i am small busted and,1
1184,What a delight of a dress i saw it online and it piqued my interest in person too with only one size available i was limited to try on a dress two sizes too small so ive factored that in to my review the dress is very light and would be see through without the attached slip the length fell just above my ankle with the design allowing for a movement and flow to the bottom the colors are vibrant in person perhaps even more so than online the fit seems to be true to size though i have to,1
1185,I love this shirt i would recommend an undershirt,1
1186,Fits well soft and comfortable,1
1187,I love these jeans i really like the way they fit and havent had problems with them stretching out like other reviewers have,1
1188,I absolutely love this dress the fabric is very light and airy while not being revealing the color being nude as indicated is a nice change from plain white or off white and the embroidery is just beautiful and makes this dress quite unique i love the fact that it is a tunic dress which lends to less of a structured look and more of an easy casual style i recently wore this dress to an out door bbq and was both cool and comfortable all day i also received many compliments from friends and,1
1189,Beautiful colors and silhouette i got the navy the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk ive gotten a ton of compliments on it im and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee and the low hem falls to my ankles,1
1190,Absolutely love this top it falls perfect in all the right places ive gotten so many compliments especially from the bow design on the back,1
1191,These shorts were just what i expected from retailer they are more pretty in person particularly for the color like a rich clay color not garish orange very good quality fabric the embroidery around the edges is unique im usually a size small in bottoms from retailer the s fits perfectly,1
1192,I wasnt going to purchase this dress because it was given star however i ordered it and i was so glad i did im lbs this dress fit me perfectly it really compliment my petite body i get so much compliments it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much,1
1193,The design is loose and forgiving and it is very comfortable the fabric is soft and light weight and i love how the sleeves are full cut so even those without stick arms can fit in them it drapes beautifully and is quite lovely on you can easily dress it up with jewelry or wear it over jeans for a great goto top on the weekend i also bought the purple version it says its mauve in the description but its really more of a pale lavender color still very pretty but i wish it was mauve,1
1194,This top is lovely and flowy it fits true to size and the lace detail at the neck is perfect to make this top stand out i felt like it was a little sheer but it wasnt problematic enough for me to take away a star,1
1195,I am usually an xs but ordered an xxs in this because it looked like it ran large glad i did its still roomy but doesnt look too big could be a swim coverup or would look cute with jeans very pleased,1
1196,I bought this lovely silkvelvet shirt in the quotskyquot color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue which disappointed me it is definitely darker than appears in photo still a luxurious wellmade beauty with sassy appeal it drapes like a snake slithering down your body it comes with attitude,1
1197,I love this top i typically wear a size small and this is very true to size its loose fitting but does not make you look large the pattern on the material is also fun without being too busy perfect for fall,1
1198,Ive been looking for the right leggings that are of good quality thick enough to feel appropriately covered and a good price point these are those leggings need more,1
1199,This dress is so pretty the tulle underskirt was a fun surprise and the subtle striping in the dress so classy the dress is true to size my main concern was making sure the top part would fit around my chest it fits perfectly,1
1200,Its not often you can find a dress that is warm cozy timeless and sexy at the same time but this one is it the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places i normally wear an xs or s and in this i took an xs sleeves are nice and long your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be depending on how low you fold over the collar piece i chose to tack mine down in place so im not always adjusting iti wore this dress with black heeled overtheknee boots,1
1201,Obsessed with this sweatshirt its a must have for any loungewear lover im normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose relaxed look i was afraid it would swallow me but i love the fit the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute the fabric is a great texture great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans worth every penny,1
1202,I think this top works best for a petite person i am and lbs the xs is perfect for me i love it so much i purchased it in more colors i machine washed and line dried it washed beautifully,1

1204,Lightweight soft cotton top and shorts i think its meant to be a beach coverup but im wearing it as a thin lightweight summer outfit on these hot hot days the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didnt realize when i ordered it but i like it and it matches the look in the photos and the shorts are very lowcut dont expect them up around your waist again i like that some might want to wear a cami underneath because its a thin cotton but im fine asis i bought it i,1
1205,This tunic is overall very pretty with soft material and very comfy not itching the color is more like a taupe than whats shown on picture i love it very much as the design is unique romantic but also classic it goes well with skinny jeans or black leggings,1
1206,I love this shirt its gorgeous got it last night wore it today and received compliments all day longi dont normally look good in tunic length tops but somehow theres magic in this one the seaming on the front totally hides my postbaby pooch too bad the baby just turned and my pooch isnt going anywhere adore,1

1208,Chambray top that is soft but thickheavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on untucked the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back it hangs like a tunic almost aline so do not size up or you will have too much material i am a sz small in most retailer clothing and the sz fit nicely sz was too loose around my arms and the sz was too tight around my chest nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back,1
1209,I decided to order this on a whim during the promotion on tops why because it looked decent and i like the other tops from the same brand i am so glad i did it is even better in personcolor nice ivory with subtle speckle in it very neutral in color but also on the warmer side the fabric is a little sheer you could definitely see my bright colored bra but a nude one will do the trickthe length was a little longer and the sleeves were a bit long too doesnt come in peite bu,1

1212,If you have anything larger than an a cup this shirt will likely not fit right it is very pretty but the seem on the front runs directly in the middle of the chest it literally runs right through the center of the breasts what were they thinking if it had been three inches higher or lower it would have been perfect for reference im approximately lb and have a dd cup,0
1213,This is a great long sleeve casual shirt for spring soft and airy pairs well with jeans i found that it fit me just right im not very tall but my shoulders are a little broad for my height which typically puts me in the smallmedium range so i got size regular this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel my only problem is there aren,1

1216,I try to find something to like about everything i buy even if it turns out to be a disappointment for me the neckline of this shirt is absolutely beautiful and super flattering it was one of the only things that made me want to keep the shirt but unfortunately it was not enough this shirt is super boxy and runs large i would recommend sizing down for those who want to try this if you have a larger chest it might be worth ordering your regular size so that the buttons wont pull at the ch,0
1217,This beauty arrived in my store todayand despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests i just had to have this one ive always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vestbut im curvy and always feel like those add bulk this one only has sherpa on one side the softest most cozy sherpa ever and its not too bulky the print is even better than it appears onlinein fact the vest almost appears pink online and its not in person there is much more variation in color in person i adore,1

1226,I love these shorts i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt they are so comfortable and the length is perfect i love that they are loose around the thigh so they dont ride up while walking i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide i wish they had black army green and a dark wine i would be in heaven i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy,1
1227,I really love this top fits true to size romantic lace detail also love the white underlay panel for contrast extremely comfortable soft fabric so many ways to dress this top up or down,1
1228,This top is comfortable and yet with some stylish detail the fabric is soft and the lilac color looks great it hangs loose but with a nice drape at the sale price it is not to be missed,1

1232,Hard to find longer shorts that i like these are really cute i thought from the pictures that the backside would be faded and lighter which i wasnt thrilled about but willing to order and give a try great to discover this is not the case nice regular color on back and no fading really cute shorts,1
1233,A little long but very comfortable ive worn it to work and to a bridal shower so very versatile,1
1234,Bought these a week ago at full price to take on vacation love them i see they are now price if they came in a different color would get a second pair,1
1235,This blouse is very flattering it drapes well and i love the textures only problem is the head hole is a little small so if you buy the white one put your makeup on after you have it on and remove your makeup before sliding it off i bought an extra small even though im usually a small lovely top a lot of people have commented on it,1
1236,I was specifically looking for a nice pair of highwaisted jeans and this pair fit the bill i am a little unsure about the unfinished hem hence the rating on design i would have preferred a finished hem i am and they are a tad shorter than i normally like to wear my jeans i have had them for a couple of days still deciding whether to keep them despite the fact that i really love them other than these two issues,1
1237,This shirt is very swingy but true to size when i tried to size down the shoulders were too tight the green color has great texture,1
1238,Heavy in weight but not uncomfortable to wear because its fully lined and has an easy fit that skims without looking like a potato sack fits a little large but mainly tts if youre between sizes then i would size down unless youre very blessed from the waist down i am a ml on top and sm on bottom and bought the medium its a relaxed dress like a shift suppose to be that i can wear a turtleneck under without feeling stuffed,1

1240,Love polkadots love sparkle these little socks are perfect for booties,1
1241,In the photo this looks like a heavy knit top but its not the fabric is very light thin and soft its like a knit nightgown material i said this runs big b ecause im normally a size xl and i can wear this it actually fits me a little less flowy than on the model and i think looks better so to me you can size down if you want this not to have so much flowing fabricthe front crisscrosses over and it will stay together at the top area with movement the two fabric pieces sort of,1
1242,I love this dressit is so cutei have another dress from the same brand hutch in almost the exact same shapestyle so i was excited to see this one is so similar to the other dress i lovei am ft in and lbs and medium fits perfectlyits snug at the top but not tight and the skirt is full but not too fullthe fabric is slightly thinner than i expected but still like it a lot if i could change one thing it would be one inch longerhits a tiny bit more above the knee than i t,1
1243,These pants are so cute and flattering the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good i typically wear a p but they were sold out in the gray color so i tried the p and they fit perfectly this tells me that they run just a little big at least in the petite sizing i wish the rose color was available in petite i am considering ordering the chocolate as well,1
1244,I was so excited to try these its hard to find cute bermuda shorts the legs were so wide my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts they dont look that wide in the picture i am and lbs i bought my regular size but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes unrolled they came to my knee,0

1248,I saw this dress online and blined it to the store to try on it is a beautifully made dress lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket feels very boho and chic i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress i was almost turned off by the price but decided to see it in person worth every penny wear it with sandals or tall boots could have worn a medium but a little tight for c on top,1
1249,Im going through a blouse phase and this was exactly what i wanted im not svelte and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner but this one is perfect it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcageshort torso so flowy is a tough one for me,1
1250,These fit me really well i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist usually if it fits my legs the waist is too big the trousers have some stretch for a better fit the only downside is that i had go them hemmed bought regular size,1

1260,Looks much nicer in the photo i expected a much higher quality fabric this fabric truly felt cheap i expected a nicer dress for the price the fit was unflattering on me sent it back,0
1261,I was worried this skirt might look too much like a bedspread but it is so gorgeous on and the cut is so flattering i ordered a petite small and it fits perfectly great fallwinter skirt,1
1262,I followed the other reviews and sized down normally im a smallmedium in retailer for clarification and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didnt have to pay rent on the romper given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it oddly the armholes were normal sized i returned this mess,0
1263,I bought this lightweight duster in the cream color it runs a little large through the shoulders so i sized down from my usual l to a size m its very flattering on and made with natural fibers such as cotton and linen i wear this unbuttoned with a tank top cropped jeans and sandals,1
1264,I tried the xs in store and waistband is very stretchy and the material is lightweight feels delicate and to the floor fell in love with the watercolor print this would be great as a quick cover up over a bikini beware if you plan on wearing this anywhere besides by the beach make sure to rock your nude undies because the cream color is super seethru which is my least favorite part of this piece i couldnt get to the petites sizes before they all sold out so im crossing my fingers th,1

1268,Unlike the other reviews i love this skirt the lining is a nice stretchy material as is the eyelet overlay making it a really easy to wear and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional i bought it so that its slim fitting more like a pencil skirt ive only worn it to work dressed up with boots but suspect ill get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt i highly recommend it and think its a great price it is longer than on the mode,1
1269,Ive been wearing this very comfortable and cute coat for weeks it is already tearing at the seams somehow the quality of this is very poor,0

1282,I have countless ag jeans but this has become my current favorite i love cuffed jeans and actually ordered the two washes for this style the lighter one which is getting rave reviews i actually returned because of too much distressing and stretch i like this darkly uniform shade slimming and more office appropriate for casual fridays you need to size up on your usual ag size however to get the perfect fit,1
1283,Absolutely beautiful quality is worth iti agree with other review and also sized down from large to medium for a more fitted look the color is gorgeouslighter shade of brownso thrilled material does not contain dreaded wool lol,1

1289,I knew once i saw this online that i would love it because of that i almost feel like my review is biased i have been searching for a jacket like this for awhile i own the holding horses version from a few years back but that one is just not fitted enough in the waist for me even though it has a drawstring waist this one too has an interior drawstring waist and it is more fitted in the waist giving the feminine appearance i desire but its not too tight i am small up top b but larger,1
1290,I bought the shirt in ivory and went down a size per the advice from other reviewers what i should have done was go down sizes runs huge my husband said i looked pregnant and thats never a good look if your not sent this back the same day,0
1291,Ok so the shirt is dry clean only however i like it so much that im not going to knock out a star in the rating the quality is really nice and it was not too short for me i could reach up without worrying my stomach would be exposed im c and lbs and the size was perfect wonderful for work and also great with jeans i know its a little pricy but its cute and unique plus right now its cheaper,1
1292,I ordered this style in the blue red yellow and white for the sale price they all fit true to size matching the models photos but the quality is poor the hems are frayed they wrinkle easily theyre just a mess the models photos show a messy look so you know what youre getting the positives are the colors the blue is especially gorgeous the yellow is like a spicy mustard shade they are all comfortable just sloppy looking the sale price matches the quality they do stretch out t,0
1293,I hoped i would hate these because i have a zillion pairs of jeans as i suspected theyre amazing and quickly became my favorite they have just the right amount of stretch so flattering,1
1294,What a dress the print the feel of the fabric and the overall fit of this dress it definitely has the wow factor i plan on wearing this dress to the kentucky oaks this year i typically wear a and sometimes a in retailer dresses im lbs dd and took a in this i could probably even try the it fit a bit tight in the bodice for me but im not sure if it warranted a size up it is pricey but i see this being a closet staple and one of my favorite maxis yet,1
1295,This was such a nice surprise its way more sweatshirt than i thought and maybe a touch bigger than i thought but its super cute and comfortable ive worn it a bunch of times already,1
1296,I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model overall i would of kept it if it were much less money for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style,0
1297,I love this robe it is my new favorite for lounging around the house,1
1298,I love this top it fits perfect and is of great quality i ordered the pink and love it so much im getting the navy one colors are so trendy as well this top is so much cuter in person hard to tell the detail online definitely recommend to others,1
1299,I was not sure how this would work on my short stature but it is truly cute the color is a lovely cranberry red and the weight is light and versatile this piece can be worn layered in fall and winter but also with crops or shorts and a tee in the spring and summer,1
1300,Im an xl in retailer blouses and this blouse is the same im guessing women with a thin frame might size down but i cant say for sure i purchased the white blouse with the floral pattern there is a narrow band on the bottom but it isnt tight so i didnt find it to be a problem i usually dont like blouses with banded bottoms but this is loose the band does cause the blouse to blouse out a bit but the fabric has a really nice drape to it so it worked fine the fabric has a gre,1
1301,Love these leggings the color i havent been able to find a pair of great brown leggings for years i was concerned the small might not fit but they are perfect,1
1302,Such a beautiful pattern on a lovely fabric soft to the touch and flows beautifully i love the lacing and even the butterfly sleeves which im usually not a fan or i have a feeling im going to wear this to death once the weather warms up my only complaint is the slip which is a scratchy material that is also completely see through its also very short at least for my comfort i have a plain black slip ill be using instead which is fine with me as i bought the dress for the outer shel,1
1303,Loved the design but jacket looked like years old because of a lot of piling even brand new jacket at store i wish they use better quality fabric so i would have purchased it,0
1304,Runs small great quality havent washed it yet but guessing it will shrink if i dry it awesome texture waffle knit i got the stripe it has a removable palm tree pin,1
1305,I really wanted to like this top but unfortunately it was short and the sleeves were just too puffy it did not look flattering and will be going back,0
1306,Im a tunic girlhave to admit that for me this top is fab i love roomy swingy tops and this is exactly that as others have mentioned it is quite roomy at the bottom however the weight of the fabric is so light it lays very nicely i love how it fits in the arms i hate when arms are too big the sleeve fits snugly for reference i am lbs the small fit perfectly i have already worn several times to work perfect in the ac,1
1307,I love this coat i bought it in and it still looks great in i only wear it a few times each season but it makes me smile its tailored feminine and a bit flashy its fairly warm too,1
1308,This dress is slightly tight on me and i usually wear petite or xxs lbs the quality of the fabric is thick and texture colors are just like the photo and it has a nice satin like underlining in a dark navy the snug fit of the dress makes it so i dont need a bra which is nice especially for a day dress,1
1309,This sweater is really fun and even cuter in person,1
1310,I do love this dress i wore it for my th anniversary party and received numerous compliments its great for embracing your curves it has a wonderful vintagemademodern flair that classic retailer pieces always have you do have to be careful when wearing itjewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on it is just that unique i hope that retailer continues to carry these t,1
1311,I have the charisma sheath by the same designer and love it so much i thought id try this one looks so much better in person than in the picture its extremely flattering on my curve less frame whenever i wear it to work i get stopped and asked where i got it great dress youll love it more in real life,1
1312,I really did not need another coat at all but i couldnt resist got it in green its dark and woodsysomething robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish the structure is just right this coat is soft cozy and fluid but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment equally wellsuited to wear on winter eve dog walks to a football game or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table works with most of my wardrobe,1
1313,I ordered two of these in orange as holiday gifts this year both were loved great style and quality will hopefully make this a goto sweater for both recipients,1
1314,I purchased this in the yellow xs it is very comfortable but extremely seethrough youd have to wear a slip or something underneath it but im not sure what would work based on the style and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still seethrough unfortunately i had to return it,0
1315,These pants fit well are cute and are comfortable they are a nice alternative to jeans,1
1316,This pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans soft sexy without being skintight and the perfect color of blue i am lbs and the was a perfect fit these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing think legs that look a mile long with booties one night and nude heels the next,1
1317,The torso runs a bit long but this is otherwise a comfortable and cute dress,1
1318,I agree with the other reviewer the colors were fabulous but it was boxy and fit me like a sack the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits it was really a cute idea and im sad it didnt work i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chancei should have listened,0
1319,I bought this in both yellow and green what a gorgeous and flatttering top that fits beautifully i love this top,1
1320,When i saw this sweater it made me think of the s chic trend thats very now but due to the colors my favorite tones it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress see photo i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress paeonia dress and i paired it with the rosebud layered necklace i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out i am and even thoug,1
1321,Thought this would be great for a laidback wedding in new mexico but didnt fit i am a and the barely fit my chest and arms not flattering material did not seem very breakthable had to return better luck next time,0
1322,My hearts aflutter for this top the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it and the little fluttery cap sleeves are to die for ive ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt especially in green and the double stripe jacquard skirt but im certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt its so flattering and comfortable with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le,1
1323,Great maxi skirt that flows as you walk i can see myself wearing this year round im and its still pretty long on me i would have gotten the petite if it were available i usually wear a or in pants and the medium skirt was perfect for me so you may want to size down unless you have bigger hips im not usually a fan of the drawstring waist but this one doesnt add bulk like most do overall great skirt,1
1324,Tried on my normal size in the store and i was swimming in it the sales associate suggested i order the petite in store perfect i just wish there were more opportunities to try on petite sizes in storethis coat is soft and roomy when its buttoned up it has a great shape too,1

1331,I absolutely loved this the minute i saw it the quality is impeccable and the fit is amazing i will agree with the other reviewer in that the fabric is very thick back to the quality of this piece amazing and some women may not like the extra bulk to that part of the body however im still on the hunt now for the perfect white top to go with it thank you retailer for always providing unique quality pieces,1
1332,I love this top its so comfortable and light weight it drapes beautifully with an overall loose fit but a little slimmer at the bottom so flattering i only wish i bought them in every color before they ran out,1
1333,Great jeans in a lovely shade of grey they are longer than shown in the picture however which i love i havent worn mine yet and i wonder how stretched out theyll get but overall the fit is quite flattering,1

1341,This jumper is so cute it is soft and you can dress it up or down depending on where your going,1
1342,I absolutely love this vest it fits extremely well and falls nicely i find the collarlapel billows or flaps out and away from the interior of the vest and i wish they were sewn or secured down when you tie the string around your waist the lapel doesnt lay flat but if you style it like the online model and tie the string off to tighten around your waist you get a very flattering look the color and fabric is great quality and really nice in person im overall really happy with this vest,1
1343,The moment i saw this dress i knew i had to have it the plaid is beautiful with tones of red blue and periwinkle the photos on the website are very true the unexpected pockets make it even cuter i also got the sandals as pictured because i love the whole look i an and usually wear a or i got the small and then wondered if it were too big i ended up going back and trying on the extra small but it turns out the small was correct it should hang and drape and it not meant to be f,1
1344,I love this blouse i wasnt sure if i was going to like the high neck but it fits the style the quality is excellent i bought a size small and i wear a size or xss in retailer most of the time i could have worn the xs if i was a little smaller busted c im and i didnt like where the gathering hit with the xs very flowy without looking like a maternity top its also lightly lined so i dont have to wear a cami warning this shirt is long if you are on the short side you may,1
1345,I wanted this top since the first time i saw it it fits perfectly in a small as i usually wear a small or medium it would probably fit better if you are smaller on top i am a a as it is not generously sized it flares at the bottom which looks quite flattering the lace on the sleeves really adds a lot of style i will wash it carefully as i am not sure how well the lace will hold up with washing this is a beautiful top and i am considering buying another in a different color i think,1
1346,The sweater material was really soft and seemed wellmade the back is an interesting twist but the material creases easily i can see it looking messy by the end of the day the main reason i returned it though was because it runs very large i got my usual s and i could have sized down maybe even sizes i didnt like it enough to try a smaller size,0
1347,This is such an adorable tee the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee i tried the xs and at and pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me love this tee and highly recommend this one,1
1348,These are great wear anywhere shorts they are not too long and not too short they are very soft and comfy i ordered a size and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps i will still keep the s for wearing around the house,1

1350,Love love love this shirt much like last years bordeaux shirt in this style its very soft very flattering and very comfortable fits tts and the fabric is a very soft stretchy cotton yet not too clingy around the mid section it has a nice flowy fit it washes great doesnt pill again the fabric is fantastic and holds up really well i bought the black with white stripes this year but im tempted to get every color its great for layering too since the fabric is nice and thin,1
1351,After reading every review i was certain i knew exactly what i was getting with this dress wrong i sized up from a small to a medium and the dress was still uncomfortably tight on my rib cage the top is very exposing of the bust and im small busted i cant stand wearing camis so there no way id be able to wear this dress even if i sized up again to a large for reference im a straight build lbs and wear a pluses on this dress are i loved the green color and length of sk,0
1352,I saw this dress in a store the other day it is so cute in real life i dont think the pictures online even begin to show how cute it is on the dress is wellmade and it fit perfectly in fact it is quite flattering i am so happy i saw it in the store even though i am big online shopper i would have passed on this dress if i only saw it online but dont because it is worth every penny,1
1353,Got for a mother day gift think she will like it because she always at the beach and is very happy go lucky new mother,1
1354,I bought the blue in store and loved it so much that my hubby recommended i buy the raspberry online i usually buy a medium in tops but went with the small so it wouldnt be so flowy fabric is soft and not itchy i will be wearing these a lot this fall,1

1359,Love this dress it is simultaneously romantic sexy and sweet could be a casual dress but also worn with heels it does run a little large but it is flowy and not meant to be super tight i am d and the top isnt too tight ordered the size and am very happy with the fit,1

1363,I own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for springsummer tops and dresses i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back it is lovely for sizing i tried my normal size b and the cup size larger per other reviews the c did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size excited for warmer weather,1

1365,I am tall and this sweater is a great length very flattering slightly loose across the tummy i have the redmauve color and may order the gray too super soft medium weight sweater very versatile love,1
1366,I tried this dress on in the store i loved the fabric and color but the fit was huge no matter how much i sized down there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose but this was shapeless in an unflattering way i was attracted to the style and color but the execution left much to be desired,0
1367,If youve been searching for red crops gotta give these a try i bought my normal size and they fit perfectly theyre a little more snug on me in the butt and thigh than on the model but theyre super flattering and the color is wonderful fabric is a tad thin really stretchy in a good way and the weight is great for summer i havent worn them yet so im not sure if theyll keep theyre shape fingers crossed,1
1368,It takes perfection for me to pay this much for a pair of pants and these delivered i bought these pants loveatfirstsight in the carbon color i have not washed them yet so i cant comment on durability but they fit like a dream i carry extra weight in my thighs and rear and these pants are very flattering and slimming and dont pull and crease in the crotch area like so many other pants do on my body my usual size fit perfectly and the length is great on my frame i can almost,1

1371,Another perfect maxi from retailer the print is feminine and can be easily dressed up or dressed down i ordered my normal size in maxis medium and the top fits nice and snug but not too tight i am busty and the neckline is high enough that i dont feel like i am showing too much cleavage it is a little long on me when i have flip flops on but with a little platform sandal it will be perfect,1
1372,I love the lace on this top its perfect its great for my shape imso happy with this purchase,1
1373,I laughed to myself as i pulled these jeans on in the dressing room expecting them to look ridiculous instead i was amazed at how well they fit how cool they looked and how comfortable they were two sizes smaller than my usual yes this yo woman rocked these jeans i love the intricate whiskering raw leg opening and worn dirty wash usually i do not like the dirty look but this is good dirty try them on you may just fall for them,1

1375,I got of these dresses one in the navy with small flowers and the grayyellow print i am and the navy looked a little old fashioned on me i think if you are younger it would be super cute the grayyellow diagonal stripe is super cute its a more modern design in the fabric and i love it it will be my favorite go to dress for the summer i also think it will pack nicely for trips i am and wear a small or medium with retailer clothes and i got a small in this dress and its p,1
1376,Lovelove love this it is so different and unique definitely not something you will see in any other store wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece so retailer it was very warm and comfortable i did wear a turtleneck under this because of reviews of itching i did not have any problems,1
1377,This dress is stretchy and soft a great length and an out of this world pattern it will probably be flattering on every body but it certain flattered mine,1
1378,I really liked this dress online and i loved it in person the print is different the waist is synched skirt is full has a very feminine shape definitely a special piece runs large im usually a in dresses and an in skirts im s c and then was noticeably too big size fit perfect and im no size no sleeves will make if easy to add a denim jacket or a cardigan it hits approx above the knees but has a conservative high neckline and back is covered good quali,1
1379,This dress is absolutely gorgeous every time i wear it people just dont stop admiring it great material and great fit,1
1380,I must be the lone dissenter but i am in love with this piece a dark cami underneath really make the eyelet pop i probably would not have liked it if it did not have the clasp as it does run wide however with skinny jeans or slim pants this works bc its loose in the right ways it may not be for everyone but its one of my faves right now,1
1381,I love jumpsuits except for this one the fabric is blah its between plastic and the material that they make flags out of the print is adorable and the buttons up the front are super cute the tie thing thats just hanging there its a tie thing that just hangs there it doesnt look good hanging and it doesnt look good tied this jumpsuit had so much potential im definitely disappointed for sizing reference i am c and a small was perfect,0
1382,This dress is absolutely darling it is light as a feather and floats on the body the fabric looks almost handpainted and fits like a dream i disagree with the previous poster and i think it looks very rich super comfortable and i know ill get lots of wear out of it you can dress it up or dress it down love it,1

1384,Love this shirt and the details on the collar,1
1385,Beautiful sweatshirt top that can be worn to work,1
1386,I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening after seeing the other reviews i wasnt sure about it but i was very pleased when it arrived i find it is elegant and sexy but also modest enough when i sized up by i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly it is formfitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight im excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace,1
1387,Ive been hesitant with crushed velvet comebackbut this dress is adorable first it is not a tent on me its the perfect fit for the style not too swingy but definitely not fitted this is the dress you can grab on a day you dont feel like sucking it in throw a blazer over it if you need you look professional wear to a girls brunch with booties or a night out with the hubs the little extra detail i didnt see online that was a pleasant style surprise is the almost straplooking piece,1
1388,Great cardigan love the tie on the back of the collar excited i was able to get the blue on sale definitely runs big but the small fits me well,1
1389,I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them well today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring the material is very soft light and flowy and im sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a,1
1390,This is what a bathing suit should look and feel like no crawling up the cheeks no spillage out the front i would say its true to size or a little on the large size im and ordered a medium which was great for me maybe a small would have been ok but i couldnt be happier good job color is true to the pic quality seems nice and sturdy,1
1391,This was not what i was expecting at all i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around the large fit like a small on me and not like a typical oversized sweater type small but a normal fitted top small a previous reviewer said it is long and straight and i think that is a good description for it i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extralarge or a different cut of the,0
1392,Fun dress to wear i received numerous compliments on the color and design of the dress very flowy and comfortable love it i wish i had bought a size smaller than i normally wea because it runs large but an overall great dress,1
1393,I so wanted to love the striped peplum top however i have a petite frame with a large chest and there was absolutely no support in the top not flattering in the least for a ddd cup will be returning i imagine this would be perfect for someone with a frame like mary kate or ashley olsen,0
1394,Sits slightly below waist i bought size p length is good no alteration required for petite height and lb material is good and i recommend them,1
1395,These jeans fit so well and are made of really high quality denim soft and comfortable but not too much stretchjust enough im short so i have to cuff them i kinda wish they came in petite or ankle length but they look cute cuffed too,1
1396,This is definitely my go to top for work weekends or night out with the husband ive worn it with skinny jeans black tights and skirts it goes with just about anything easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo,1
1397,I think this dress is adorable it fits great wear it with heels or cowboy boots you will not be disappointed,1
1398,I love the colors my favorite purchased a medium and fits perfectly ive been wearing it all summer material is thin but super soft for reference i am lbs dd im obsessed with this tank considering buying a second just in case anything happens to the one i have thats how much i love this tank,1
1399,The idea of this shirt is awesome it just needs to be made longer and not so boxy the ruffle is darling i would be so happy if the the designer made some modifications i think a lot of people would buy it then,0
1400,I love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite i am just under feet tall and usually wear a p in this brand this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me i returned this dress,0
1401,Im a c and lbs i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect the sleeves are just the right length it fits through the chest and hips the leather and other material is super soft i love the dark brown color its just as pictured like someone else said you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look this is my new favorite jacket,1
1402,The print is awesome,1
1403,A while back the moss ikat print appealed to me online but sometimes these style tops look maternity on me so i passed up well abt a month ago i spotted the moss in the store had to try it it really is cute love the print even more in person the size was fine but the armholes exposed the bra a little i wondered if it wld be a little too short after washing well the size was a little longer a tad more flowy oddly the armholes covered the bra the didnt i went w the siz,1
1404,This is a perfect dress for work or fun flattering and flow with lovely little subtle details,1
1405,I thought this sweater was cute online but turns out it is even cuter in person the cotton linen blend makes it easy to layer over a tee shirt or blouse and the neutral color goes with everythingas a side note included with my sweater was a signed postcard informing me that this item was not on hand at their distribution center so they sounded the horns and their spokane wa store saved the day thank you spokane wa store and thank you meredith for packing with care i love it,1
1406,This shirt is made of fabric so soft you can practically feel it with your eyes i saw it right when i walked into the store and knew that i had to have it it is unlike any fabric ive ever had a soft twoply almost gauzy cotton one cute detail is that the inside layer is a smaller windowpane plaid than the outside layer so cute and so soft one thickness above cheesecloth i would say and like cheesecloth it has a natural give within the weave but it is not stretchy the shoulders,1
1407,Great dress the hardest part was picking which color the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas lower abdomen and hips the dress is modest enough for work it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle comes to my knee on the sides i am always a xs or s in maeve i went with the small on this dress the sleeves arent as long as the picture shows they ended where they should i went with the navy and w,1
1408,I disliked this dress it didnt fall on me the way it falls on the model pictured i think it would work well for tall thin women with a smaller chest i am petite with a larger chest and it accentuated my chest in an unflattering way and managed to make me look frumpy at the same time not recommended for petite women,0
1409,This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on im sure it will be a go to for many occasions,1
1410,This dress is the opitome of summer day or night running errands during the day to a casual night out this dress will be that go to favorite i feel it runs small on the top i am large busted and i sized up for this reason and it still could be roomieri wear a size on top and for referance i got the i will keep it as it is not uncomfortable but for a drees that lends to a drape on top i wish they would have made it roomierimhave never had this issue with mauve as it is one of my,1
1411,Gorgeous pattern and colors for autumn maeve does me good when it comes to maxi dresses i have to say that the sizing is all over the place i am generally a medium but the small and xs fit me well also the stretchiness of the jersey is very comfortable and forgiving except at the ruched waistband which took longer to stretch out but it did eventually i do need to hem if i want to wear flats but the length works for my higher heels there are pockets and a lining to my knees i am,1
1412,I specifically bought this dress for my bridal shower and loved it im small on top and have hips that dont lie i purchased the size petite the waist portion of the dress came up a little higher which was ok since it fell at a small part of my waist the length was just above my knee which i prefer the dress has a nude lining which compliments my tan skin tone i wore a regular nude bra that didnt show beneath the liner i received many compliments and would highly recommend it the,1
1413,Perfect fit and ive gotten so many compliments i buy all my suits from here now,1
1414,This is a gorgeous dress it comes with a black silky belt but mine was too large which is probably why it is not shown on the model photos i think maybe it only works if youre on the larger size for the dress its very easy to get on and off due to the front zipper i was worried about bra straps showing on the low cut back but they actually show more at the broad shoulders im not sure if thats more apparent because i went up on the size to have room at the hips there is a cute kick p,1
1415,I purchased the grey color and i love love love everything about this dress the fabric is so soft and feels like pjs im just shy of and the length is perfect for work i purchased the medium the fit was perfect for me size lbhighly recommended,1
1416,Love it easy to wear true to size there is a slight texture which makes it very cozy,1
1417,Love love love these the model does not do them justice since she makes them look like high rise pants they are very soft with stretch which is why i sized down i usually wear a you can remove the roll and they fit perfect w a heel for those curvy women they look great also have a slouchy appeal too but tailored i went everywhere looking for chinos and these are the best ones out there for reference i am pounds and just losing weight from having a baby and absolutely,1
1418,Yep i used to have a nice body but now have the dreaded menopause stomach and some excess baggage this dress was very flattering wore it today easter sunday and had literally a dozen people seek me out to tell me how great the dress was or how nice i looked it is a bright pink think pepto bismol heavy brocade type fabric plus a great cut hiding my stomach and rear plus the lower neckline emphasized my nicer areas very pleased to find a dress for us older women to look fresh and f,1
1419,I am a solid and the size l fit nicely its easy to wear the diagonal print is quite flattering my husband liked it i am and it was a bit short but not too short ive not washed it yet so cant say how that will go the fabric is knit but does not look like it will pill,1

1421,I bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it the color is lovely i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully i am so glad such an easy piece to throw on very comfortable fit is great,1
1422,I love this suit and have gotten so many compliments on it i weigh lbs and ordered a s typically i order xs but am glad i went with the size up the coloring is beautiful the legs are high cut flattering the top has no padding and shows a seamless result highly recommend,1
1423,Love this denim and particular wash button fly will last forever looks so cute rolled a little on the cuff,1
1424,I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product as soon as i put this tunic the right tie loop detached from the garment i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product,0
1425,I bought the light grey color the dress in the photo does not look a thing like the dress in person it does not look grey at all but more of a light teallight blue it is absolutely gorgeous and has a slight swing shape i took my normal size xs the end of the sleeves where the buttons are are very tight but still fit you just have to be careful taking off or else undo the buttons also online inventory says no one has this in store but i did end up finding it rockefeller,1
1426,This is very cute in person i love the colors a tiny bit brighter in person it is very feminine with the ruffles but with an edge not too foofoo i tried no the regular size and it was a little short even on me i would have to wear with higher rise pants or show some belly no petite on this one the size fit me at lbs and dd chest the material is light and airy so great for warmer days love it but in my wish list didnt get it yetthough the day it showed up at my loca,1
1427,This dress fits so perfectly just the right amount of skin not too bare not too short not too long cant wait to wear it great quality,1
1428,This robe is incredibly soft it is wonderful to put on right after a shower and it is very warm the sleeves are lined with a jersey like material and they are so easy to get on and off it fits true to size i am so excited to have this robe,1
1429,I now own this shirt in different styles although i dont expect it to last forever thus far they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight i love the simple cut and how good they look dressed up or down it is so hard to find comfy tees and this one fits the bill my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black then i would own,1
1430,I cant say enough about these pants they are such good quality i bought the xs they are tight enough and dont create crease in my legs length is perfect for my statue,1
1431,The good the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute now the bad the material is wretched it feels damp even when its not its see through and unlined its scratchy and wrinkly and though the cut of the dress would be fine the fabric is so limp that the highlow hem looks more like a tail i wanted to like this but charging nearly dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable i returned it as fast as i possibly c,0
1432,This is absolutely beautiful the picture online doesnt do it justice i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly fit was a little large i would have tried a petite but this shirt doesnt come in petite sizes love this,1
1433,Gorgeous dress it was designed to accentuate a womans figure lovely material holds everything in place without being too revealing the dress does not lose its shape definitely a head turner,1
1434,Bought with the off retailer was running usually a little skeptical of maeve regarding size but the material of these shirts is excellent bought the ski print and the red penguin print perfect for lowkey and where i work,1
1435,I tried this cardigan on today at retailer and i absolutely loved it its much cuter in real life than it looks online its a perfect sweater for my skinny jeanslong sweatertall boots winter uniform,1
1436,The colors on these leggings are very nice and the fit was fabulous the waist is high enough to hold in a slight muffin top and the control in the fabric is just right i received several compliments on them and hubby really liked them,1
1437,I really love this coat it is beautiful and very comfortable while the attached scarf does cover the cute buttons im glad it is there it comes in handy when the temperature drops quicker than anticipated the only thing missing on this coat is a lining as soft as the exterior,1
1438,Love the lines of this tweed look jacket pockets are a definite plus as is the soft pleat in the back this is a good piece to transition from winter to spring it updates your jeans and soft tshirt look,1
1439,I tried this one on twice before i committed to it but im so glad i did this top has a lot of volume it is fitted in the arms but stretchy has quite a large neckhole but lays beautifully on my neck and shoulders and has a lot of volume on bottom what i love about it is the variance in length at the hem its long in the front and back then comes up on the sides this makes the top really feminine and lovely its the perfect top for women who carry weight in their belly or butti,1
1440,I ordered both colors but ended up keeping the green in petite xs bc the red in xs was just slightly too big both colors are gorgeous and i agree they have a retro s vibe just a tad itchy but not enough that it would make an undershirt absolutely necessary ill probably just wear it alone i think the regular size would work for most petites bc its not ridiculously long i would suggest sizing down in regular if youre petite though for instance the regular xs fit noticeably larger,1
1441,This skirt looks and feels cheap and the color is much more green than pictured additionally i comfortably wore a size and then lost a few pounds and this is still way too tight to be flattering,0
1442,Beautiful and flowy blouse bottom is very full so i recommend sizing down size very feminine and i really like the colors and pattern i am a c on top and found top flattering with pilcro serif legging like jeans and booties,1
1443,Love this top and wish they had more colors in xs but the sale was too good so they were sold out im lbs an xs fits great will go with jeans or leggings,1
1444,This sweater is super flattering love the cowl neck and longer length it is not boxy or shapeless but manages to show off your figure without clinging anywhere i did not find any of the colors to be see through as some other reviewers had noted i purchased the navy and think ill go back for the brown as well size down if between sizes i am and busty and the medium fit great,1
1445,Love this dress fits true to size can be dressed up or down very flattering prettier in person,1
1446,Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice its got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent colorful sheen it can be dressed up or down worn with a number of various styles jeans dress pants skirts the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit the front is an unforgiving acetate dry clean only hand wash will ruin this piece i normally wear a small but it was tight in the chest c so i went with a medium and it worked fine no stretch in the acetate,1
1447,This is great lightweight top layer thats just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down or on a breezy day its sheer so it requires a bottom layer the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model which i like,1
1448,I am short and curvy and this shirt swallowed me sleeves were especially long,0
1449,The colors are so much brighter than pictured although the sweater is very comfortable i did not like the color combination i will be returning it,0

1454,I am not generally a fan of sweatshirts but when i saw this on a recent retailer email i new i had to check it out the colors are more vibrant in person and not muted like the photo but this wasnt a deal breaker for me because of the boxy shape i went with a s i love the cozy feel and that it is still stylish i can see this piece getting a lot of use this fallwinter in fact i am wearing it right now,1
1455,Very different i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings,1
1456,I fell in love with this sweater as soon as i saw it i was a little unsure what the quality would be like just from the photos but i went ahead and ordered it and it is even more amazing in person its super soft and well made its also very warm even though it has such a large open weave the price is definitely higher than i would normally pay but this is a piece that will stay in your closet and wardrobe rotation for years and years definitely worth the investment i agree with the pre,1
1457,This is an amazing swimsuit i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece i wanted something a bit on the modest side but still sexy and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive enter this swimsuit from retailer i fell in love with the teal dot print as its unlike anything else ive seen its absolutely spectacular in person i love the vibrant blue and the chic d,1
1458,This is an amazingly soft and gorgeous sweater i typically avoid this brand because most of their pieces run smaller on my frame however this not only fit perfect but it is a beautiful color as well i prefer transitional pieces that can be worn multiple seasons and this one is just right,1
1459,Great summer pants real wide leg fit perfect even my muscular thighs run a little roomy right of the rack but stretch out terribly in my regular size they start falling off after few hours of wear long dragging on the floor on my frame,1

1465,Im happy to say i got this on the sale rack but had been eyeing this long before it is a flattering fit on me in size large i just love the colors in the print also the style is not a basic shell but a very feminine cut the skinny straps are also a very nice touch i plan on wearing this with my long white linen skirt denim capris or with shorts i think i will also opt for a solid cardi or scarf this is just so pretty,1
1466,The colors style and fit were great this dress you could wear on many different occasions all around great piece to own,1
1467,I love love this sweater its beautiful on and super comfy my only complaint is that it had a snag and a hole in the back so i cant say its good quality,1
1468,This romper is sooo comfortable and cute it is definitely pretty casual and probably best used as a beach cover up as it exposes a lot of skin that being said i have worn it out and about on very hot days and felt totally fine as far as sizing i usually order a small and got this in a small and it fit perfectly,1
1469,Love this shirt it is long enough in back to wear with leggings it is very cute and casual on not fitted at all i am and ordered a regular size so that it fits longer,1
1470,Aside from the beautiful colors what drew me to this skirt is the wide waistband i love that it can hold in a bit of a tummy and accommodate a belt or not when i received this in the mail a few days ago i immediately started pulling articles of clothing out of my closet to go with the skirt a striped tee chambray top belt denim jacket the quality is great and it has pockets i have a waist and went with my usual size i am and ordered a petite so it hits a couple inches abo,1
1471,I love this blouse it is soft and has nice drape even though it is very voluminous on the bottom the truetosize cut of the arms and shoulders as well as the seaming in back keep it crisply tailored and not overwhelming thinking about buying more prints,1
1472,This trench coat is the best fit and feeltrue to size and cozy excellent material,1
1473,Heres the thing this is a sweatercoat its not a coat its not something ill be able to wear independently by the end of november though im enjoying doing so now its boiled wool and not lined and though its cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high s its role is going to end up being a mid layer im also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work serving as a kind of cardiganblazer combinationi purchased the pink which i saw online first a,1

1475,Love this skirt its like a denim feel so there is good structure love the colors anything goes with it and i love pockets very comfortable day skirt for just around town,1
1476,I love these jeans i bought my normal size but after just two hours of wearing them they had stretched out so much that i could take them off without unbuttoning them i probably could have gone two sizes smaller but i wanted them to fit loose my local store was willing to offer me an exchange kudos to retailers wonderful customer service and standing by their products i actually wear mine uncuffed with boots and it looks super cute,1
1477,The detail and overall quality of the fabric is incredible i normally avoid swing dresses but this is a flattering dress i typically wear between sizes depending on designer and a fit me perfectly im extremely happy that i purchased it and received compliments as soon as i wore it out im also tall so i have to be concerned with length of dresses and this falls perfectly right at the top of the knee,1

1479,I wasnt sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that its by postmark and has an interesting cut i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy it is that and more the lightweight sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring i look forward to wearing it tomorrow,1
1480,I was bummed about this top detail on back is pretty even so not worth it im usually an xs im lbs and it fit true to size guess i had higher expectations im feel consistently let down with what the pictures convey and the actual item when it arrives in person,0
1481,This dress will unfortunately be returnedso cute online and looks like a sack in person runs very large arm holes are very low not flattering,0

1483,I just scored this dress the other day and i dont regret it for a second the bodice is beaded with some seafoam green beads and they are sewn on really well so i am not worried about dropping them all night from the pictures i couldnt tell if this was going to look like a cotton skirt or i fit would be chiffon lookingit is neither it has a shimmer to it which makes this a more dressy looking dress than i was originally anticipatingi thought it was going to be an everyday wear type of d,1
1484,This sweater looks exactly as represented in the picture the detail on the cuffs neckline and hemline make it unique and set it apart from the typical patterned sweater ive worn it twice already and im very pleased,1
1485,I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the frontmaking this a dramaticly gorgeous piece i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump,1
1486,Im not the type of woman that wears dresses but oh manthis dress ive been eyeing it for a while and it finally went on sale then the extra off made me cave got it for i bought it one size smaller to encourage me to not overindulge this xmas and if fit like a glove for reference im bust waist and normally a size in retailer it accentuates your curves hugs your body while being sexyconservative the intricate embroidery is exquisite and very eye catching,1
1487,Super soft and cute the buttons add a nice touch the color depicted online gave me pause but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic great investment beautiful sweater c and the small is perfect,1
1488,These joggers are super cute and comfortable in addition to being stylish they have beautiful colors and design if these were presented in other colors i would buy those as well small fit perfectly,1
1489,Pilcro denim with embellishment like this always wins me over these pair of jeans fit well the detail is so pretty for fall cant wait until it cools off to wear these the price point is a little high considering the silly shipping costs too love the jeans though,1
1490,The fabric of this dress is warm soft and comfortable it is versatile and can be worn at both work or out for a casual evening date it is cute without a belt but i prefer one just to give it more shape i plan to wear it often this season i am b and purchased a size small,1
